1
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:54,582
<i>London in the 1960s.</i>

2
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:57,124
<i>Everyone had a story about the Krays.</i>

3
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,874
<i>You could walk into any pub
to hear a lie or two about them.</i>

4
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,915
<i>But I was there
and I'm not careless with the truth.</i>

5
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:09,623
<i>They were brothers,
but bound by more than blood.</i>

6
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,664
<i>They were twins as well,
counterparts.</i>

7
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:16,831
<i>Gangster princes
of the city they meant to conquer.</i>

8
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,456
<i>Ron Kray was a one-man London mob.</i>

9
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:23,789
<i>Bloodthirsty, illogical
and funny as well.</i>

10
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,914
<i>My Reggie was different.</i>

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,789
<i>Once in a lifetime do you find
a street-fighting man like Reg.</i>

12
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:32,873
<i>Believe me when I say</i>

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,706
<i>it took a lot of love
for me to hate him the way I do.</i>

14
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:50,289
- Morning, Albie.
- Morning, son.

15
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,789
- Is that tea for two?
- All right, Albie?

16
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:01,373
Hello, boys.

17
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:05,290
How you doing? You all right?
Got you a cup of tea here. You fancy it?

18
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:07,248
Yeah? No?

19
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,206
What's this?
The old Dagenham Anglia?

20
00:02:10,332 --> 00:02:13,373
Naught to 60 in, what, 40 minutes,
something like that?

21
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:19,414
Phwoar! It's a bit of you, that, innit,
all black and cramped and very sharp.

22
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,039
This one's really milky, for you.

23
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:23,748
Why don't you fuck off, Kray?

24
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,456
All right, I will. You know,
I wouldn't want to keep you,

25
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:30,664
what with all them rapists and murderers
you gotta lock away, Nipper?

26
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,498
Where do you take a turd in there?

27
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,956
I suppose you just hold it in,
don't you?

28
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:42,414
All right, then, have a lovely day.
Cheer up. It's nearly Christmas.

29
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,998
Sorry about that.

30
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,706
Where's me driver?
Where's Frank?

31
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:49,539
- Can't get out of bed in the morning, Reg.
- You what?

32
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:52,414
He ain't here. He ain't showed up.
His heart ain't in it.

33
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,914
All right, OK.
Well, let's go get him, then, shall we?

34
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,039
- Where is he? On Ormsby Street, yeah?
- Yeah. Jump in, I'll give you a lift.

35
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:01,873
Nah, you're all right. I'm gonna walk.
It's a lovely day for it.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,289
Don't forget this lot.
They're very important.

37
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:05,956
I won't.

38
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:07,956
Come on.

39
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:10,581
I shall walk incredibly slowly.

40
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:16,623
- All right, Vera?
- All right, Reg?

41
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,206
- How you doing? You good?
- Yeah.

42
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,664
Lovely.

43
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,581
Rita.

44
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,456
I was going to knock on your door.
Me mum said you left that in the kitchen.

45
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:26,831
- Oh, I did.
- That yours?

46
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,331
- It is. Oh, thanks ever so much.
- Not a problem. You're welcome.

47
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:31,789
Isn't he sweet?

48
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,914
East Enders.

49
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:40,248
They won't talk to a policeman,
but they'll kiss a gangster?

50
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:44,206
The filthy cockney bastards.

51
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,914
How about we clean your car for you?

52
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:02,373
You get the bumper
and I'll get the lights.

53
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:07,206
Frank about?

54
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,998
Frank!

55
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:14,998
Who are you?

56
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,165
Frances. Frank's sister.

57
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,874
Hang about, I recognize you.
See, I recognize you.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,749
You was a little bit younger then.
You got all grown up, didn't you?

59
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,124
It happens.

60
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,456
What have you got there?

61
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:32,915
A sweet.

62
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,456
That's not any sweet, is it?
That's a lemon sherbet, that is.

63
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:36,665
Mind if I have a crack?

64
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,124
All right.

65
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,206
Thank you.

66
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:44,456
Oh, that's nice, innit?

67
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,499
- You're not supposed to chew it.
- No?

68
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,499
How else am I supposed to get
to the sherbetty bit?

69
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,749
- By being patient.
- Nah!

70
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,624
Being patient doesn't get you
what you want, does it?

71
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,624
Half a minute, Reg. Right down.

72
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,581
- Is he in trouble?
- Yeah, he is.

73
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:13,499
Will you go out with me?
I'll go easy on him if you do.

74
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:17,999
All right.

75
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,999
But not for that reason.

76
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,456
Saturday night.

77
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,165
Who are you talking to?
You're half-dressed,

78
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,499
talking to a man in the door.
What's wrong with you, Frances?

79
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,499
Get back in the kitchen,
finish them dishes.

80
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,331
Hey, this is yours.

81
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,206
Thank you.

82
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:46,956
Oversleep again, Frank, all right,

83
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:49,874
and it's back to the cheese shop
or the fish shop

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,956
or whatever shop it was
you come from.

85
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:53,499
Print.

86
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,874
Print shop.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,624
Oh, yeah?

88
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,415
You'll be back to the fucking shit shop,
you understand?

89
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,415
- Yeah.
- What does your sister do?

90
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,249
She goes to one of those,
Pitman Colleges.

91
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,249
You know, typing, shorthand.

92
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,415
- Yeah?
- Yep.

93
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,331
She's got a bit of class, mate.
She's very elegant.

94
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,749
Where you been hiding her?

95
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,581
She been away.

96
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:20,540
She's a bit, fragile, Reg.

97
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:23,206
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

98
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:27,331
- All right.
- Stop here, Frank.

99
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,624
Five minutes. Won't be long.

100
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:43,749
How long you reckon it'll take
for him to twig, Albie?

101
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,165
Little bit of cat and mouse.

102
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:54,415
<i>Nipper Read was the copper
on the Krays' case.</i>

103
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,831
<i>And he made his presence known.</i>

104
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,874
<i>He was heavy-footed, as they say. '</i>

105
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,415
And I'm staring
at the back of this geezer's head.

106
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,249
The whole time I'm thinking, you know,

107
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:25,124
"Give Ron Kray your sausage.

108
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,499
"Give Ron

109
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,749
"your fucking sausage. "

110
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,956
You know?

111
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,540
I was drilling my eyes
into the back of his head.

112
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:50,790
Till I'm not even thinking it anymore.
I'm not... I'm not even thinking.

113
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,624
I'm broadcasting it.

114
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,081
Until he turns around
and you know what he says? He says...

115
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:04,456
"Hey, Ron, do you fancy my sausage?
I've got... I've got no appetite for it. "

116
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,415
Interesting.

117
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,915
<i>When my future brother-in-law
said "interesting"... '</i>

118
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,081
Ain't it?

119
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:15,706
<i>... it meant he had no fucking idea what he
or you or anyone else was talking about. '</i>

120
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,581
Fascinating, Ron.

121
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:21,790
Fascinating.

122
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:24,374
<i>Ron had been sentenced
to three years in prison</i>

123
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,665
<i>for grievous bodily harm.</i>

124
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,999
<i>Near the end of his sentence,
he was certified insane</i>

125
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,540
<i>and remanded to a mental hospital.</i>

126
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:33,999
<i>What was wanting
was a friendly psychiatrist.</i>

127
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,164
What's that?

128
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:39,499
When you say
you want to "raspberry' this man,

129
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,664
I'm not sure of your vernacular.
What do you mean?

130
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,331
Raspberry ripple, cripple.

131
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:47,249
You want to cripple someone?

132
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,206
- Yep, that's right.
- And why is that?

133
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:55,499
Because, Doctor,
I'm afraid he may not be inclined

134
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,999
to provide a favorable evaluation
of my employer.

135
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,499
And who's your employer?

136
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,874
Ronnie Kray.

137
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,249
Is there hope, Doctor?

138
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:11,706
Excuse me a moment.

139
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:16,331
Take your time.

140
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:20,706
Ronald Kray possesses
possibly the soundest mind I've seen

141
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:24,206
in 26 years of psychiatric practice.

142
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:28,831
In my view, to keep him here
would be a waste of public resources.

143
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:38,749
A lifetime's integrity down the toilet.

144
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,956
<i>The Queen would survive,
but God save the rest of us.</i>

145
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,956
Mr Kray.

146
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:52,999
I hope you know what you're doing.

147
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,249
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.
I'm going back to London, gonna take the...

148
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,331
Your brother has no real idea
who or what he is.

149
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:00,956
Nor does he trust his own senses.

150
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:04,456
I've never seen a man
so desperately in need of reassurance.

151
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:07,124
We all like a nice little compliment
now and again, don't we?

152
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,456
Your brother is arbitrary,
violent and psychopathic,

153
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:11,789
probably paranoid schizophrenic.

154
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,624
What I'm trying to tell you
is that he's off his fucking rocker.

155
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,249
It's called Stemetil.

156
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,374
You need to give it to your brother
twice a day

157
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,831
or there's going to be serious trouble.

158
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,914
Oi, Frances, the car's outside.

159
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:44,039
Oh!

160
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:47,789
You've got glamour, Frances.
You're like an East End starlet.

161
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,499
East End harlot's more like it.

162
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,331
They're trousers, Mum.
She doesn't look like a harlot.

163
00:10:52,457 --> 00:10:54,249
What she's wearing
doesn't matter.

164
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,499
When people see her with Reggie Kray,
they'll think she's a tart.

165
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,081
Why would you say that?

166
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:02,624
He's a gangster, Frances.
The Krays are gangsters.

167
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,499
- Well, I think he's sweet.
- Oh, God!

168
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,749
And I'm going to kiss him.
Do you hear me?

169
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,039
- Hello.
- Hello.

170
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,789
You look lovely.

171
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:26,289
So do you.

172
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,664
Hello. This is Big Pat.

173
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,374
- Hello, Big Pat.
- Reggie.

174
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,831
- How you doing? You all right, mate?
- Miss. Nice to see you.

175
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:47,956
Big Pat's here to keep riff-raff out.

176
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,789
Always.

177
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:51,539
So how come you're
letting us in, then, mate?

178
00:11:51,665 --> 00:11:53,499
Have a good night.

179
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,249
- Thank you.
- Thanks, mate. Cheers.

180
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,499
Oh, hello, here's trouble.
Hold the phone.

181
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:01,039
- Oi, you. How you doing, big man?
- You all right, boss?

182
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,624
- Are you well?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

183
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,999
- You behaving yourself?
- Always. I'm a teddy bear, me.

184
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,164
Go easy. If he gives you any trouble,
come and speak to me. Come on.

185
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,081
- You all right, ma'am?
- Yeah, I'm good. She's good.

186
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:12,456
- Hello, Reg.
- Hello.

187
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:14,831
Reg, you all right?
Mr Kray.

188
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:17,999
- Everyone here knows you.
- Yeah, well, I own it, it's my club.

189
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,789
- You mean it's your local?
- No, I own the place. It's mine.

190
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,039
I've been by here 10 times,
I never knew it was yours.

191
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,749
Well, you can get away with a lot in life
if you keep your mouth shut.

192
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,749
That's Teddy.
Hang on a second.

193
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,081
How you doing? You all right?
Good to see you. You good?

194
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:33,749
How's the family? Excellent.

195
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,624
- What?
- Those men look frightening.

196
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,164
No, no, they're just East End boxers.
They're lovely.

197
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,539
I let'em drink in here for free,
you know.

198
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:43,664
Reggie, that's Joan Collins.

199
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,039
Yeah, might be, yeah.

200
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,624
We had that Barbara Windsor in here
the other night.

201
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,581
- Really?
- She comes in quite a bit, actually.

202
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:52,039
She loves it.
And, that's my formula.

203
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:56,249
What I like to do is I like to mix celebrities
with a few, just a few, East End villains.

204
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,749
The punters, they love it.
It's really good for business.

205
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,999
Would you like a seat?

206
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,289
Excuse me, Reg.
Have you, got a moment?

207
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,331
No, I don't, actually.
I'm busy. All right?

208
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:08,664
- Nah, it's important, Reg.
- This is important as well, so...

209
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,124
- Reg.
- All right.

210
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,249
Frances, would you mind if I...

211
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,331
if I take care of some business
just for a moment?

212
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:17,999
- No, of course not.
- Excuse me. Be back in a minute.

213
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,874
You sit with her. What is it?

214
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,456
- It's back here.
- What?

215
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:23,499
- Hello, Reg.
- All right, mate?

216
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,581
In fact, if you don't know,
you don't fucking know.

217
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:29,289
- You know what I mean?
- Reggie.

218
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:34,081
How are you, Reg?

219
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:36,624
I'm all right. I can't complain.
Who'd fucking listen?

220
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,624
- What's the palaver? Go on.
- Sit down, Reg. Sit down, please.

221
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,789
All right.

222
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:43,914
You had a question about our take
in the purple heart business. Pill game.

223
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,374
- Go on.
- Jack here would like to explain himself.

224
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,539
Go on.

225
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:50,581
Go on, Jack.
Tell Reggie what you told me.

226
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,664
Well, Reg...

227
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,499
- Yeah?
- I...

228
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,831
The thing is, under normal
circumstances, my accounts...

229
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:05,789
Are you going to take all fucking night,
mate? Cause I've got things to do.

230
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,706
Tell him, Jack. Go on, spit it out.

231
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:11,706
- I borrowed a few quid off the top.
- Right. All right.

232
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:14,206
- I sold a few pills on the side.
- Yeah, there's a surprise.

233
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:16,164
Things have been a bit tight at home

234
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,081
and I was just trying
to keep the wife happy.

235
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:19,331
Trying to keep the wife happy.

236
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:22,624
Is this why you brought me in here,
for this? This nonsense?

237
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,289
- It's important business, Reg.
- It's important, is it? Yeah?

238
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,081
- You should know about this.
- All right, let's deal with this business.

239
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:32,164
Tomorrow, you come back to work,
and you pay back every fucking penny.

240
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,414
- I was going to suggest that.
- Good. Right. Are we done?

241
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,499
Everybody happy?

242
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,831
All right, then, can I get back
to my fucking evening?

243
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:42,831
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Albie. Cheers.

244
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:45,624
- Sorry for wasting your time, Jack.
- Thanks.

245
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,874
Thanks for coming in.

246
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,831
Here you go, mate.

247
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,624
Good?

248
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,624
You fucking little thieving cunt.
You understand?

249
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,914
I heard me. Yeah?

250
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,039
Next time I'll finish you off,
you little slag.

251
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,249
- Get him out of here. Fuck him off.
- Fuck!

252
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,374
You fucking what?
What did you say?

253
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,164
Don't you swear in my club.
Get him out of here right now.

254
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,789
Don't swear in my club. Wanker.

255
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,581
- Listen, there's something else.
- No, there isn't something else,

256
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,039
'cause I've got a young lady in here
and I'm entertaining.

257
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,249
- Have a look at that. See that there?
- I see it.

258
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,914
I'm entertaining, all right?
So I'm gonna have an evening to myself.

259
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,624
- This is important business.
- Can't be. My business, innit?

260
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,999
It's my business. I would know.

261
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,831
Night, Albie.

262
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:35,581
Hello.
Did I miss anything important?

263
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:39,164
- No, just me.
- Now, that is important.

264
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,414
- Is it?
- Very important.

265
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,749
Thank you.

266
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:53,249
So, your brother, he was telling me
that you, you're going to college

267
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:57,081
to... to study to be a secretary.
Is that right?

268
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,456
Yeah, anything
to get out of the East End.

269
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:02,081
What's so bad about the East End?

270
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:06,289
I've just got bigger dreams than pushing
a pram or haggling with the butcher.

271
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:10,499
I just don't quite know
what they are yet.

272
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,414
Well, the East End's not that bad.

273
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,331
The center of the earth
can be anywhere you like.

274
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:18,124
- Even here?
- Yeah, even here.

275
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,539
- In Bethnal Green?
- Yeah, Bethnal Green.

276
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,206
Do you like being a gangster?

277
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,581
I'm not a gangster.

278
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:37,164
I'm a club owner.

279
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:44,331
I like the money and I like the respect
of being a club owner.

280
00:16:44,457 --> 00:16:45,999
But I'm not a gangster.

281
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:50,249
I could have been a boxer,

282
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,749
but then, you know... hello, mate...

283
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,749
I'd end up looking like
some sort of potato.

284
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,956
And I wouldn't even know
what day of the week it was.

285
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:00,664
This way, at least I know
who I am, you know?

286
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:04,832
More so, I like the fact that
I've made a little something of myself.

287
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,082
I don't owe the world anything.

288
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:10,789
So long as the world agrees with you.

289
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:14,499
I think the world will be all right.

290
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,249
<i>We shall fight on the beaches.</i>

291
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,874
<i>We shall fight on the landing grounds.</i>

292
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,332
<i>We shall fight in the fields...</i>

293
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,914
<i>... and in the streets.</i>

294
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,332
<i>We shall fight in the hills.</i>

295
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,582
<i>We shall never surrender, and if...</i>

296
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,624
Hey, Ronnie!

297
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,749
Ronnie, come on out.
You've got visitors, mate.

298
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,999
Watch your step. It's a bit wet.

299
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,207
- You all right?

300
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,582
- You must be Frances.
- Hello.

301
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,874
Hello, Frances. Hello.
Welcome to the family.

302
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,664
Well, it's a bit premature,
that, is it?

303
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,664
- You don't have a beer that I could have?
- Yeah, of course I do. Help yourself.

304
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,624
Don't mind if I have a beer, do you?

305
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,874
I'll let you get to know each other.

306
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,332
Want a cup of tea?
I just put the kettle on.

307
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,624
Take a seat. Go on.

308
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,874
Sit down anywhere you like.

309
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,999
Needs a bit of warming up. So...

310
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,039
What do you think?

311
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:33,624
Do you think that we look alike,
me and Reggie?

312
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,082
Oh, yes, certainly.

313
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,539
No, you don't.
You think that he's beautiful

314
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:39,499
and I've got a face
like a gorilla's arse.

315
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,374
It's all right, don't worry about it.

316
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,332
- No. I wouldn't say that.
- I'm used to it.

317
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,999
Stop doing your hair, right?
Get me stuff out of the car.

318
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,539
Do something fucking useful.

319
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,499
Yeah, go on, then.

320
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,539
I'm homosexual, Frances.

321
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:08,332
Well, I am a, I'm a giver, right?
I'm not a receiver.

322
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,082
There is a difference. I'm not a faggot.

323
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:15,289
But I do believe that, you know,
you should not hide what you are.

324
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:19,582
You shouldn't hide what you are
'cause it'll make you very sad, you know?

325
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,457
It'll make you very sad.
It'll make you very unwell.

326
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,499
- I agree completely.

327
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,624
You know, me and my brother,
we're going to rule London.

328
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,914
<i>The Krays' main rivals
were the Richardsons of South London.</i>

329
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,789
<i>They were called the Torture Gang.</i>

330
00:19:38,915 --> 00:19:42,164
For the benefit of the jury,

331
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,374
on whose behalf were you operating
on this side of the river?

332
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,249
Come on, Charlie, please.
I'm begging you.

333
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,332
No, no, no. You do business
with the court as an entity,

334
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,789
- therefore, address the court.
- What?

335
00:19:53,915 --> 00:19:56,207
- What? "Your Honor"!
- Fuck!

336
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,582
You say "Your Honor".

337
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,332
By saying "Your Honor",
you gain the court's attention

338
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,539
and open up a channel
of communication, a conduit.

339
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:05,582
So, we'll try again.

340
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,999
For the benefit of the jury,

341
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,082
on whose behalf were you working
on this side of the river?

342
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,914
- Please, Charlie! I fucking beg of you!
- Order!

343
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,124
Order in this, my court!

344
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,249
Fuck!

345
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,874
You're in Indian country, old son.

346
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,124
That's what them cockneys
call south of the river, innit?

347
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,039
Indian country.

348
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,999
Well, what are you doing
on my reservation without my say-so,

349
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,289
filling up your canteen
from my fucking watering hole?

350
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:42,624
You ain't got the bottle to do that
on your own, son. Who do you work for?

351
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,789
I don't know what you're on about, Charlie.
I don't know what you're on about.

352
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:48,207
- Say their names. Say it!
- Fuck.

353
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,664
- Buzz him.
- Objection, Your Honor.

354
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,664
My client is an upstanding citizen.

355
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,039
Objection overruled
on the grounds it's boring.

356
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:56,249
Oh, well, fuck him.

357
00:20:58,415 --> 00:21:02,249
- Say it. Say "the Krays", you daft cunt.
- Fuck it!

358
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,789
No, no.
No leading the witness, Eddie.

359
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,789
Fuck off!

360
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,789
Alexander might have been great,
but he wasn't a Greek.

361
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,789
- No?
- No. He was a Macedonian.

362
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,874
But he loved them, though,
Aristotle and that lot.

363
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,582
He was deeply impressed
by them flash Hellenistic cunts.

364
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,207
Christos, get us some more
of that awful retsina.

365
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,624
Charlie, we've got to fucking sort this.

366
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,582
You're absolutely right.
Christos, where's my retsina?

367
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,414
<i>The Richardsons
sent George Cornell to call for a truce.</i>

368
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,707
<i>All they were saying
was give peace a chance.</i>

369
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,914
- Fucking Frank'll win.
- What the fuck!

370
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,874
- Are you wearing your bravery jacket?
- We're here to parley.

371
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,332
I will fucking map you up, Southie.

372
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,914
No, no, no. Go on, let him in.
He's only little.

373
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,789
Things have got out of hand.
Charlie wants to meet.

374
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:33,789
Pig and Whistle. Neutral ground.

375
00:22:33,915 --> 00:22:36,374
Just him, you two and Eddie.

376
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,289
Yep. And how do we know
that we're going to be safe?

377
00:22:39,415 --> 00:22:43,999
Well, that's a little thing
called trust, ain't it?

378
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:48,664
Trust? You always got one bloke
harping on about trust, don't you?

379
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,582
But then you look
over your shoulder, right,

380
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,039
and you see there's another bloke there,
right, with his Hampton in his hand

381
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,749
and he's preparing to shove his cock
right up your arse.

382
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,457
Well, you wouldn't mind that.

383
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,957
You fat poof.

384
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,374
No. No, no, no...

385
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,582
Right, you, get him out of here.
Go on, fuck off.

386
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,749
- One hour. We'll be with you.
- That's it, bye-bye.

387
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,457
Fuck off, George.

388
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,414
There's the door, go on.

389
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,539
- Bye-bye.
- Take that dead fox with you. Go on.

390
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:23,624
Get out, you prick.

391
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,332
What a fucking liberty.

392
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,539
Big Charlie, please could I have
another egg?

393
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:30,914
I've eaten this one.

394
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,914
I don't like it, Reggie.

395
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,999
Nah, it's all right.

396
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,539
I know them. I know the pub.

397
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,164
We'll be all right.

398
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,664
You got to clean that fucking toilet, mate.
It stinks.

399
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,499
Mate, I paid a girl to do it.
It's not my fault if she don't.

400
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,124
- What are you having to drink?

401
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,249
Forget it. They just walked in.

402
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,414
- Mate, can I get two Guinnesses, please?
- Hang on a second.

403
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,414
I just gotta go down
to change the barrel.

404
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,082
Reg. Ron.

405
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,207
The Richardsons were
unexpectedly engaged,

406
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,914
so we're going to look after you.

407
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,789
Oh, it's all right. The landlord's gone
to change the barrel for me. Thanks.

408
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:12,999
You don't mind
if I pull myself a pint, do you?

409
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,457
- What is that?
- What do you think, poof?

410
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,789
It's a fucking tool.

411
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:20,539
No, it's not. It's a fucking rolling pin.
Who are you, Fanny Cradock?

412
00:24:20,665 --> 00:24:22,914
What are you gonna do with that?
You gonna bake me a cake?

413
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,539
You gonna sing me a song,
watch me blow out me fucking candles?

414
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,832
I come here
for a fucking shootout, right?

415
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:33,539
A proper shootout
with some proper men,

416
00:24:33,665 --> 00:24:37,124
like Colonel Custer and Geronimo.
Have you ever heard of 'em? No.

417
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,832
Cause you were too busy in your pinny
baking fucking fairy cakes, weren't you?

418
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,749
Reg, this lot are fucking nonces, to a man.
They're fucking nonces.

419
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,457
Get out of me fucking way.
Go on, get out. Go on, fuck off.

420
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,082
Call yourself a fucking gangster?

421
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:54,249
A shootout, right,
is a fucking shootout!

422
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,789
Like a Western.

423
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,457
Wankers! Fucking embarrassing.

424
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:08,874
Waste of my time.
Fucking waste of my time.

425
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,749
Well, your brother's done a runner.

426
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:17,207
He's just genuinely disappointed
with you. That's all.

427
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,039
Look at that. Full of iron, that is.

428
00:25:21,165 --> 00:25:24,789
See, it takes a while, that does,
you know, to settle.

429
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:27,957
Charlie Richardson said we're to knock
the granny out of you, Reg.

430
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:32,289
Oh, yeah? He did, did he?
That's good of him. All right, listen.

431
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:34,914
When you see him next,
you tell him from me, yeah,

432
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,624
that I say... fuck Charlie, right?

433
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,582
And fuck his brother, yeah?

434
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:43,249
And fuck that fat Georgie Cornell
that hangs out with him.

435
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,664
Fuck your face. Yeah, yeah?

436
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:50,332
And fuck the fucking lot of you as well.
What do you think of that?

437
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,874
- You like that?

438
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,957
- You won't mind if I fight back, will you?
- You think you can manage it?

439
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:59,207
It's more for me pride, really,
to be honest.

440
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,124
I warn you,
I'm not gonna fight fair, though.

441
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,789
So I brought these.

442
00:26:02,915 --> 00:26:04,374
All right?

443
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,874
Now, before we start,
I got a little joke for you.

444
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,749
You'll love this one.

445
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,164
Paranoid schizophrenic,
he walks into a bar...

446
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,124
Yeah.

447
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:44,082
You fucking...

448
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,332
Fuck off!

449
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:02,164
<i>They never stood a chance
against my beautiful Reggie.</i>

450
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,539
<i>Gang war seemed certain. '</i>

451
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,832
Fucking hell!

452
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,749
<i>But on the day of the World Cup final,
Scotland Yard had its say as well.</i>

453
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:14,457
<i>There's Ball, running himself daft...</i>

454
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:20,207
Goal! Get in there, you cunts.

455
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,039
Police!

456
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:25,124
- Stay where you are!
- Oh, come on, boys. Not tonight.

457
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,499
What do you mean, no goal?

458
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,914
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

459
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,457
- 'It's a goal!'
- It's a goal! It's a fucking goal! It's a goal!

460
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:42,749
<i>Charlie Richardson
was sentenced to 25 years</i>

461
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:46,289
<i>for fraud, extortion and assault.</i>

462
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:50,249
<i>London was an open city
and the Krays moved in.</i>

463
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,874
Glad you could come, Mr De Faye.

464
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,664
Mr Payne.

465
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:10,124
I'm not often intrigued,
but your message...

466
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,539
- It intrigued.

467
00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:14,289
Sit down.

468
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,164
These are the Kray twins.

469
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,289
Ronald and Reginald.

470
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,624
Yes, I've, heard of them.

471
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,999
You'll find them useful friends.

472
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,207
What's this about, Mr Payne?

473
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:36,124
This is about a gambling casino in
Knightsbridge called Esmeralda's Barn.

474
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,832
- I'm not familiar with it.
- Really?

475
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:39,624
Well, you'll be shocked to learn

476
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,207
that you earned Ł24,000 from it
in the last three months.

477
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:47,082
My friends and I would like
to purchase it from you.

478
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:49,499
We have the contracts ready
for your signature.

479
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,039
<i>Ruling London involved
intelligence and intimidation.</i>

It's not for sale.

You might find that in the future,
there is a less polite approach.

482
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:06,914
<i>The trick was to cultivate
a quiet certainty</i>

483
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,164
<i>that should it be needed,

484
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,332
Yeah.

485
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,082
<i>... and would be happily applied.</i>

486
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,457
<i>Leslie Payne was a fronter and a fixer.</i>

487
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:19,707
<i>Reggie found Payne useful,
but Ron was suspicious of him,</i>

488
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:23,999
<i>afraid his scams were the opposite
of what a gangster should be.</i>

489
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,832
- Consider Las Vegas.
- All right.

490
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:29,539
It's all legal, all run by the Mafia.

491
00:29:29,665 --> 00:29:31,539
Soon, London will be the same.

492
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:33,582
What with Havana gone,
the Mafia is moving in.

493
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:36,289
Meyer Lansky
has already made inquiries.

494
00:29:36,415 --> 00:29:38,789
- Meyer Lansky?
- Yeah.

495
00:29:38,915 --> 00:29:40,749
What, as in the Meyer Lansky?

496
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,374
Meyer Lansky.

497
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,539
Are the Americans gonna try
and muscle in on us?

498
00:29:45,665 --> 00:29:48,874
No. They don't work that way.
They don't want a war, Ron.

499
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,957
- They're businessmen.
- Well, maybe I want a war with them.

500
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,207
Now, look.

501
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,332
What they do want is to know
who is the up-and-coming local firm,

502
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,332
because they will colonize London
by financing that firm,

503
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,957
then franchising the city.

504
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:05,499
So you have to prove to the Americans
that the Krays are the only game in town.

505
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:08,499
Yeah, very fucking interesting.

506
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,999
The world could be our oyster.

507
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,374
- Payne.
- What?

508
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,832
You say "our" a lot, right?

509
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:21,832
You say "our"
and you also say "we" a lot.

510
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,624
Do I?

511
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:27,539
My question is,
is your last name Kray?

512
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:34,374
Listen, Ron, you keep the pearls.
I'm perfectly happy with the soft bits.

513
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,289
Yeah, I bet you are.

514
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,914
I bet you are.

515
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,082
Reggie, I say it's a very bad idea.
It's just a bad idea.

516
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:48,082
I say, right, that we meet these
Mafioso scum at London Airport, right?

517
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,082
We pick them up, we chop them up,

518
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:54,082
put them in their fucking luggage
and send them straight home, mate.

519
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,082
That's the plan.

520
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:08,374
Well, I'm glad
we could have this meeting.

521
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,789
Mr Lansky has taken an interest
in the Colony Sporting Club.

522
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:13,914
He has his casino people there
right now.

523
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,624
Well, Mr Lansky might want to know

524
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,832
that we happen to have
a casino of our own.

525
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:24,289
Really? Your own casino?

526
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:25,832
Well, you see, we own Las Vegas.

527
00:31:28,415 --> 00:31:31,332
But here,
the Atlantic Ocean is in our way.

528
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,414
So Mr Lansky lacks the ability

529
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,789
to, ensure the physical security
of his property,

530
00:31:36,915 --> 00:31:40,582
from both outside muscle and the cops.

531
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:42,289
He thinks the Kray family could help.

532
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:45,749
London is going to be
the Las Vegas of Europe.

533
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:49,624
We need someone to front
and someone to muscle for us.

534
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,749
I mean, look,
we can do your security, right,

535
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:57,539
that's not a problem, you know,
but we don't want to work for you.

536
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,539
I mean, we'd much rather
that we work with you.

537
00:32:00,665 --> 00:32:02,039
What Reggie is trying to say...

538
00:32:02,165 --> 00:32:05,582
I think he knows what he's trying to say.
He just said it.

539
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,707
- We're in your backyard.
- Yeah.

540
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:10,374
And Mr Lansky is open
to discussions of this nature.

541
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,499
He sends this as a goodwill gesture.

542
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:16,289
Just a taste. For expenses.
Open it, please.

543
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:26,874
Now, the second briefcase contains
business of my own I need to take care of.

544
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,539
Please.

545
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:34,457
Bearer bonds. Free money.

546
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,874
A hundred grand
in negotiable bearer bonds.

547
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,664
Jacked from a bank in Montreal.

548
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,539
Too hot to move in North America.

549
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:44,289
That's a hundred grand.

550
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,914
Could you guys handle that?

551
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,789
Yeah, we can handle it.

552
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,914
Really? Good.

553
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,124
Boys who jacked it get 20%.

554
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,207
We split the rest 60-40.

555
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,874
If this works out, Reggie,

556
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,624
I got a $2 million backlog
of those scharoles.

557
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,039
Does that sound
like you're staying out of our way?

558
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,832
50-50, mate.

559
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,124
I like you, Reggie.

560
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,082
50-50 it is. Done.

561
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:25,499
I'm glad we could make a deal.

562
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,789
- Yeah.
- Now, this feels right.

563
00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:30,789
Listen, you come to Philadelphia
any time,

564
00:33:30,915 --> 00:33:34,332
you see what you want, any size,
any shape, right? We'll get it for you.

565
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:37,249
A nice Italian girl.
Little spaghetti and meatballs.

566
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,499
I prefer boys.

567
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,039
Excuse me? I didn't catch that.

568
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,164
I said I prefer boys.

569
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,539
Italians, actually.

570
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,624
Sometimes Greek,
but I am not prejudiced.

571
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,874
No. Because I happen
to have had a Negro once

572
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,499
and a Tahitian,
who I bent up like a pretzel.

573
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:02,082
I really fucking hurt him.

574
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:10,123
You got a lot of fucking balls
to admit that, kid.

575
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:13,498
You know what? You got
some fucking set of castagnas on you.

576
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:16,623
You know what I say to that? Bravo!
Salute! Come on. Salute!

577
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,623
- Salute.
- Am I right, fellas?

578
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,081
- Cheers, mate.
- What fucking balls! Salute!

579
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:23,498
- Cheers, mate.
- Cheers.

580
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:24,706
- Cheers.
- Salute.

581
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:25,998
Marrone.

582
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,081
Cheers, mate.

583
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:35,831
You don't understand!
He's not what you think he is! All right?

584
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:39,581
He's really sweet.
And it's exciting being with him!

585
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:42,748
Just because you have a boring life
doesn't mean I have to as well!

586
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:46,498
The reason I have a boring life
is because I gave up my life for you!

587
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:00,331
Oh, Frankie, you take my breath away.

588
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,664
Well, you can have mine.

589
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:16,789

Stop on the line.

Nothing!

Please, water.

Oh, you want some water?

648
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:50,498
Look at that, gents.
He's only begging for water.

649
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:53,581
What do you make of it now,
your famous Reggie fucking Kray?

650

- Begging for fucking water.

00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,206
What has he come to?

652
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:00,831
Here you are, Reg.

653
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,873

00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:17,081

Reggie! Reggie! Reggie...

661
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,998
Hello, Frances.

662
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:49,748
- Hello, Ron.
- I saw Reg today.

663
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:53,831
He sends his best. He says it's probably
best that you don't go and visit him yet.

664
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,748
Did he say why?

665
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:57,206
Nah, didn't mention it.

666
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,164
Do you know it is possible, right,

667
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:05,831
for a person to become a ghost
while they're still alive.

668
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:08,289
You think so?

669
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,914
Well, it's happened to you, ain't it?

670
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,498
No, no, no. No, look.

671
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:20,831
- Listen.
- "No" what?

672
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,414
No, no, no. Please, please.
Just for a moment, just listen.

673
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:27,623
Gambling clubs are legally obliged
to pay winnings on the spot.

674
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,623
And that is why we insist our gamblers
pay their debts on the spot as well.

675
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,498
Yes, I know. I've heard you.
But that's your problem. Right?

676
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:38,123
That's your problem, not mine.

677
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,039
Mine is that I want Ł50,000.

678
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:44,498
Here you go again
with your Ł50,000 to go to Nigeria.

679
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:47,623
No, it's not just
to go to Nigeria, is it?

680
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,914
I want to set up a company.
All right?

681
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:54,373
I want to build a city in Nigeria,
for the children.

682
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,498
- Near Enugu.
- Enugu.

683
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,998
- Yes, Enugu.
- Yes, Enugu.

684
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,873
I told you, Enugu! Right?

685
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,789
You don't know everything,
do you, Payne?

686
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:06,123
Did you know that "Enugu"
is the African word for "utopia"?

687
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,706
- No.
- No, you did not.

688
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:10,998
Did you know that "utopia"
is the Greek word for "nowhere"?

689
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,206
For Ł50,000,
I can make that somewhere.

690
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:17,248
I can turn it into a place
where people will smile at me

691
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:20,831
- and children will dance...
- I will smile for you, Ron.

692
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:25,664
I will smile for you if you tell me
where I can get Ł50,000.

693
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,581
I'm telling you. I'm fucking telling you.
Just pull it out of the casino.

694
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:32,414
- I cannot pull it out of the casino...
- Just pull it out of the casino, you cunt.

695
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:35,248
Do not meddle with a foolproof way
of making the money!

696
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,998
I'm not a fucking banker!

697
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:40,581
I am not a fucking banker!

698
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:42,498
- Right? Am I?
- Genius! Look at that.

699
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,289
That has made it
all the more manageable.

700
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:47,164
- This man who wants to build a city!
- Don't you fucking threaten me!

701
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:50,206
Don't you fucking dare
talk to me like that, you cunt!

702
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:55,373
Reggie is not here now, all right?
He's fucking gone, ain't he?

703
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,456
So you work for me, Ron Kray!

704
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:01,581
So you will trot along down
to the fucking bank,

705
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,664
and you will fetch me my Ł50,000.

706
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,456
Yeah, I'll go down to the bank
and see what I can do.

707
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:09,706
And I'll tell you what,
I may work for you, Ron,

708
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:13,914
but I'm certainly not afraid of you,
all right?

709
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:17,539
Well, that is fucking stupid as well,
because you fucking should be.

710
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:21,623
Because if my brother hadn't have
vouched for you, you'd be fucking dead.

711
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,123
What happened?

712
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:55,956
What are you doing here?
Didn't Ronnie tell you not to come?

713
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:01,081
- I missed you.
- Look.

714
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:04,081
Frankie, I don't want you to come here
and see me like this, understand?

715
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,831
- Who did it?
- What?

716
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:09,748
Your face.
Was it one of the other prisoners?

717
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:13,539
No, no.
It was one of the guards, all right?

718
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:15,789
- Well, have you reported them?
- No.

719
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:17,623
But you know what?
When I get out, I'm thinking

720
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,706
I might go to the Houses of Parliament,
have a word with the Prime Minister,

721
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,373
'cause he will listen, he will.

722
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,623
Frankie, this is prison, OK?

723
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,206
That's what this is.
It's the law of the jungle in here.

724
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,206
But don't worry about it,
because I'm a big boy,

725
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:33,706
I can look after meself
and I'll be out very soon. All right?

726
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:36,289
Go on, have a look at that lump
over there, you see him?

727
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:37,581
With the big hat.

728
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:41,206
There's a very good reason
why we all call him Handbag.

729
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:44,998
All right?

730
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,914
I don't want a life like this.

731
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:54,623
- Just waiting, while you're in prison.
- I know. I know.

732
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:02,623
- Frankie, it won't happen again.
- How can you be sure?

733
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,914
Because I know. Because I promise you
it won't happen again.

734
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:07,831
All right?

735
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,623
I know how you can be sure.

736
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,498
- Go on.
- You could go straight.

737
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:18,373
Be a casino owner, a club owner.
You enjoy it.

738
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,164
Just forget everything else.

739
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:25,081
It really is that simple for you, innit?
Yeah, just go straight.

740
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:31,289
Babe, life isn't always the way
we want it to be, you know.

741
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:33,248
Life has other plans. It...

742
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,998
- It's the way it is. It's life.
- I love you.

743
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,831
I love you.

744
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:47,289
I never loved anybody before,
but I love you, Reggie.

745
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:51,914
And I love you, too.

746
00:45:58,041 --> 00:45:59,581
You think it can protect people?

747
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,998
What?

748
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,081
Love.

749
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:10,164
I like him. Yeah, he got
something about him, ain't he?

750
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:13,539
Do you know
what I reckon it is? I think it's his hips.

751
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,831
I want to blow the soul
out of that horn.

752
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,289
You feeling a bit horny, are you, Ron?

753
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:24,373
I am. I am.

754
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,206
- Go on. Do it.
- I will. Yeah.

755
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:28,581
I want to blow the soul
out of that horn.

756
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:32,123
That's what I'm gonna do.
OK? OK?

757
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,123
Tiger!

758
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:46,706
That's it, Ron, give it a fucking blow.

759
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:58,123
Kill it.

760
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,623
Oh, fucking hell.

761
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,289
Right.

762
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:12,748
Hello. Hello?

763
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,123
Yes, Ron. Hello.

764
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,414
Do you know when I plan to die?

765
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,956
- When, Ron?
- At the very last minute.

766
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:26,081
Don't fucking encourage him,
for fuck's sake.

767
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:31,081
Look at you, you flash fuckers.

768
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:36,289
Now, I may not be very good, granted.

769
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:38,373
But good gangster?

770
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:42,373
Oh, yeah.
I'll fucking claim that title.

771
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,331
And how many titles
could you claim?

772
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:49,581
Superficialite.

773
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:54,039
Oh, yeah.
Dripping in your synthetic opulence.

774
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:55,789
Ha!

775
00:47:56,666 --> 00:48:00,539
It's disgusting. Really is.
Yeah.

776
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:02,914
Right, a bit of magic.
You love magic, don't you?

777
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:04,748
All kids love magic.

778
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:09,956
You might all be aware
that there are three magic Cs, right,

779
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:11,956
in the word "carpaccio". Yeah?

780
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:15,331
But how many Cs...

781
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,706
...are in the word "cunt"?

782
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:24,748
Just you.

783
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:50,873
You're free.

784
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:54,164
What are you doing
throwing stones at the window?

785
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:55,789
They're not, they're not stones.

786
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:58,206
These are... these are lemon sherbets.
Here you go.

787
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:02,123
Oh, well played.

788
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,664
Why don't you ring the bell?

789
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,123
Well, your mum.

790
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,081
I mean, I'm not being funny,

791
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:11,081
but the thought of your mum answering
that door is a bit shocking, so...

792
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:13,081
I thought she'd give me grief
on account of where I've been.

793
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:17,248
- You mean prison?
- Yeah, prison. You look beautiful.

794
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,498
You look beautiful, too.

795
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,123
I know it's a bit late, right, but...

796
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,748
I've got your Christmas present here.

797
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,664
- Do you want me to throw it up?
- No.

798
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:30,748
What? You want me to deliver it?
I ain't going through that door.

799
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:31,998
All right.

800
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:36,373
You cheeky bugger.

801
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:42,206
Be careful.

802
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:45,498
A bit late now, innit?

803
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:47,331
Right!

804
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:51,248
- Your flowers.
- Thank you.

805
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,706
And...

806
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,623
...your Christmas present.

807
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,498
Sorry it's late.

808
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:03,873
Go on, open it.

809
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:09,623
Frances Shea, will you marry me?

810
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:15,873
We'll live free and above-board?

811
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:19,289
On my honor.

812
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:25,289
Yes, Reggie Kray, I will marry you.

813
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:34,039
That one of mine?

814
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:36,831
Cheeky.

815
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,123
That's it.

816
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,498
Come on,
show us your fucking hoochie.

817
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,623
- Give us a fucking look.
- You're not listening. You're not listening.

818
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,956
All I'm saying, all I'm saying is
crime is still a business.

819
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:58,373
You need a public relations department,
and we've got Joseph Goebbels.

820
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,081
Is he the fat one?

821
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:03,748
You read lips. What's he saying?
What's he saying, Les?

822
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:08,956
I'm struggling, but I think he's saying
something about gobbles or no balls?

823
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,664
That's very strange.

824
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:15,164
He ain't happy. You'll see.

825
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,498
Nice, innit?

826
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:26,873
Oh, he looks lovely, Ron.

827
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,081
He's put on
a little bit of timber, ain't he?

828
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:32,248
He's going to be very, very upset.

829
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:35,039
Did I miss something?

830
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:38,706
Is this not...
This is Friday night, right?

831
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,164
Well, I tried to tell you.

832
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:41,789
Yeah, but it's Friday night, right?

833
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,789
You didn't tell me
that it was this bad, did you?

834
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:46,873
It's Ron, innit?
He's run the place into the ground.

835
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,789
He's turned a straight money earner
into a financial wreck.

836
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:53,789
And another thing: This place will crash
when we get our tax bill next week.

837
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:56,456
What's he saying? What's he saying?

838
00:51:56,583 --> 00:52:00,581
He's just told him that you're missing
tax payments. Silly cunt!

839
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,414
Let's go.

840
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,414
This is tomorrow's business.
Do you understand?

841
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:11,748
That's very rude.

842
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:17,206
- Oi, where are you going?
- It's fucking criminal, mate!

843
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:18,789
Criminal!

844
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,706
Hey, where are you going?

845
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:29,831
Oh, there he is,
my beautiful brother, Reggie.

846
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:32,373
A toast to my beautiful brother.

847
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,748
Home at last,
like Agamemnon returned to Ithaca.

848
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:38,831
And beautiful Frances.

849
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,289
Where have you been?

850
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:43,081
It's as if you've returned
from the dead.

851
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:46,539
What are you doing, mate?
What are you fucking playing at?

852
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:48,248
I'm not playing at anything.
It's you.

853
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:50,498
You come in here.
You don't even say, "Hello, Ron. "

854
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,164
You don't even have a drink.
You just bugger off.

855
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:56,914
- Hello, Ron. Cheers, mate. Fuck you!
- What are you shouting at me for?

856
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:58,914
Because you had the world
on a string, yeah?

857
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:01,164
But you couldn't hold it together
so you fucked it up.

858
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:04,039
- Don't... Listen, you was away.
- I was in prison.

859
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:05,956
I had to make do with what I had.

860
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:08,081
You going Ron or Reg?

861
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:11,956
- Score?

862
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:14,956
Reginald. He'll never go down
in front of the missus.

863
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:18,623
- You had everything, mate. You had it all.
- I didn't have you, did I?

864
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,956
- Reggie, please.
- It's all right, honestly. I got this. It's fine.

865
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:23,914
Yeah, actually, he's got this.
Thank you very much. He's a big boy.

866
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:25,623
We're talking about earning a living.

867
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,373
We're talking about being gangsters,
right, which is what we are.

868
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,873
- So you can just fuck off. Go on.
- Don't.

869
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,414
You know, one of these days, Ron Kray,
your miserable life will swallow you whole.

870
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,914
You should know all about that, because
I've heard all the stories. They're not good.

871
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:42,664
Your mum did palm us off
with the damaged goods, didn't she?

872
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:44,498
You're very, very damaged, aren't you?

873
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:45,914
All right, just get in the car.

874
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:48,706
- Don't ever speak to her like that again.
- Yeah, that's right, Frances.

875
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:52,164
Blood is thicker than water,
and I've been with Reggie since the womb.

876
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:55,373
Ron, shut up. I want you to apologise
to Frances right now.

877
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,164
- Right.
- All right.

878
00:53:57,291 --> 00:54:00,373
Right, right. Frances.

879
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,373
I'm sorry, all right? Yes.

880
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,623
I'm truly very sorry
the club's very, very empty.

881
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:11,373
A bit like you, really. There's fuck-all in it,
apart from my brother's cock.

882
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:32,873
You, all right,
are a fucking disgrace, mate.

883
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,498
You hit me.

884
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:40,498
Yeah.

885
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:47,581
- No! No!
- No, Ron.

886
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:48,914
No! No!

887
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:55,248
I fucking did, you fucking cunt!

888
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:00,581
Fucking cunt!

889
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,706
- Fuck's sake!
- Not the bottle. Not the...

890
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:12,248
No! Not the balls!

891
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,206
My fucking nuts! Wanker!

892
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,373
Sweetheart, please leave.

893
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,248
Biting! Biting cunt!

894
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,373
Give me that.

895
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:44,414
Never mess with a man's jewels, mate.
What the fuck...

896
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:52,164
Now what are you doing?
No, Ron. No. No, no. That's a bottle, Ron.

897
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:55,623
- That's a bottle!
- I'll serve you up, you fucking cunt!

898
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,581
It's a bottle, Ron!

899
00:55:57,708 --> 00:56:00,164
That's enough.

900
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:02,248
Pack it in. That's enough!

901
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,206
- I'm going to split them up.
- Shut up, mate.

902
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:05,748
Get back and sit down in your chair.

903
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:07,998
No. They're family.

904
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:09,873
Stay back.
Get out of the fucking way.

905
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:13,581
Put it down!

906
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:19,123
OK, now, I told you!

907
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,748
Come on, that's enough.

908
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:26,456
No.

909
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,289
No.

910
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,873
Enough, Reg, mate.

911
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,373
You just don't understand,
you don't...

912
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,081
Fuck.

913
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:39,581
You don't understand me.

914
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:43,081
That's probably 'cause I don't want to
fucking understand you right now, Ron.

915
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:44,581
I wanted to just, you know...

916
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:49,206
There's no point in
fucking explaining it to you, either.

917
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:53,289
It's fucking hopeless.
Come on, help me up.

918
00:56:53,416 --> 00:56:55,331
Just help me out here, will you?

919
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:58,039
- That fucking hurt.
- All right, mate. What are you doing?

920
00:56:58,166 --> 00:56:59,539
For fuck's sake, Ron.

921
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:04,248
Reggie, what I'm trying to tell you
is very simple, all right?

922
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:05,789
Listen.

923
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:12,123
I am very, very, very fragile,
myself.

924
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,373
All right?

925
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,373
Yeah, fragile, I've got it.

926
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,081
- Very fragile.
- I've got it.

927
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:28,581
All right, come on, now.
For fuck's sake.

928
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:31,331
I'm not myself, am I?

929
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:33,664
I mean, this isn't me. Is it?

930
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:36,581
This isn't us.
None of this is us, is it?

931
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:41,206
- I'm very sorry.
- It's OK.

932
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:42,998
Are you done?

933
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,498
Has she gone?

934
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:48,581
- Yes, she's gone, mate.
- She's a keeper.

935
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:50,789
She is. Thank you, Ron.
Thanks.

936
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:05,414
- There she is.
- Yeah, I got her.

937
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:07,414
All right, stop here.

938
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,581
That girl's gonna be the death of me.

939
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:12,039
Mind how you go.

940
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:15,331
Frankie. Frank.
Excuse me. Sorry.

941
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,956
I need to have a word with you
about something.

942
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:19,539
I don't care if you forget me.

943
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,414
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

944
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:22,581
You don't mean it.

945
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,498
Don't tell me what I mean.
I know what I mean.

946
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:26,831
Come on, Frances, please.
Can't we just start again?

947
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:28,414
From the beginning, you know.

948
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:32,164
We can get rid of everything that's bad,
and we'll just keep everything that's good.

949
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:36,039
- What about Ron?
- What about Ron?

950
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:38,081
He's not exactly a good bit, is he?

951
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:41,123
Well... I mean,
he's not exactly a bad bit, either.

952
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,789
- He was awful to me.
- Yeah, he was. But, you know, that...

953
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:49,206
That's Ron. If he don't take his tablets,
he's like that. He's a nightmare.

954
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,706
He's not always like that, you know.
He's got a heart of gold.

955
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,539
He loves you to bits.
He thinks the world of you.

956
00:58:54,666 --> 00:58:56,289
Honestly, when you left,
he was in pieces.

957
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:58,789
He was like, "Where's she gone?"
I said, "She's left. "

958
00:58:58,916 --> 00:59:01,164
"Well, you better get after her
'cause she's a keeper. "

959
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,289
You are a keeper. So he's right.

960
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,206
He said, "Tell her I'm very sorry. "

961
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:09,164
He is sorry and I'm sorry.
We're all sorry. But you know, that...

962
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:11,873
That's what happens sometimes.
Families are stupid, aren't they?

963
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,289
You know, they fight,
you know, they make up.

964
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:17,956
And ultimately, you know, they stick
together 'cause they love each other.

965
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:19,789
It's what they do.

966
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:24,581
Don't tell me about forgetting you,
'cause that ain't happening, either.

967
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,873
I spent the last six months
thinking about nothing but you.

968
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,998
- So I get out and the club's gone up...
- All right. All right.

969
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:33,039
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

970

I regret that my answer is no.

979

Nigeria is simply too far away

980
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:15,248

981
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,414
I'm so sorry.

01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:34,414
And don't spare the horses.

987

01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:19,581
Yeah?

1002
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:22,498
Fucking look at me, you cunt.

1003
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:24,789
Yeah?

1004
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:28,039
Go on, fucking look at him now.

1005
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:30,081
Fucking look at me.

1006
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:33,998
But he looks up at me!

1007
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:39,873
Good Lord,
that's Bob Boothby.

1008
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,664
Yes, Prime Minister, sir.

1009
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:43,998
At an orgy.

1010
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:46,873
The Tories are going to have trouble
explaining this.

1011
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:51,456
Here, sir.

1012
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:55,373
Is that Tom Driberg?

1013
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,914
In fact, yes, sir.

1014
01:01:57,041 --> 01:02:00,831
There's no moral advantage to my party
if my party are also involved.

1015
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:02,831
It gets a bit stickier, sir.

1016
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:05,748
- Where were these photos taken?
- Cazenove Road, Hackney.

1017
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:08,414
What in God's boots
were they doing in Hackney?

1018
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:09,581
That's where it gets sticky.

1019
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:12,248
I thought the orgy was the sticky bit.
It gets stickier still?

1020
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:16,206
We've had two brothers, gangsters,
under surveillance. The Krays.

1021
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:20,539
The photographs
were taken in Ronald Kray's flat.

1022
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:24,664
Orgies aside, we're tracking fraud,
protection rackets

1023
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:27,914
and the American Mafia
might also be involved.

1026
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:34,998
The elections are in 10 weeks.

1027
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:37,123
They'll vote out
both sides of the House.

1028
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,748
What exactly are you doing about it?

1029
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:41,248
Bugger all, by the looks of it.

1030
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:46,331
Is that Italian?

1031
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:49,081
- Don't know.
- Is it a Daimler?

1032
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:52,289
It's nice, that is.

1033
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:54,414
Oh, what do you want for Christmas?

1034
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:56,998
I don't know.

1035
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:58,873
- You don't have to get me anything.

1036
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,664
- You don't have to get me a present.
- That's ridiculous.

1037
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:03,331
Not get you anything for Christmas?

1038
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:05,789
All right, well, just surprise me, then.
Surprise me.

1039
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:08,289
I'll get you a sock full of coal,
you lucky thing.

1040
01:03:08,416 --> 01:03:10,248
What about that?

1041
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:11,748
What about it?

1042
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:13,748
For Christmas.

1043
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:15,331

1044

- Is it?
- Yeah.

1047

That's our ticket out of here.

01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:34,289
Yeah.

the police stitched me up.

- I am innocent. I'm completely...
- Even if you are...

1077
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:56,289
- What?
- You're back in prison.

1078
01:04:57,541 --> 01:04:58,789

I'm fucking innocent!

- I boxed as a lad, like you.

Yeah.

1124
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:30,832
It did turn you into handing your own
over at the bar, didn't it?

You know, the difference
between us, right,

01:11:43,957 --> 01:11:46,539
So, just take it easy. Deep breaths.

01:13:10,541 --> 01:13:13,623
accept our prayers
for Frances and Reginald,

1168
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:16,789
that they may reap
the harvest of the spirit

1169
01:13:16,916 --> 01:13:20,789
and reflect your glory
through Christ Jesus, our Lord.

1170
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:23,248
- Amen.
- Amen.

1171
01:13:44,541 --> 01:13:46,498
Fucking sing!

1172
01:13:58,457 --> 01:14:00,707
<i>'We honeymooned in Greece.</i>

1173
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:04,664
<i>'The Parthenon
had stood for 2,400 years.</i>

1174
01:14:04,791 --> 01:14:08,207
<i>'Reggie's promise to go straight
lasted two weeks. '</i>

1175
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:11,789
The Two Aces,

1176
01:14:11,916 --> 01:14:13,832
the New Mill,

1177
01:14:13,957 --> 01:14:15,414
the Gigi Club

1178
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:17,289
and let's not forget Ronnie Scott's.

1179
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:20,914
And this is the bearer bonds
cashed in Hamburg!

1180
01:14:24,207 --> 01:14:26,498
Kettle's on the boil.

1181
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:28,414
It's tea.

1182
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:31,623
<i>'We started out
near Marble Arch in West London.</i>

1183
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,873
<i>'But we both missed the East End.</i>

1184
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,332

to be temporary. Not very clever. '</i>

Rattle it, monkey boy!

1187
01:14:44,166 --> 01:14:46,123
<i>'Ron's parties would
keep me awake at night</i>

1188
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:49,164

<i>'He enjoyed being a gangster,
after all. '</i>

1190
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:55,039
We heard that you were
down the Regency the other night.

1191
01:14:57,957 --> 01:14:59,539
Waving a shotgun.

1192
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:05,748
Those bastard Barry brothers
blocked me from coming in.

1193
01:15:06,707 --> 01:15:08,207
They said I was drunk.

1194
01:15:08,332 --> 01:15:10,873
You were.
You was drunk as a skunk.

1195
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,414
Waving a shotgun?

1196
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:17,664
No.

1197
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:22,957
Now, you know
we look after that place, right?

1198
01:15:23,082 --> 01:15:26,248
So, no more of your
messing around down there.

1199
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:29,873
I spiced the evening up for people.

1200
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,332
"Spiced it up".

1201
01:15:32,457 --> 01:15:33,707
Here you go.

1202
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:47,123
Now, you're not gonna do that
anymore, are you?

1203
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,039
No, sir.

1204
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:50,664
Good lad.

1205
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:54,789
Oh, bollocks.

1206
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:56,414
Get up, Jack, fuck off.

1207
01:15:56,541 --> 01:15:58,998
This is so kind of you.

1208
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:01,332
- Treat, isn't it?
- Lovely, yeah.

1209
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:02,498
Oh, hello.

1210
01:16:05,957 --> 01:16:07,914
Oh...

1211
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,623
- Is that OK?
- No, no.

1212
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:15,498
No, Frances. That won't...
That won't do.

1213
01:16:17,707 --> 01:16:20,414
Go and sit with Mr Kray
and I'll sort it out.

1214
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:22,373
All right.

1215
01:16:29,082 --> 01:16:32,623
She can't even make
a decent cup of tea.

1216
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,707
Poor Reggie?

1217
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:37,789
It was a good effort.

1218
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:42,207
She looks like a budgie
in that dress, doesn't she?

1219
01:16:42,332 --> 01:16:45,748
The rag-and-bone man wouldn't
pick her up if she was laying in the gutter.

1220
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,748
Really.

1221
01:16:48,832 --> 01:16:50,414
Oh, well.
Poor Reggie.

1222
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:53,248
Right, I shall,
Might as well flush that.

1223
01:16:55,707 --> 01:16:58,039

1229

01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,582
Don't go too fast.

1239
01:17:44,707 --> 01:17:48,123
We're not going anywhere like too fast.
We're on the grass.

1240
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:50,664
- All right. Almost there.
- All right.

1241
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,414
- Bit more.
- OK.

1242
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:53,832
OK.

1243
01:17:53,957 --> 01:17:55,248
- You ready?
- Yes.

1244
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:56,789
- Ready ready?
- Yes.

1245
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:01,123
Oh, my God!

1246
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:04,998
- Do you like it?
- Yes, what kind is it? What's it called?

1247
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:07,957
- It's a Triumph, a Triumph Spitfire.
- Can I get in?

1248
01:18:08,082 --> 01:18:11,539
Yeah, of course you can, it's yours.
Happy birthday. There you are.

1249
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:15,582
- Happy birthday, Frances.
- Thank you.

1250
01:18:15,707 --> 01:18:17,789
Will you teach me how to drive?

1251
01:18:17,916 --> 01:18:20,582
I can.

1252
01:18:20,707 --> 01:18:24,039
- Now?
- Oh, not today.

1253
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:29,289
- Why not?
- I just... I can't. Not today.

1254
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:32,457
But I can tomorrow.

1255
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:36,414
- All right.
- Sorry.

1256
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:47,164
Kray.

1257
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:49,207
- Kray.
- Kray.

1258
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:54,039
There's an inherent threat
in that one commanding syllable.

1259
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:56,707
It's the only word some need to hear.

1260
01:18:57,541 --> 01:18:59,539
What does that mean, "the only word"?

1261
01:19:00,166 --> 01:19:02,164
Well, you're like Ford.

1262
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:05,957
Or Shell.
Or Woolworth's.

1263
01:19:06,082 --> 01:19:07,498
Woolworth's.

1264
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:10,414
Yeah, that's very interesting.

1265
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:14,039
All I'm saying is Kray is a brand

1266
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:18,914
and an established reputation needs less
maintenance, less violence, you know?

1267
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:20,748
People fall naturally into line.

1268
01:19:20,875 --> 01:19:23,332
Clubs are asking for our protection
before we even offer it.

1269
01:19:23,457 --> 01:19:26,414
Yeah. That's true, actually,
they are. Yes.

1270
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:29,582
I suppose that would leave us
with less straightening out to do.

1271
01:19:29,707 --> 01:19:31,748
- Exactly. That's right.
- Yeah.

1272
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:34,332
Makes sense.

1273
01:19:34,457 --> 01:19:36,664
But I happen to like...

1274
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:39,207
I like straightening out,
you know, once in a while.

1275
01:19:39,332 --> 01:19:41,498
Obliging someone in the old cobbles.

1276
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:42,873
What's wrong with that?

1277
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,498
I just think you could do better, Ron.
You know.

1278
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:49,539
It'll keep you out of prison, I mean,
none of us are getting any younger.

1279
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:52,039
You know, you need to leave
all this behind, I mean...

1280
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:55,082
You got to look to the future,
you and that lovely young wife of yours.

1281
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:57,039
No! Fairy tales!

1282
01:19:57,166 --> 01:19:58,748
That's fucking warning!

1283
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:02,498
This is a firm, right?
I'm a fucking face.

1284
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:05,373
I'll fucking serve you up,
you fucking cunt!

1285
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,207
You're fucking bang out of order!

1286
01:20:08,332 --> 01:20:11,414
I don't fucking like him, I don't trust him.
He asks too many questions.

1287
01:20:11,541 --> 01:20:14,582
- I want him fucking dead!
- Leslie Payne, right, is our business,

1288
01:20:14,707 --> 01:20:16,082
and you want him dead.

1289
01:20:16,207 --> 01:20:19,289
- Have you been taking your tablets?
- Fuck tablets, right? Bugger tablets!

1290
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:22,082
Bugger Payne,
the fucking pain in the arse!

1291
01:20:22,207 --> 01:20:23,414
And fuck his briefcase!

1292
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:27,082
I don't give a fuck what's in there,
I want to know what's going on up there.

1293
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:35,373
He knows too much about things.
Things about us.

1294
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,623
Reggie, he knows
too many things about us.

1295
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,707
He knows too many things about us?
Right.

1296
01:20:39,832 --> 01:20:42,082
Albie,
do you know things about us, mate?

1297
01:20:42,207 --> 01:20:43,789
Do you know things?

1298
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:46,414
About Ron, about me,
about the firm, right?

1299
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:48,414
You know about payments, right?

1300
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:50,123
You know we cash bearer bonds, yeah?

1301
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:53,664
D'you know we pay off juries to make 'em
look fucking favorably upon us, do you?

1302
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:54,998
Yes.

1303
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:56,873
You do. There's a fucking surprise.
Jack!

1304
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,707
Mate, do you know anything
about fraud?

1305
01:20:58,832 --> 01:21:00,373
Anything at all? Take a punt.

1306
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,582
Do you know anything about
how we pay off policemen

1307
01:21:02,707 --> 01:21:05,332
every fucking
final Thursday of the month?

1308
01:21:05,457 --> 01:21:07,498
- Do you know that?
- Of course I do.

1309
01:21:07,625 --> 01:21:10,207
Fucking surprise, that.
So why don't we kill Jack now?

1310
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:12,539
Or we do Albie as well?
We do the fucking lot.

1311
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:16,207
Or you can do me and I'll do you
and we're both fucking dead!

1312
01:21:16,332 --> 01:21:17,707
That's a genius idea!

1313
01:21:17,832 --> 01:21:20,664
Listen to yourself, Ron!
You're fucking nuts!

1314
01:21:25,541 --> 01:21:30,289
People who live in glass houses
shouldn't throw stones.

1315
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:35,582
You know
I never drank gin till I came here?

1316
01:21:35,707 --> 01:21:38,248
Oh, well, next you'll be singing
God Save the Queen, won't you?

1317
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,998
What did you want to have
a word with me about, Mr Bruno?

1318
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:45,957
Things are going well,
we're very happy on my side of the pond.

1319
01:21:46,082 --> 01:21:48,789
Well, that's good.
You know, we're very happy also.

1320
01:21:49,707 --> 01:21:51,248
OK.

1321
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:54,748
Cheers.

1322
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:58,457
You realize I asked
to speak to you alone.

1323
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:03,039
You see, in our line of work,

1324
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:04,914
it's not good to be famous.

1325
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:08,332
Anonymous is the goal.

1326
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:11,832
This Mr Lansky, Reg,

1327
01:22:11,957 --> 01:22:14,289
he sees a lot of potential in you.

1328
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:17,289
But he sees limitations
in your brother Ron.

1329
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:18,957
Well, you know, maybe...

1330
01:22:19,082 --> 01:22:21,998
Maybe they could just sit down
and meet each other, couldn't they?

1331
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:23,832
I mean,
he could come across for a chat.

1332
01:22:23,957 --> 01:22:25,707
A chat?

1333
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,498
You guys crack me up, really.

1334
01:22:29,957 --> 01:22:31,414
You ever hear of the Gallo brothers?

1335
01:22:31,541 --> 01:22:32,998
- From Brooklyn?
- No.

1336
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,707
Similar loose cannon situation.

1337
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,873
You see, Ron is your Joey.

1338
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:40,998
And it's not gonna end well
in either case.

1339
01:22:45,707 --> 01:22:48,414
What exactly are you
asking me to do, Mr Bruno?

1340
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:51,832
I'm asking you
to do something about Ron.

1341
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,623
I can't do that.

1342
01:22:58,041 --> 01:22:59,914
He's my brother.

1343
01:23:01,916 --> 01:23:03,289
OK.

1344
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:50,207
- There's nothing I can do.
- I ain't finished with you yet.

1345
01:23:50,332 --> 01:23:54,373
- Mr Kray takes care of this warehouse.
- Now, you say Kray one more time...

1346
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:57,914
...and I'm gonna hit you, you understand?

1347
01:23:58,041 --> 01:23:59,414
I have an arrangement with Mr Kray.

1348
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:01,582
I didn't ask whether we had
an arrangement.

1349
01:24:01,707 --> 01:24:04,582
I asked if you understood me.

1350
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:06,707
<i>'The Richardson gang were away.</i>

1351
01:24:06,832 --> 01:24:11,789
<i>'But George Cornell had crossed the river
to work a protection racket on their behalf. '</i>

1352
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:14,414
I fucking warned you!

1353
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:17,998
<i>'Ron's response would secure
his place in gangster legend. '</i>

1354
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:19,914
What is that,
is that English breakfast tea?

1355
01:24:20,041 --> 01:24:22,082
I can tell by your face, Ted,
what you think of it.

1356
01:24:22,207 --> 01:24:25,957
- Lovely box, isn't it? It's beautiful.
- It's not English breakfast. That's not, no.

1357
01:24:26,082 --> 01:24:28,789
That's got pheromones in it, that's got.

1358
01:24:29,791 --> 01:24:31,373
It's musky.

1359
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,957
That's a bit of magic, that is.

1360
01:24:34,791 --> 01:24:36,664
That's very beautiful, innit?

1361
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:39,707
- I'm glad you like it.
- I do, that's proper.

1362
01:24:39,832 --> 01:24:42,539
Me mum will be very,
very pleased with that.

1363
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:44,832
Did you have that away
from the old warehouse, did you?

1364
01:24:44,957 --> 01:24:47,332
- Yeah.
- Don't say anything. It's all right.

1365
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:49,789
- Regards to Mrs Kray.
- Thank you.

1366
01:24:49,916 --> 01:24:53,164
- For the other matter.
- Yeah. What matter?

1367
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:03,832
That?

1368
01:25:03,957 --> 01:25:05,998
- Yeah.
- All right.

1369
01:25:07,291 --> 01:25:10,373
I mean, I'm not in the mind
to hand out refunds, am I?

1370
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:15,998
Can't you handle it yourself?

1371
01:25:17,207 --> 01:25:19,373
I pay you for protection, Ron.

1372
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:25,832
- What are you trying to say?
- Nothing...

1373
01:25:25,957 --> 01:25:28,582
No, you just said it.
You just fucking said it.

1374
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:31,539
You come in here
with your fucking nose, right,

1375
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:33,873
and your tea.

1376
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,957
Your fucking exotic tea.

1377
01:25:36,082 --> 01:25:37,164
Right?

1378
01:25:37,291 --> 01:25:39,164
And you say that.

1379
01:25:39,291 --> 01:25:41,539
I'm not very good at my job.

1380
01:25:41,666 --> 01:25:44,207
- I didn't mean it like that.
- You fucking did!

1381
01:25:45,457 --> 01:25:47,082
- No, I...

1382
01:25:47,207 --> 01:25:48,539
I'll tell you what.

1383
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:51,664
This matter of yours...

1384
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:55,248
- I'll deal with it for you. All right?
- All right.

1385
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:57,332
You go with Teddy, right,

1386
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,789
and you bring me Ł2,000, OK?

1387
01:26:01,541 --> 01:26:06,623
And in return, I promise
that I will have George Cornell killed.

1388
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:09,248
All right?

1389
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:11,248
- I didn't say...
- All right?

1390
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,748
I didn't say
anything about killing, Ron.

1391
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:16,164
You fucking did.

1392
01:26:16,291 --> 01:26:18,914
You fucking meant it.
Look at you, you meant it with your eyes.

1393
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:22,582
Look at your eyes.
It's in your fucking eyes!

1394
01:26:22,707 --> 01:26:24,664
- Or are you threatening me?
- No.

1395
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:27,332
'Cause there's death in your eyes
and you're fucking threatening me!

1396
01:26:27,457 --> 01:26:29,207
- Is he threatening me?
- It's hard to tell, Ron.

1397
01:26:29,332 --> 01:26:30,414
- I'll pay.
- You'll what?

1398
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:31,623
- I'll pay.
- You will?

1399
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:34,373
- Yeah.
- There it is. And a deal is a deal.

1400
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,789
- It's done.
- Yeah.

1401
01:26:35,916 --> 01:26:38,539
It's done. It's over.
Teddy, take him.

1402
01:26:39,832 --> 01:26:41,039
Thank you.

1403
01:26:41,166 --> 01:26:43,539
- That's very kind of you.
- Thank you.

1404
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:45,414
For the tea.

1405
01:26:48,332 --> 01:26:49,957
That's a good deal.

1406
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:12,582
How do I look?

1407
01:27:13,291 --> 01:27:14,957
Fucking deadly.

1408
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:19,248
- Do you want me to come in with you?

1409
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:20,539
In there?

1410
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:24,498
Come on.

1411
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:27,039
You all stay in the car.

1412
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:31,248
Anything you need to tell me?

1413
01:27:38,707 --> 01:27:40,498
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

1414
01:27:41,457 --> 01:27:43,373
Jesus!

1415
01:27:46,875 --> 01:27:48,914
Yeah, you're not laughing now, are you?

1416
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:51,998
For fuck's sake.

1417
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:55,039
Boss, the fuck...

1418
01:27:58,582 --> 01:28:00,414
Get the fuck down!

1419
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:02,289
Don't say a fucking word!

1420
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:04,248
What are you fucking looking at?

1421
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:05,789
You didn't see nothing!

1422
01:28:08,125 --> 01:28:10,207
Fuck.

1423
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:13,707
That's Ronnie Kray, that, isn't it?

1424
01:28:13,832 --> 01:28:15,207
Fucking hell.

1425
01:28:29,457 --> 01:28:30,498
Reggie.

1426
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:32,957
Are you mad?

1427
01:28:35,416 --> 01:28:38,332
The Blind Beggar? Yeah, Cornell?

1428
01:28:38,457 --> 01:28:39,707
It's on the fucking radio.

1429
01:28:39,832 --> 01:28:41,664
Reggie.

1430
01:28:42,582 --> 01:28:43,664
Hi, Mum.

1431
01:28:45,707 --> 01:28:47,664
Oh. Thank you.

1432
01:28:47,791 --> 01:28:50,707
Oh! Look at you.

1433
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:54,373
Look how handsome you are!

1434
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:58,914
- I'll get you a cup of tea.
- Thanks, Mum.

1435
01:28:59,041 --> 01:29:01,414
- Albie?
- I'm all right, Violet, thank you.

1436
01:29:07,582 --> 01:29:09,664
You do look lovely, Reggie.

1437
01:29:11,457 --> 01:29:12,707
How many witnesses?

1438
01:29:12,832 --> 01:29:15,039
It was a quiet night.

1439
01:29:15,166 --> 01:29:17,082
- Seven?
- Seven?

1440
01:29:17,207 --> 01:29:21,082
Albert Woods was with Cornell.
Plus five regulars, don't know them.

1441
01:29:21,207 --> 01:29:24,457
And the barmaid, the blond, the one
with the big fucking pair of eyes.

1442
01:29:24,582 --> 01:29:25,957
For fuck's sake.

1443
01:29:26,082 --> 01:29:28,457
And you bring this here?
You bring it straight to Mum's?

1444
01:29:28,582 --> 01:29:31,082
Don't moan about it, all right?
It's done, innit?

1445
01:29:31,207 --> 01:29:33,623
What are we gonna do?

1446
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,707
- "We"?
- Yeah.

1447
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,414
Where's the weapon?

1448
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:45,414
It's here, Reg.

1449
01:29:47,957 --> 01:29:50,332
There you go. Now...

1450
01:29:50,457 --> 01:29:52,789
- Here, let me have it.
- Would you like a piece of cake?

1451
01:29:52,916 --> 01:29:55,539
Do you know what? That would be lovely.
Yeah. Thank you, Mum.

1452
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:58,873
- It is, it's lovely.
- Thanks.

1453
01:30:01,082 --> 01:30:03,164
I assume you were
in those clothes, right?

1454
01:30:03,291 --> 01:30:05,623
Yeah, yeah.

1455
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,414
So where's his jacket?

1456
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:08,748
Right, you need to burn that.

1457
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:11,373
And that gun, we need to toss it
in the river right fucking now.

1458
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,082
Go on, fuck off.

1459
01:30:18,457 --> 01:30:20,789
You are...
You're unbelievable.

1460
01:30:22,041 --> 01:30:23,457
Albie?

1461
01:30:23,582 --> 01:30:26,164
Whoever was in that pub,
we need to find out who they are,

1462
01:30:26,291 --> 01:30:29,414
get hold of them and just unravel
whatever they've said to the police.

1463
01:30:29,541 --> 01:30:32,207
We need to undo, so get Big Pat,
Bender, send them down there now.

1464
01:30:32,332 --> 01:30:33,873
- The barmaid I know, right?
- You know her.

1465
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,373
Well, bring her to me,
I'll deal with her myself, all right?

1466
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,539
Go on. Fuck off.

1467
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:39,832
Oh.

1468
01:30:39,957 --> 01:30:41,789
Where's everybody gone?

1469
01:30:42,332 --> 01:30:45,164
Oh, Mum, it's late, it's late.
I wanted them out of your hair, you know.

1470
01:30:45,291 --> 01:30:47,414
You should get some bed time.

1471
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:49,289
Why don't I give you a lift home?
Come on.

1472
01:30:50,041 --> 01:30:52,707
Oh, it's all right, I am home.

1473
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:56,207
I've made a bed up for him.
He's not well.

1474
01:30:56,332 --> 01:30:58,123
He's...

1475
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:59,873
He's got a fever.

1476
01:31:00,916 --> 01:31:03,082
He's going to stay here the night.

1477
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,248
Teddy, would you like to stay with him?

1478
01:31:09,791 --> 01:31:12,789
Thank you, that'd be very nice.
Thank you, Violet.

1479
01:31:19,166 --> 01:31:21,289
Whatever he's done,

1480
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:24,082
he's your brother.

1481
01:31:26,582 --> 01:31:35,373
Yeah.

1482
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:37,914
Well...

1483
01:31:40,332 --> 01:31:42,289
Here's your Stemetil, mate.

1484
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:44,998
You should take that.

1485
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:50,082
Do you know what?
I'm going to have to go, actually.

1486
01:31:50,207 --> 01:31:54,414
'Cause, I left the lads at work
and I have to clean up.

1487
01:31:55,832 --> 01:31:57,664
So, I'm going to say goodnight.

1488
01:31:57,791 --> 01:31:58,832
Goodnight.

1489
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:05,789
Teddy, now, you couldn't do us a favor,
could you? Be useful.

1490
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:09,873
And when you take his trousers off tonight
and his shirt, can you burn them?

1491
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,707
Yeah? And check in with me.

1492
01:32:11,832 --> 01:32:13,664
- Yeah.
- Good lad.

1493
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:16,457
Night-night.
Goodnight.

1494
01:32:16,582 --> 01:32:17,707
Goodnight, Reggie.

1495
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:25,539
He's lovely, isn't he?

1496
01:32:31,332 --> 01:32:34,707
<i>'Not even Scotland Yard
could ignore murder on the streets.</i>

1497
01:32:34,832 --> 01:32:36,914
<i>'Nipper was back on the case. '</i>

1498
01:32:37,041 --> 01:32:39,164
Gentlemen, your attention, please.

1499
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:44,332
Now, you've been told that we're
conducting a high-level investigation

1500
01:32:44,457 --> 01:32:46,789
into a major corruption allegation.

1501
01:32:46,916 --> 01:32:53,164
In fact, we're going down into the sewer
after the Krays.

1502
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,457
Any man with any objection,
come and see me.

1503
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:05,373
See that lamppost up there, right?

1504
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:08,332
That was known as a safety point
during the war, right?

1505
01:33:08,457 --> 01:33:10,039
So, if you could run to that lamppost,

1506
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:12,414
you knew that you could make it
to the air raid shelter

1507
01:33:12,541 --> 01:33:14,457
before the bombs started dropping.

1508
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,082
One night, right, me and Ron,
we just stood there and we watched.

1509
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,123
We saw the old Stanton house
get blown to bits, they were still in it.

1510
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:27,123
It's a wonder you lived through it.

1511
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:29,914
Yeah, yeah,
especially with Ron, you know.

1512
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:33,664
Every time trouble came on top, he was
always dragging behind, wasn't he?

1513
01:33:33,791 --> 01:33:36,664
He's got plenty of trouble now,
if the stories are true.

1514
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:40,457
I heard it on the street, Reggie.

1515
01:33:41,125 --> 01:33:43,082
My own family and you didn't tell me.

1516
01:33:43,207 --> 01:33:45,914
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want you to worry, did I?

1517
01:33:46,041 --> 01:33:47,623
I don't worry about Ron.

1518
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:50,207
- What do you plan to do about it?
- I'm not gonna let him go to prison.

1519
01:33:50,332 --> 01:33:51,998
- Why not?
- Why not?

1520
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:55,414
Why not? Because he's my brother,
that's why not.

1521
01:33:55,541 --> 01:33:57,123
He'll still be your brother in prison.

1522
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:58,873
No.

1523
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,789
No, Frances, look, he belongs here, right?
He belongs with us.

1524
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:04,957
He belongs with you, me and his family,
this is his home, all right?

1525
01:34:05,082 --> 01:34:08,457
I've been looking after Ron since we were
little boys, it's just the way it is.

1526
01:34:08,582 --> 01:34:10,998
You can still look after him in prison.

1527
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:13,582
And he doesn't belong here
and you know it.

1528
01:34:14,707 --> 01:34:16,248
Right.

1529
01:34:17,541 --> 01:34:19,789
Right, well, you just don't understand.

1530
01:34:19,916 --> 01:34:21,248
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

1531
01:34:21,375 --> 01:34:24,248
Yes, I do. You once told me
you don't owe the world a thing.

1532
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:26,582
Well, you don't owe Ron a thing, either.

1533
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:30,832
My loyalty for my brother is how
I measure myself, do you understand?

1534
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:33,332
What about your loyalty to me,
is that not a measure?

1535
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:37,914
So... what is going on
with your eyes right now?

1536
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:41,248
Are you on something?
Are you taking something, Frances?

1537
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:43,789
Are you taking pills again?
Let's have a look.

1538
01:34:43,916 --> 01:34:45,373
- Oh, hello. Look at that.
- Stop it.

1539
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,832
Jesus Christ, how many
of these things are you on?

1540
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:51,248
No wonder you're not making any sense.
You're a pill popper.

1541
01:34:51,375 --> 01:34:53,289
- And who made me that?
- What? A pill popper?

1542
01:34:55,666 --> 01:34:57,748
So, let me get this straight.
What you're saying is that

1543
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:59,832
in order for us all to be free, yeah,

1544
01:34:59,957 --> 01:35:02,164
that we all have to be on our own?

1545
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:06,414
That's great, Frances.
Let's just... I'll go with that.

1546
01:35:06,541 --> 01:35:09,582
- Listen, talk to that barmaid.
- Yeah?

1547
01:35:09,707 --> 01:35:11,873
Tell her when they line the suspects up
across from her

1548
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,248
to point her finger at Ron
and say, "That's him.

1549
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,248
"That's the mad hatter what done it. "

1550
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:17,957
All right?

1551
01:35:19,041 --> 01:35:21,414
- Where are you going?
- Home.

1552
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,582
- What about me mum?
- Fuck your mum!

1553
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:52,707
- Take your time.
- No.

1554
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:55,539
The man who shot Cornell,
he's not here.

1555
01:35:56,457 --> 01:35:57,873
Are you sure?

1556
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,248
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sure.

1557
01:36:01,207 --> 01:36:03,539
Please, could someone
just take me home?

1558
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:16,289
Miss.

1559
01:36:20,207 --> 01:36:21,998
I swear to God.

1560
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:24,748
I smelt something,
I don't know what I smelt.

1561
01:36:24,875 --> 01:36:27,414
There were some good funny looks
in the room towards the judge.

1562
01:36:28,582 --> 01:36:31,207
A bit stinky, he was.

1563
01:36:31,332 --> 01:36:33,748
Right?
Am I right or am I wrong?

1564
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,664
- No. No.

1565
01:36:35,791 --> 01:36:37,957
Just goes to show,
you can give a dog a bad name,

1566
01:36:38,082 --> 01:36:40,457
but when that dog's name is Kray,
it might bite you back. Well done.

1567
01:36:40,582 --> 01:36:42,373
Well done, Ronnie.
Justice is served.

1568
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:45,164
- Mea culpa. Mea culpa.
- Drink to my little bunny.

1569
01:36:45,291 --> 01:36:46,623
Welcome home.

1570
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:48,248
Maxima.

1571
01:36:48,791 --> 01:36:49,832
It's discipline.

1572
01:36:49,957 --> 01:36:52,414
Come and sit down, Vi.
No.

1573
01:36:52,541 --> 01:36:55,457
Give her a pink wafer.

1574
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,289
What did you tell her?

1575
01:37:20,166 --> 01:37:23,914
I just said, "You might want to think
about your children. " You know?

1576
01:37:26,957 --> 01:37:29,164
I wish I could make you go away.

1577
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:31,998
Well, good luck with that, Frances.

1578
01:37:32,125 --> 01:37:34,207
Yeah. Good fucking luck with that.

1579
01:38:20,082 --> 01:38:21,707
It's pouring down with rain.

1580
01:38:23,082 --> 01:38:24,957
What the fuck is she doing?

1581
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:31,373
It surprises me
that some people still...

1582
01:38:32,582 --> 01:38:34,707
Still survive these days.

1583
01:38:34,832 --> 01:38:36,582
See you later, Albie.

1584
01:38:39,166 --> 01:38:41,414
- You all right?
- Yeah, go on.

1585
01:38:43,707 --> 01:38:46,207
You all right?
Look like you're struggling there.

1586
01:38:46,332 --> 01:38:47,957
Help me.

1587
01:38:48,082 --> 01:38:51,082
Help you?
What are you doing?

1588
01:38:51,207 --> 01:38:53,039
Help me put the top on.

1589
01:38:53,166 --> 01:38:56,082
- Oh, I'm not sure I can help you.
- Reggie, please, it's going to get ruined.

1590
01:38:56,207 --> 01:38:59,164
I can't, can I? I'm a club owner.
You know what I mean?

1591
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:02,748
I can pick a nice model, all right,
in a nice color,

1592
01:39:02,875 --> 01:39:05,582
but I'm not very good at anything else.
I'm not a mechanic, am I?

1593
01:39:05,707 --> 01:39:09,248
I'm more of a... a gangster,
isn't that right? Yeah?

1594
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:10,414
Please help me.

1595
01:39:10,541 --> 01:39:12,832
Please help you?

1596
01:39:12,957 --> 01:39:14,539
"Please.

1597
01:39:14,666 --> 01:39:16,373
"Please, Reggie. "

1598
01:39:17,582 --> 01:39:20,248
All right, let's help you, then.
Go on, then.

1599
01:39:20,375 --> 01:39:21,582
How's that?

1600
01:39:21,707 --> 01:39:24,373
It looks a bit
fucking fucked to me, mate.

1601
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:26,914
Speaking of...

1602
01:39:28,082 --> 01:39:30,289
You look like shit and all.

1603
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:42,832
Yeah.

1604
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:17,707
What are you doing?
Reggie, stop it!

1605
01:40:17,832 --> 01:40:19,373
Stop it!

1606
01:40:24,707 --> 01:40:25,789
Reggie!

1607
01:40:28,957 --> 01:40:31,164
- Stop what?
- Please stop. Please stop.

1608
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:33,998
- Reggie, please stop. Please stop.
- Stop what?

1609
01:40:34,125 --> 01:40:35,539
Please, no!

1610
01:40:35,666 --> 01:40:37,832
Please! No!

1611
01:40:37,957 --> 01:40:39,582
Stop it!

1612
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:56,457
Where are you going?

1613
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:59,832
I'm leaving Reggie.

1614
01:40:59,957 --> 01:41:03,082
Oh, that is a shame,
he will take that very hard.

1615
01:41:03,207 --> 01:41:05,414
Please get out of my way, Ron.

1616
01:41:05,541 --> 01:41:07,707
Unless you prefer me to stay.

1617
01:41:09,875 --> 01:41:12,164
All right, boys, go upstairs. Go on.

1618
01:41:16,082 --> 01:41:17,957
Would you like me
to help you with your bags?

1619
01:41:18,082 --> 01:41:20,373
- No, thank you.
- Oh, come on. Don't be daft.

1620
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:23,039
Look at the size of you,
look at the size of me, come on.

1621
01:41:23,166 --> 01:41:24,707
Come on.

1622
01:41:24,832 --> 01:41:28,164
You know, Frances,
sometimes to achieve greatness,

1623
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:30,748
you do, you have to cut off
a little piece of yourself

1624
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:33,582
no matter how much it hurts,
in order to grow, in order to move on.

1625
01:41:33,707 --> 01:41:36,582
It takes courage
and I admire that, you know?

1626
01:41:36,707 --> 01:41:39,748
To be honest,
I think you're getting out just in time.

1627
01:41:39,875 --> 01:41:42,414
- You think so?
- Absolutely, yeah.

1628
01:41:42,541 --> 01:41:44,748
There's so many people
who know so much about us.

1629
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:47,664
Not you, of course. You know.

1630
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:50,332
Most people hate us.

1631
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:55,457
Sooner or later, someone's going to talk
and that'll be it, it'll be over.

1632
01:41:55,582 --> 01:41:57,414
That wouldn't be so bad, would it?

1633
01:42:00,707 --> 01:42:03,582
I think God ought to cut us
some slack, though, don't you think?

1634
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,539
Yeah, I'm sure God will.

1635
01:42:09,832 --> 01:42:11,248
That is...

1636
01:42:12,082 --> 01:42:13,539
That is bang out of order.

1637
01:42:13,666 --> 01:42:16,457
That's not how we were brought up,
not at all.

1638
01:42:17,375 --> 01:42:18,414
Ron, I've got to go.

1639
01:42:18,541 --> 01:42:21,998
Yeah, course you do.
Listen here, Frances, right?

1640
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:25,623
We both love him, all right?

1641
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:28,123
We both made the effort.

1642
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:31,498
So we shall just have to see
what happens when we get there.

1643
01:42:33,916 --> 01:42:35,498
Where?

1644
01:42:37,541 --> 01:42:38,582
Heaven.

1645
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,332
Goodbye, Ron.

1646
01:42:47,957 --> 01:42:49,832
Bye, Frances.

1647
01:42:50,791 --> 01:42:52,748
Listen here,

1648
01:42:53,957 --> 01:42:57,289
I always liked you, Frances,
I always did.

1649
01:42:58,332 --> 01:43:02,248
'Cause you have the ability
to see into the future.

1650
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:03,998
You do.

1651
01:43:04,916 --> 01:43:06,998
And that's the same as me.

1652
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,832
Bye, now.

1653
01:43:54,125 --> 01:43:56,082
All right, Reggie?

1654
01:43:56,207 --> 01:43:57,998
How are you?

1655
01:43:58,125 --> 01:44:00,582
Yeah. You all right, Frank?
Long time no see?

1656
01:44:00,707 --> 01:44:02,789
- I've been walking straight, you know.
- Oh, yeah?

1657
01:44:02,916 --> 01:44:05,373
- Yeah.
- That's nice, innit?

1658
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:07,957
That's nice.

1659
01:44:08,082 --> 01:44:09,748
What can I do for you?

1660
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,373
Frances here?

1661
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:17,539
It's just that I've been outside your
parents' house the last couple of weeks.

1662
01:44:17,666 --> 01:44:21,123
And they hadn't told me
that she left, so, you know,

1663
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:24,332
I've been standing underneath
her window like a fool.

1664
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:28,998
- Yeah, she's here.
- Yeah, I know.

1665
01:44:30,791 --> 01:44:33,039
- Reggie...
- What?

1666
01:44:35,832 --> 01:44:38,748
I haven't seen her like this
in a long time.

1667
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,248
She's delicate.

1668
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:42,998
Right. All right.

1669
01:44:43,125 --> 01:44:45,414
You tell Frances to come out here
'cause I had to come out here.

1670
01:44:45,541 --> 01:44:48,082
- Why don't you just go and get Frances?
- I'm not letting you see her.

1671
01:44:48,207 --> 01:44:50,582
- Don't fuck about!
- Frank?

1672
01:44:50,707 --> 01:44:52,582
Frances, get back inside.
What are you doing?

1673
01:44:52,707 --> 01:44:53,914
It's OK.

1674
01:44:54,041 --> 01:44:55,664
Hi, Reggie.

1675
01:44:56,375 --> 01:44:57,914
Hello, Frances.

1676
01:44:59,832 --> 01:45:01,082
Have you got a moment?

1677
01:45:02,457 --> 01:45:03,707
Let's have a little chat.

1678
01:45:03,832 --> 01:45:06,082
- It's all right.
- Are you sure about this?

1679
01:45:07,291 --> 01:45:09,582
Go inside and put the kettle on.

1680
01:45:13,125 --> 01:45:14,832
Frankie, come home.

1681
01:45:15,707 --> 01:45:17,289
I am home.

1682
01:45:18,541 --> 01:45:20,582
At least until I find somewhere else.

1683
01:45:20,707 --> 01:45:22,707
I can't go and live with my mum.

1684
01:45:24,291 --> 01:45:26,457
What can I do to change your mind?

1685
01:45:27,707 --> 01:45:29,164
You can't.

1686
01:45:31,082 --> 01:45:32,957
I've changed my mind
about one thing, though.

1687
01:45:33,082 --> 01:45:34,414
What's that?

1688
01:45:35,291 --> 01:45:37,539
I do want you to remember me.

1689
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:40,332
Always.

1690
01:45:41,125 --> 01:45:43,748
That I existed,
that I once walked beside you.

1691
01:45:43,875 --> 01:45:45,082
What are you on about?

1692
01:45:46,082 --> 01:45:47,707
Frankie, come on.

1693
01:45:48,541 --> 01:45:49,873
I always imagined, you know,

1694
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,207
I thought that we might have
a child or two, you know.

1695
01:45:53,416 --> 01:45:56,289
Why? So you could use them
to threaten me?

1696
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:57,957
No.

1697
01:45:58,832 --> 01:46:00,373
No, because I still love you.

1698
01:46:01,416 --> 01:46:02,873
No.

1699
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,373
No, it's just a thing you say out of loyalty
to something

1700
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,914
- that didn't exist in the first place.
- That's not true.

1701
01:46:08,041 --> 01:46:10,832
Loving you is the only thing
that holds me together.

1702
01:46:15,582 --> 01:46:17,289
You know, I...

1703
01:46:17,416 --> 01:46:20,789
I dreamt that we could live
beyond the place we were meant for.

1704
01:46:22,666 --> 01:46:25,373
But you're a gangster
and you love being one.

1705
01:46:25,957 --> 01:46:27,082
No.

1706
01:46:27,207 --> 01:46:29,289
No, Frances, listen.

1707
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:33,164
Please let me make amends

1708
01:46:33,291 --> 01:46:36,832
for the suffering and the pain
that I have caused you, please.

1709
01:46:37,832 --> 01:46:39,248
Please.

1710
01:46:41,041 --> 01:46:44,082
- Just let me take you somewhere.
- Somewhere?

1711
01:46:44,207 --> 01:46:47,539
Yeah. Anywhere.
Anywhere you want.

1712
01:46:48,791 --> 01:46:51,789
Just the two of us
so we can be together.

1713
01:46:52,957 --> 01:46:55,414
It could be like
our second honeymoon or...

1714
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,039
Or not. Just so that you can know
that I can change.

1715
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:04,207
That... To be fair, I have.
I've... I've changed.

1716
01:47:07,957 --> 01:47:10,414
All I'm saying is
is that the center of the world

1717
01:47:10,541 --> 01:47:13,498
can be anywhere you want it to be.

1718
01:47:14,207 --> 01:47:15,832
Anywhere.

1719
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:18,207
Ibiza.

1720
01:47:18,332 --> 01:47:21,123
- Who?
- Ibiza.

1721
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:23,332
Let's go there,
I like the way the word sounds.

1722
01:47:23,457 --> 01:47:26,164
Yeah, you know what,
I like the way the word sounds, too.

1723
01:47:27,082 --> 01:47:29,457
You want to... We go to Ibiza?

1724
01:47:29,582 --> 01:47:32,248
I'll get the tickets today.
I'll book 'em today.

1725
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:28,957
<i>'God doesn't ask

01:48:35,582 --> 01:48:36,873

1730
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,539
<i>'That's a choice as well. '</i>

1731
01:48:55,207 --> 01:48:57,789
<i>'A cup of tea can solve anything.</i>

1732
01:48:57,916 --> 01:49:00,414
<i>'A bit under the weather? Tea.</i>

1733
01:49:00,541 --> 01:49:03,539
<i>'You've left your husband?
Tea is the answer. '</i>

1734
01:49:03,666 --> 01:49:07,248
Frances? Bloody hell, Frances.
What have you done? Frances!

1735
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:10,164
<i>'In case you thought,
"At least Frances survived</i>

1736

<i>'God had finally cut me some slack. '</i>

1740
01:49:20,541 --> 01:49:22,373
Where is she?

1741
01:49:23,207 --> 01:49:24,498
In her bedroom.

1742
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:31,164

One big hat.

1748
01:52:09,707 --> 01:52:13,832
Well, sit down. Don't stand around here
like some kind of lamppost.

1749
01:52:17,916 --> 01:52:19,289
Squeeze in.

1750
01:52:19,416 --> 01:52:21,332
Sweaty, what don't we have?

1751
01:52:21,457 --> 01:52:22,789
A bottle. Go on.

1752
01:52:24,041 --> 01:52:25,873
- Go on. Go on.
- Right on.

1753
01:52:32,041 --> 01:52:34,457
- You wanted to see me, Ron?
- Yeah, I do, actually.

1754
01:52:34,582 --> 01:52:36,414
I want you to kill somebody for me,
all right?

1755
01:52:36,541 --> 01:52:38,957
I'm gonna give you Ł1,000.

1756
01:52:39,832 --> 01:52:41,582
Leslie.

1757
01:52:43,541 --> 01:52:47,539
There's Ł500 there, all right?
So that's half. Yeah?

1758
01:52:47,666 --> 01:52:49,582
You get the rest when it's done.

1759
01:52:49,707 --> 01:52:51,957
You can count it all
'cause it's all there

1760
01:52:52,082 --> 01:52:54,373
and you can put it
in your little pocket.

1761
01:52:55,582 --> 01:52:57,457
That's for you.

1762
01:52:57,582 --> 01:53:01,207
Go on, put it in your fucking pocket.
We know you ain't got any money.

1763
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:04,248
Don't be daft.

1764
01:53:06,832 --> 01:53:07,873
Who is it?

1765
01:53:37,082 --> 01:53:38,873
Mum, wait here.

1766
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,957
- Stop, Mum, leave it.
- You killed her!

1767
01:53:51,082 --> 01:53:54,582
You killed my daughter, you bastard!
You killed her!

1768
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,707
And your Ł100 a week
on flowers won't bring her back!

1769
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,789
Murderer!

1770
01:54:02,916 --> 01:54:06,914
You're gonna rot in hell, Reggie Kray!

1771
01:54:51,166 --> 01:54:53,457
McVitie, what are you doing here?

1772
01:54:53,582 --> 01:54:55,748
I've got a message for you.

1773
01:54:55,875 --> 01:54:57,539
From Ron.

1774
01:55:08,332 --> 01:55:09,957
Fuck!

1775
01:55:44,166 --> 01:55:46,914
Shall I send a solicitor?
Or have you seen to that?

1776
01:55:50,541 --> 01:55:54,289
I want my wife and children's
safety guaranteed.

1777
01:56:06,541 --> 01:56:08,164
Payne.

1778
01:56:08,750 --> 01:56:10,832
He's given them everything.

1779
01:56:10,957 --> 01:56:12,707
Names.

1780
01:56:12,832 --> 01:56:15,457
Dates, times.

1781
01:56:15,582 --> 01:56:17,539
Documents. The lot.

1782
01:56:20,207 --> 01:56:22,332
They've put two and two together,

1783
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:26,082
taken a dozen witnesses
into protection.

1784
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:31,539
Nipper...

1785
01:56:34,541 --> 01:56:36,414
Yeah? Nipper what?

1786
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,539
The barmaid.

1787
01:56:42,707 --> 01:56:44,539
He got the barmaid back in.

1788
01:56:46,957 --> 01:56:48,539
She ain't come out.

1789
01:56:54,332 --> 01:56:55,373
Where's Ron?

1790
01:57:03,707 --> 01:57:05,498
Oh, yeah.

1791
01:57:09,582 --> 01:57:11,914
This is a piece of me, this.

1792
01:57:12,041 --> 01:57:15,207
- Oh, yeah, I love this song.
- Yeah, it's your favorite.

1793
01:57:29,291 --> 01:57:31,123
Oh, fuck off, soppy bollocks.

1794
01:57:31,957 --> 01:57:32,998
What?

1795
01:57:40,582 --> 01:57:42,414
- Say what?
- Fuck off.

1796
01:57:49,375 --> 01:57:52,123
Cheer up, twinkle toes.

1797
01:57:52,250 --> 01:57:54,082
It's nearly Christmas.

1798
01:57:54,207 --> 01:57:56,873
Why don't you have a little dance
or something, you know?

1799
01:57:58,666 --> 01:58:01,582
What is the point of coming out
to a party like this

1800
01:58:01,707 --> 01:58:03,539
if you're not going to enjoy yourself?

1801
01:58:04,750 --> 01:58:07,164
I'm waiting for Jack the Hat.

1802
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:10,539
Oh, right.
What's he been doing?

1803
01:58:10,666 --> 01:58:14,123
Has he been waving his shotgun around
in the clubs again?

1804
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:17,957
What did you think going after
Leslie Payne was going to get us?

1805
01:58:18,082 --> 01:58:20,039
What do I think?

1806
01:58:20,166 --> 01:58:22,207
You heard.

1807
01:58:22,332 --> 01:58:24,082
Well, in case you ain't realised,

1808
01:58:24,207 --> 01:58:27,498
I don't fucking
answer to you, sweetheart.

1809
01:58:30,041 --> 01:58:31,957
Now we're back to business.

1810
01:58:32,916 --> 01:58:35,539
Here he is. Come on, come on, Ron,
show us how it's done.

1811
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:37,539
I've got the moves.

1812
01:58:37,666 --> 01:58:41,289
- Hello, hello. Where the birds at?
- Hey, it's Jack the Hat.

1813
01:58:41,416 --> 01:58:44,414
Mr Bender, how are you?
Nice to see you.

1814
01:58:45,416 --> 01:58:46,664
- Esther?
- Jackie.

1815
01:58:46,791 --> 01:58:49,539
I should never have let you go.
That was an absolute mistake.

1816
01:58:49,666 --> 01:58:50,873
I'm gonna get myself a drink.

1817
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,832
Then I'm gonna come back, and I'll
tell you why I shouldn't have let you go.

1818
01:58:53,957 --> 01:58:55,414
I promise.

1819
01:58:56,166 --> 01:58:58,123
Hello, Leslie. How are you?

1820
01:59:01,832 --> 01:59:03,789
Ron.

1821
01:59:10,375 --> 01:59:11,873
Teddy.

1822
01:59:12,541 --> 01:59:15,207
There you go, Ron, look.
Jack's here.

1823
01:59:15,332 --> 01:59:17,957
What's your stories,
morning glories?

1824
01:59:26,957 --> 01:59:29,414
Here you are, Jack. Cigarette.

1825
01:59:29,541 --> 01:59:31,539
I quit on the way down the stairs.

1826
01:59:39,541 --> 01:59:41,582
You got something on your mind, Reg?

1827
01:59:42,541 --> 01:59:44,207
Yeah.

1828
01:59:44,332 --> 01:59:46,498
Yeah, you're on my mind, mate.

1829
01:59:47,125 --> 01:59:48,248
Leslie Payne?

1830
01:59:50,291 --> 01:59:53,664
What the fuck were you thinking?

1831
01:59:54,457 --> 01:59:55,707
You've ruined this.

1832
01:59:56,875 --> 01:59:59,998
- I don't know what you're on about.
- Don't fucking lie to me!

1833
02:00:01,957 --> 02:00:04,707
- I don't want to be treated this way.
- How do you want to be treated?

1834
02:00:04,832 --> 02:00:06,248
- Ron?
- Shut up.

1835
02:00:06,375 --> 02:00:09,789
- He ain't gonna fucking help you, is he?
- You got a tin of worms in your head.

1836
02:00:09,916 --> 02:00:12,414
Don't take it out on me
what happened to Frances.

1837
02:00:13,207 --> 02:00:14,539
I'm sorry, what did you say?

1838
02:00:15,207 --> 02:00:18,914
It's not my fault Frances killed herself.
I never sold her the fucking pills.

1839
02:00:19,041 --> 02:00:21,164
You've got to be joking.
Are you fucking joking?

1840
02:00:21,291 --> 02:00:22,373
Reggie.

1841
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:23,998
Go on, fucking shoot him.

1842
02:00:24,125 --> 02:00:26,123
Say that again. Go on.

1843
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:27,539
Reggie.

1844
02:00:27,666 --> 02:00:30,289
Say her fucking name.
I dare you.

1845
02:00:36,541 --> 02:00:38,414
Frances.

1846
02:01:16,291 --> 02:01:18,373
Why would you do that?

1847
02:01:22,957 --> 02:01:24,582
Because I can't kill you.

1848
02:01:25,457 --> 02:01:28,207
No matter how much I fucking want to.

1849
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,664
Reggie.

1850
02:02:03,207 --> 02:02:04,707
Reggie?

1851
02:02:04,832 --> 02:02:06,332
Reggie?

1852
02:02:06,457 --> 02:02:08,123
Reggie, look at me.

1853
02:02:08,250 --> 02:02:10,373
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1854
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:13,039
You kill a geezer
in a room full of people.

1855
02:02:13,166 --> 02:02:14,582
Are you fucking mad?

1856
02:02:17,041 --> 02:02:18,123
What?

1857
02:03:35,541 --> 02:03:37,748
<i>'Reggie once said,
"The center of the world</i>

1858
02:03:37,875 --> 02:03:39,707
<i>"'could be anywhere you like. "</i>

1859
02:03:39,832 --> 02:03:43,123
<i>'Even here,
in the East End of London.</i>

1860
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:45,082

1861
02:03:45,207 --> 02:03:49,039
<i>'It's not good, it's not bad,
it just is.</i>

1862
02:03:49,166 --> 02:03:51,332
<i>'There's no morality or dishonor,</i>

1863
02:03:51,457 --> 02:03:53,414
<i>'just your own lonely code.</i>

1864
02:03:53,541 --> 02:03:56,832
<i>'Until your race is run. Until the end.</i>

1865
02:03:56,957 --> 02:04:01,039
<i>'Until we're all just ghosts of
the people we once thought we were. '</i>

1866
02:04:22,875 --> 02:04:26,873
<i>'Reggie spent 33 years
in prison for killing Jack McVitie.</i>
