00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,840
{\an8}Ok. Can you get off? Good boy.

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,280
{\an8}[May] Oh, Helen?
We're hosting book club tonight.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,760
Do you want to join us?

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,760
Same room, people. Can't hear you
unless you're in the same room.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,240
Can't hear ya, May!

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,840
We are hosting book club tonight.
Would you like to join us?

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,640
-We're doing Three Women.
-Uh...

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,520
Doing three women!

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,360
Why is that funny?

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,920
-Doing.
-What?

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,840
It's not funny,
but what he's saying is, like,

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,560
that you're...doing three women.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,480
Yeah.

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,440
Yeah, but he's saying it as, like...

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,480
<i>Doing</i> doing,

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,760
not, not doing,
but, you know, doing.

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,120
You know, you're...doing.

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,240
-Oh!
-Doing.

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,920
Intercourse.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,160
Mmm.

[theme music]

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,440
Helen? This is Terry Montanello.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,440
Said he's here to see Roz,
but she's not in.

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,360
That's Ok. Terry. Come in.
Thanks, George.

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,880
I'm Helen. I'm the new Roz.
Sit down. Go. Talk.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,280
What do you need? What can I do for
you? Somebody died? What's happened?

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,680
Well, my great-aunt, Maria,
she passed away.

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,680
-And I was...
-Yep. That's very sad.

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,600
I'm sorry,
have you really replaced Roz?

31
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,400
-Yeah. I'm the new Roz.
-Hello, Terry. Sorry I'm late.

32
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,120
Thank you, Helen.
I'll take it from here.

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,960
Off you pop.
Helen says she's your replacement.

34
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,760
Oh, God, no. Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,680
-No.
-Well, that's a relief.

36
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,920
-[Roz laughs]
-Is it?

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,480
-N-no offense. Sorry.
-Alright. Well, point of order, Terry.

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,000
Just because you say "No offense,"

39
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,040
it doesn't render the offensive
thing you just said not offensive.

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,160
Helen, why don't you go and work
on bringing in some new business?

41
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,280
-You're not required here.
-That's offensive.

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,000
Now, let's get to know
your Aunt Maria. In the will...

43
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,520
You should know, Terry, that Roz
can't work as a solicitor anymore.

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,160
-She was struck off.
-Oh, I'm sorry, suspended.

45
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,160
-Out!
-Just so you know.

46
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,640
Sorry.

47
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,200
-[laughs]
-[gasps] That's an excellent choice.

48
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,720
Ray, can I ask a couple of questions
about this case you don't want to do?

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Yeah. Make it quick. I got to
get to court for the listing.

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,360
-No, it's Monday.
-So?

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,720
-Well, listings are on Tuesday.
-What are you, the boss of court?

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
-Hurry up. What do you need?
-Ok.

53
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,920
-No time for sitting, buddy.
-So I read the file.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
-Uh-huh.
-It says the brother gets the farm.

55
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,280
The sister gets the family Bible.
Seriously?

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,360
Yeah,
but apparently very nice Bible.

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,000
It's got Jesus and prayers in it.

58
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,640
There's a burning bush

59
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,560
and some begetting and begatting,
that kind of stuff.

60
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,840
Wow. You're really selling it.

61
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,000
But we're representing the brother,
who drives a party bus.

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,040
-Is that right?
-Yeah. And?

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,680
I don't get it. It says the sister
worked the farm her whole life.

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,800
Why was she left out?

65
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,040
Dad was old-school
and believed that...ohh...

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,600
property should be
handed down the male line,

67
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,040
which would never stand up in court.

68
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,600
I propose we get on the front foot
and suggest 50/50 split.

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
-Ok. Well, that's easy.
-Not really.

70
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,680
Alice Pike
is representing the sister,

71
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,160
and she'll be gunning
for a lot more than half.

72
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,400
So? I'll just tell her, "The deal's
50/50. You take it or leave it."

73
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,240
[laughs]
I'm loving your confidence, Fisk.

74
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,600
I almost wish I could stick around
and watch the car crash.

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,800
-But I can't. 'Cause I got to go.
-To the imaginary listings?

76
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,040
Yep. Good get from you.

77
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,080
Let's see how funny you are
after half an hour with Alice Pike.

78
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,960
What does that...
Ray, what does that mean?

79
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,600
-What do you...what...?
-Good luck, Fisk!

81
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,560
-Raymond.
-Pike.

82
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,800
We're supposed to have a meeting!

83
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,120
I handed that over
to my colleague, Helen Tudor.

84
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,480
George, if you could help out Alice,
that'd be wonderful.

85
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,440
Hello. Can I help you?
[device buzzes]

86
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,920
Hello. Alice Pike.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,520
Yes, four o'clock on the 15th.

88
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,800
Send me an iCal invite. Let them
know I have a hard stop at 4:20.

89
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,000
Alice Pike.
I was supposed to see Raymond.

90
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,400
I believe it's now Helen Tudor.

91
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,920
-Fisk.
-What?

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,080
-Uh...uh, Tudor-Fisk.
-I'm sorry, do you speak English?

93

Hello. Alice Pike.

94
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,440
-Yes, talk to me. Quickly, please.
-[George] Uh...

95
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
And the meeting
is taking place where?

96
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,160
I think it's either, um,
Helen's office or the meeting room.

97
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,960
-I'll check.
-Got it. Text me to confirm.

98
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,160
-Thank you.
-Ok, no worries.

99
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,280
-This way?
-Yeah, just to the left.

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,840
Did you still want me
to text you to confirm or...

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,280
I'll send it to this number
on the card.

102
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
Helen Tudor, Alice Pike.

Hello. Helen Tudor-Fisk.

-Yes. Go ahead. I'm listening.
-Right.

107
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,720
Well, I'm taking over
Hopkins vs Hopkins, so...

-Yes, that's right. Thank you.
-I will be...

109
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,280
I'm sorry. You're on the phone.
No, I'm done. Helen, is it?

110
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,160
Look, I've got a hard stop at 3:30,
so let's get this done, shall we?

111
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,040
-I propose a 75/25 split.
-Ok.

112
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,000
Are we talking 75/25 or 25/75,
if you know what I mean?

113
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,960
I don't.

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,640
Hello. Alice Pike. No, I'll be
back in the office this afternoon.

115
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,760
75/25. Do we have a deal?

116
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,000
If it's 75/25, yes, we do.

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,600
You're starting
to irritate me, Helen.

118
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Right back at you,
"Hello. Alice Pike."

119
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,000
Listen to me.

120
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,080
75/25.

121
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,480
No, you listen to me,
because I'm the offeror,

122
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,920
so I say what the offer is, and
I've just decided, oh, guess what,

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,920
it's 90/10, to me, to my client.

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,480
We both know
that won't hold up in court.

125
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,800
-Do we know that?
-Do you want to find out?

126
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,480
-I do not, sir. 80/20.
-Try again.

127
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,760
-70/30.
-Stop wasting my time.

128
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,560
Best offer on the table right now
or I'll see you in court.

129
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,800
Ok.

130
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,280
-S...
-Don't you dare say 60/40.

131
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,440
I wasn't going to.
You don't know what I'm gonna say.

132
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,520
-It was gonna be, "So, offer, 50/50."
-Thank you.

133
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,880
Now we have a starting point.
I'll take that to my client.

134
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,760
Well...it's not a starting point,
it's a finishing point,

135
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,960
and you can take it or leave it.

136
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,680
-What's that, now?
-Erm, on the phone, please.

Well, well. Roz Gruber.

I'm very surprised
to see you working here.

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,960
I'm the office manager,
nothing more.

147
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,480
She doesn't work as a solicitor
anymore. She's been suspended.

148

-Oh, she knows.
-Oh, I know.

00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,840
George,
this is the infamous Alice Pike.

150
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,680
Alice is the one
who persuaded two of my clients

151
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,520
to make the complaints
that got me suspended.

Hello. Alice Pike.

00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes. This is she.

It's fine.
I'm not with anyone important.

Go ahead. I'm listening.

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,480
"This is she."
I mean, who says that?

She's full of it.

158
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,680
Like, I don't think
there's even anyone calling her.

159
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,040
-You have got to be kidding me.
-No, I'm serious. She's faking it.

Did you know Pike was here?

00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,480
Why do you think I went
and sat in the car for an hour?

163
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,480
Apparently she wants to specialize
in wills and probate!

-Come on! That's my thing!
-I'm sorry?

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,560
That's your thing. You saw
the gap in the market years ago.

166
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,560
Well done, Roz.

167
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,600
We need to get more aggressive
about new business,

168
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,880
keep her out of the market.

169
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,920
Wow. You were right about Alice Pike.

170
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,400
-Hello, Roz.
-[Roz] Helen!

171
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,960
How's your client list going?

172
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,960
We need some more business
and lots of it.

173
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,160
Uh, I took a walk-in yesterday.

174
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,880
-Well done, Helen.
-Thank you.

175
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,640
Someone wandered in.
I might go sit in the car again.

176
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,760
-That is called passive recruitment.
-I think that might be my forte.

177
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,080
You need to be more proactive,
Helen. Tout for business.

178
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,120
So, like, lurk at funeral homes
and hand out business cards?

179
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,560
-Excellent idea.
-Wasn't serious.

180
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,440
Then get serious!
Where's our client base?

181
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,320
[sighs] Post office?
Old people love the post office.

182
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,200
And Michel's Patisserie.

183
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,760
The movies, specifically
talking through the movies.

184
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,440
Church.
You can always find them at church.

185
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,080
We don't want old people.

186
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,840
We want middle-aged people
squabbling over an inheritance.

187
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,000
Got it. Squabblers.

188
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,160
Tout for squabblers.
Be a squabbler touter.

189
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,160
I actually came to see Ray.

190
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,200
W-where's Ray gone?

191
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,800
[gasps]

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,360
Careful, careful, careful -
now, can you put Leslie

193
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,640
in the chair
where she likes it, please?

194
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,920
This way.

195
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,360
My mother, you know, well, she grew
up, obviously, Second World War.

196
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,080
-So, I mean...
-Helen!

197
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,400
Um, everyone, this is Helen.
Come in. Come and join us.

198
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,560
No, I'm good, May.
I haven't read the book, so...

199
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,320
Oh, hang on. Snacks. I'm in. Ok.

200
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,760
-[woman] Hi, Helen.
-Hello.

201
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,240
As I was saying, this first chapter
really reminded me

202
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,039
of my own mother's story.

203
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,559
-Leslie's mum passed away recently.
-Oh, I see.

204
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,480
Mum had an inner strength.
Oh, she was a mother and a worker.

205
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,520
She had a part-time job
in a cake shop.

206
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,520
-Ooh. How delicious.
-She was a wife and a friend.

207
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,720
She played canasta and tenpin bowls.

208
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,480
She lived a very full life.

209
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,920
I'd really love to tell her story.

210
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,680
Feel like you are. [laughs]

211
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,680
The good thing is, I'm
taking a creative writing course.

212
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,160
So...

213
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,440
Oh, good.

214
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,120
[Leslie]
Uh, anyway, as I was saying...

215
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,640
-Is there any more wine?
-...when a parent dies...

216
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,200
Oh, God. I'm sorry, Leslie.
You're still talking.

217
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,480
...it puts things in perspective.

218
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,520
So what if you didn't get
the best park at the supermarket?

219
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,480
You know? So bloody what?

220
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,920
Speaking of car parks,
what about the chapter

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
where they had sex in the car?

222
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,480
Not now, Graham.

223
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,200
[Leslie]
What's really hard at the moment

224
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,600
is everyone
squabbling over Mum's stuff.

225
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,000
Ooh! Squabbling? How are they
squabbling there, Leslie?

226
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,680
-I don't want to sell her house.
-Mm-hm.

227
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,440
-I mean, it's full of memories.
-Yep. What does the will say?

228
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,040
-Are you the executor?
-Pardon?

229
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,760
Well, you might not
have to sell the house.

230
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,960
-Oh, Helen's a lawyer.
-Yeah.

231
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm a wills and probate specialist,
actually.

232
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,840
[woman] Oh, can I have
one of those, Helen?

233
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,160
Oh, you bet. There you go.
One for you.

234
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,880
Oh, hello. Yep.
Bringing in some new business.

235
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,640
There we go. Good stuff, all of you.
Give me a call.

236
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,920
Alright. If we can just circle back
to the sex-in-the-car scenes.

237
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,120
Weren't they titillating?

238
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,000
But also relevant.

239
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,000
[Roz] I think we should
shampoo the carpet. A dry shampoo.

240
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,360
Yeah. 'Cause you can walk on that
reasonably quick.

241
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,040
-Mmm.
-Good morning, Roz.

242
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,600
What's that?
"Did you bring in any new business?"

243
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,280
Ooh, I'm glad you asked.

244
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,080
Two new clients, and I know
where to find a whole lot more.

245
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,120
Do not say Michel's Patisserie,
because they banned me

246
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,280
the last time I was there
handing out business cards.

247
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,600
It's a shame.
They do such excellent coffee.

248
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,000
-Well, let's hear your idea, Helen.
-Two words.

249
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,000
Book club.

250
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,600
What's the second word?

251
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,880
Book clubs are full of
middle-aged people, mostly women,

252
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,560
dead or dying parents,

253
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,200
and they're all squabbling
over their inheritance.

254
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,920
That's your business strategy,
is it?

255
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,440
Walk up to complete strangers
and ask,

256
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,440
"Can I please come
to your book club?"

257
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,320
Well, it sounded less stupid
when I said it, but, essentially...

258
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,120
yes.

259
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,320
-What about the vertical blinds?
-Hmm. There's no doubt they're tired.

260
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,920
[types]

261
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,720
[whispers]
Oh! Fisk! Pike's in reception.

262
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,440
-You haven't seen me.
-What? Who's in reception?

263
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,880
-Oh! Hello, Alice Pike.
-Hello. Alice Pike.

264
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,080
I just said that!

265
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,640
Yes, that's all doable, but,
obviously, with a hard stop at 3:30.

266
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,080
Ok? Alright, circling back
to where we left off.

267
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,400
The offer was deemed untenable.

268
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,440
Is this
your new hardball act, Helen?

269
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,680
Oh, how tedious.

270
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,640
Oh, God, sorry. I thought
you were still on the phone.

271
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,360
-It's very hard to know with you.
-My client will accept 60/40.

272
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,320
-And 60 goes to...?
-To my client.

273
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,040
Well, then, I'm sorry, no deal.

274
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,880
The offer was 50/50
or I see you in court.

275
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,000
-Done.
-Thank you.

276
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,280
-50/50?
-No. I'll see you in court.

277
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,080
[Ray] We're not going to court, Fisk.

278
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,640
Where...are you in the cupboard?

279
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,280
It's more of a storeroom
than a cupboard.

280
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,000
[Roz] So there's a few ways
we can go with this.

281
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,560
And, obviously, it's your choice,
Terry, but I will say...

282
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,720
[continues indistinctly]
[camera clicks]

283
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,520

[camera clicks]

286
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,880
You want me to accept 60/40,
60 to them, 40 to us. [sighs] Why?

287
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,280
Because if we go to court,
we might end up with nothing.

288
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,360
Oh, come on!
Is Alice Pike really that good?

289
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
It's not about Pike.
It's about our client.

290
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,080
Have a look at this bloke.
Have a look.

291
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,280
-This one?
-Mmm.

292
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,240
Alright, Brandon, uh,
we're going to film today's session

293
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,680
so that we can help you
work on your presentation, so...

294
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,720
You don't...George, you
don't need me in this, just Brandon.

295
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,240
That's Brandon.
[Ray] [video] <i>Ok.</i>

296
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,800
So, the first thing
the judge might ask is,

297
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,240
"Mr Hopkins,
what do you do for a living?"

298
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,800
-Uh-huh.
-And you would say?

299
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,680
Hi, Judge. Uh, yep. Ok.

300
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,840
So, uh...I run me own business,
which is a party bus,

301
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,480
do a lot of hens' nights,
a lot of bucks' nights, but...

302
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
anyone can book it.

303
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,400
Like, say, you and...
you and your judge mates,

304
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,560
you want to go to the pub,
I can come and pick youse all up,

305
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,600
and the beauty is, you can drink
on the way to drinking at the pub.

306
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,720
How good is that?
It gets better.

307
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,280
The sound system is next-level.

308
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,640
It's so good, a lot of people
don't want to get off.

309
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,880
So we just drive around and
everyone gets munted, on the bus!

310
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,720
Not me, obviously.
I don't drink and drive, anymore.

311
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
[Ray] <i>Stop. Let's try again.</i>
[Ray] [office] Mm-hm.

312
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,720
<i>This time, when I ask you
what you do for a living,</i>

313
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,560
stop talking after
"I run me own business."

314
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,160
Yeah, but some people might not know
what a party bus is.

315
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,600
Which I think's for the best.
[laughs]

316
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,800
George? Hang on.

317
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,760
Mate, put the camera back.
We're gonna be here for a while.

318
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,640

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,520
Yeah, Ok. Point made.

I...I can show you more
if you want to see...

321
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,120
-Uh, no need. No need.
-You had me at 'munted'.

or so she says.

492
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,080
Alex is gonna be here in
half an hour, but it's not too late.

493
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,320
I could still give him a call
and explain everything.

494
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,600
Yeah, I reckon
let's just do what Ray said.

495
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,480
Ray, this is about me going
on the record and clearing my name.

496
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,720
Feels more about you showing off and
doing one of your little concerts.

497
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,680
Uh, Roz, two of your
black lady Wiggles are in reception.

498
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,160
[blows pitch pipe]
And put this on.

499
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,000
[drones]
Think you're a bit flat, Helen.

500
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,880
-You think? [drones higher]
-[Ray] Oh, for God's sake, Fisk!

501
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,280
Enough. You sound like a cow
with a vuvuzela stuck up its arse.

502
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,920
What time's Pike coming in
to sign off on the 60/40 deal?

503
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,200
-About five. [blows pitch pipe]
-Alright.

504
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,720
[drones]

505
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,640
That's nice. [drones]

506
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,720
[Man] That's a true story.
I'm not making that up.

507
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,640
[Man 2] Mate, true or made-up,
it's still not interesting.

508
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,840
And I requested a quiet ride.

509
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,400
One star.

510
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,240
[sighs]

511
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

512
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,080
distinguished guest,

513
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,680
friends beyond the binary
and member of the board.

514
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,360
-It's a pleas...
-Hurry it up, mate.

515
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,080
Thank you. Thank you, George.
I'll take it from here.

516
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,200
Good afternoon.

517
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,120
May I present to you the Sadrigals,
an all-woman madrigal group

518
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,240
available for funerals
and memorial services.

519
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,480
And this...this is Terry.

520
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,880
Would you please state who you are
for the record?

521
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,600
My name is Terry Montanello.

522
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,240
The Sadrigals will be performing

523
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,280
at the funeral of my Great-Aunt
Maria this Saturday. [laughs]

524
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,880
-And for the record...
-[Alex] There's no record.

525
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,640
This is an informal...

526
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,880
whatever this is.

527
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,080
My apologies. I'll rephrase.

528
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,560
And for those present,
would you please state

529
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,720
what you are not, Terry?

530
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,200
I am not a client
of Gruber & Associates.

531
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,920
[Roz] Thank you. Helen?

532
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,600
I also am not a client of Gruber...

533
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,240
-[Roz] Pitch pipe, pitch pipe.
-...& As...

534
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,200
Yep. Sorry.

00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,560
...but also
a complete waste of my time.

-Oh.
-Terry, sorry for your loss.

561
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,000
Ray, you couldn't just call me,
explain what happened?

562
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,440
Sorry, mate.
You know what she's like.

563
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,640
I'm too busy for this sort of shit.
I know. I know you are.

564
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,080
Thank you for coming in.
I really appreciate it, Terry.

565
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,360
So the Sondheim's definitely in
and so's the Jesus Christ...

566
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,880
She forgot to breathe!
-I can't get any air.

567
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,920
-I can't get any air.
-Here, here. Here.

568

[sighs]

569
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,640
[knocks on door] Alice Pike is here
to sign some paperwork.

570
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,800
No, I don't want to see her.
Get Ray to do it.

571
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,400
He's not here.
Check the...stationery cupboard.

572
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,960
Checked it. He's not there.

573
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,080
Oh. Ooh! Ooh!
You know where he would be?

574

577
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,040
[Alice] Well, this is sad.

578
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,600
[bell rings]

579
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,120
[Helen] Hi there.
[woman] Hi.

580
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,320
I just wanted to return these books,
please. I, um...

581
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,920
Got the receipt there?
Yeah.

582
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,280
I bought them by accident. So...

583
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,840
Is that hummus?

584
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,960
Well, I don't think so.

585
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,520
I can't take these back.
They're filthy.

586
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,240
Well, I can't read them.
They're impenetrable.

587
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,000
[Ray] So, what did we think?

588
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,160
Did anyone else get the sense
that the Shroud

589
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,640
was like a metaphor
for the sins of man?

590
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,120
No, mate. I thought it was shit.

591
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,080
Thought we were doing the book
about the cuckold.

592
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,400
I thought there'd be snacks.

593
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,400
Shall we go to the pub?

594
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,080
-[others] Yep. Yep.
-Yep? Leave those.

595
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,560
I'll whack 'em in recycling.
