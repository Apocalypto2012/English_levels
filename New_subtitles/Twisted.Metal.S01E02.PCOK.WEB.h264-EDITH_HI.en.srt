00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:28,694
Nice pipes, dude,
I have to say.

181
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,155
That high note, whoo!
It was perfect.

182
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:33,491
- Oh, word?
- Yeah, can I go?

183
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:34,826
I got somewhere to be.

184
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,452
- I thought you said
you were coming to the show!

185
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:39,539
- Of course, I am.

186
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,458
Just can I leave
after the show?

187
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:50,633
- Well, in that case,
tonight is opening night!

188
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,844
[laughing]

189
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,222
- How were your showers?

190
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:57,932
- Aw, I don't know
the last time

191
00:09:57,974 --> 00:10:00,435
I felt hot water
that wasn't my own piss.

192
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:01,686
Uh, sir.

193
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:03,229
- Consider it
your recompense

194
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,356
for upholding
law and order.

195
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:11,112
Warm showers, warm blankets,
warm meals.

196
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:14,240
- Oh.
- Aw, fuck, mashed potatoes?

197
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:17,160
- [Mike] And goddamn,
look at all that gravy!

198
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:19,954
I wonder how we can get
one of those punch cards.

199
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:23,458
- Now, let's proceed
to your initiation.

200
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,588
Right this way,
gentlemen.

201
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:34,010
What you see down there
is our supply truck.

202
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:35,845
It brings us
important provisions.

203
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:39,015
As you can see,
it's broken down.

204
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:40,933
That's why
it's not moving.

205
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:45,229
What I need for you to do
is to protect that truck.

206
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:46,647
- From what?

207
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,524
- Seagulls.

208
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,242
- [Sweet Tooth] Skittles?
- [John Doe] No, I'm good.

209
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:01,245
[chomping]
- Pre-show jitters.

210
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:03,956
Listen, I really appreciate
you coming along willingly.

211
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,708
Normally I have to drag people
into the theater

212
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,001
kicking and screaming.

213
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:08,795
But word of advice,

214
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,255
you won't like
what happens if you run.

215
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:14,717
What? Oh, him?

216
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,968
Nah, he was here
before.

217
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,095
Hey, Donald.

218
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,055
Don't worry,
he can't hear us.

219
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:21,391
I love names.
I'm kind of a name guy.

220
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,726
You know, the right one
can send a shudder

221
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:24,894
down your spine.

222
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:26,938
Wanna know
what I go by?

223
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,773
- There's not a person
on the West Coast

224
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:31,442
that hasn't heard
of Sweet Tooth.

225
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:32,610
- See what I mean?

226
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:36,197
I mean, you really
feel that in your bones!

227
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:38,574
What's your name,
friend?

228
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,993
- John Doe.

229
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,787
- Nah, I'll give it
a seven.

230
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:44,163
- Hey, I didn't
pick it.

231
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,832
I don't know what name
I was born with

232
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:49,210
or who I am really.

233
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:51,796
- Oh, amnesia.
What's your brand?

234
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:54,757
Post-traumatic,
transient, dissociative?

235
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,842
- All I know
is my first memory

236
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,844
is me waking up
in my car

237
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,345
with blood coming
out of my head.

238
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:00,930
- Wait, that's
my first memory too!

239
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:03,182
My head
covered in blood.

240
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:04,350
Of course,
it was being pushed

241
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:05,768
out of my mom's
whisker biscuit, but...

242
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,936
- Whoa!
You remember that?

243
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:10,440
- Oh, yeah.
I remember everything.

244
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,233
You should consider
yourself lucky.

245
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:14,777
There are some things
I wish I could forget.

246
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,572
Like the time
I shit my pants

247
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:20,533
in my elementary school
production of "Oklahoma".

248
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:24,203
I can still see
the audience's faces

249
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:26,748
laughing,
mocking.

250
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,544
Did you know Sisqo's
real name was Mark?

251
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,761
[grunting]

252
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:42,680
- [Stu] Oh, a rock.

253
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:46,559
- Man, what is
wrong with you?

254
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:48,644
You holding in a fart
or something?

255
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:51,314
- If the truck is so important,
why don't they just move it?

256
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,483
Something doesn't
smell right, man.

257
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,651
- Smells good to me.

258
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:57,612
Back in Seattle,
they treated us like morons.

259
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,448
Now look at us;
we holding .30-cals, dude!

260
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,076
Come on, baby,
get your head in the game.

261
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,828
Come on. Come on.

262
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,663
There you go.
- Fuck you!

263
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:09,499
- Eyes up, boys.

264
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:13,002
Those seagulls lay a fingernail
on our supplies,

265
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:15,546
it's open season.

266
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:16,964
- What the hell?

267
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:19,008
Hey, why do you
call 'em seagulls?

268
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,718
These look like
normal survivors to me.

269
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,679
- What else would you call
a bunch of fucking trash eaters?

270
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:36,275
- Dude, are we really
gonna kill these guys?

271
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:39,946
[suppressed gunshot]

272
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,531
- There's one left, Stu.

273
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,366
He's all yours.

274
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:56,421
Clean it up!

275
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,180
[suppressed gunshot]

276
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:09,726
[laughter]
Melon down.

277
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,227
- I saved your ass.

278
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:13,896
- [Agent Stone] Seagulls,
butchers, exiles.

279
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:17,233
They see the world
in shades of gray.

280
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:19,902
What I need
from you two lawmen

281
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:21,112
is to just show them

282
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:23,740
that there's only two colors
in the world,

283
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:27,326
black and blue.

284
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:31,289
Now, you missed, Stu.
It can happen to anyone.

285
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,833
Rookie mistake.

286
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,878
Hey, don't let it
happen again.

287
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,507
Okay.

288
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:44,385
You guys want
some burgers?

289
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:46,471
- Bubby-baby,
bubby-baby.

290
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,181
Tip of the teat,
tip of the teat.

291
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,640
Tip of the teat.

292
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:54,187
My marvelous mutterer
makes me mingy on Monday.

293
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,314
- You sleep here?

294
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:58,107
What, the penthouse
was booked up?

295
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:00,026
- Nah, way too much
space up there.

296
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:01,235
Nice bidet, though.

297
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,488
Like taking a shotgun
up the ass.

298
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,990
No, I sleep here
because it reminds me

299
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:08,409
of where I was
before Vegas.

300
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:11,370
Back then, I lived with
a real solid group of dudes.

301
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:15,041
But then the world took a shit
and I came to Sin City.

302
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,503
Now that was a party.

303
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:21,130
- You've been here alone
for over two decades?

304
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:24,050
- Oh, shit, has it been
that long?

305
00:15:24,092 --> 00:15:25,301
Look at this guy.

306
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:27,929
Hasn't aged a day.
What a beauty.

307
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,305
Nah, I'm not alone.

308
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:31,307
I got Harold,
which, have you...

309
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:32,975
you haven't met
Harold yet.

310
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:35,812
I'm gonna introduce you.

311
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,439
This is Harold.

312
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:40,650
Been my best friend
since I was a kid.

313
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,944
You know, my entire life
people have been lying to me.

314
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,405
Even my fucking parents!

315
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,448
But, uh, never Harold.

316
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,993
No, he can't lie to me.
He can't lie to anyone.

317
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,578
- I can see that.

318
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,704
[sighing]

319
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:55,665
- I don't know what I'd do
without him.

320
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,708
Look at that smile.

321
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,419
So, you got a Harold?

322
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,671
- No.
I got an Evelyn.

323
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:03,339
- Oh, that's cute.

324
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:07,510
- Before I met her,
being alone was all I knew.

325
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:10,012
You know, she makes
everything easier, you know?

326
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:13,683
Sometimes I wish I could
make her laugh. Right?

327
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:15,351
I have to say
after all this time

328
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:17,937
that's the sound
I miss the most.

329
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:20,189
- [Sweet Tooth] You know
what sound I miss the most?

330
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:23,192
The sound of hand meat
clapping together.

331
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:25,611
Nothing like that
glorious applause.

332
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,405
I mean, it's almost better
than, I don't know,

333
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:29,449
hearing somebody choking
on their own blood.

334
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,284
But look at me
getting carried away.

335
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,578
Good thing that your Evelyn's
got hands, huh?

336
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,538
She must clap for you
all the time.

337
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,874
- Nah, she doesn't.
She's my car.

338
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,333
- You talk to your car?

339
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,879
That's weird, man.

340
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,216
Ah, mwah!
There you are.

341
00:16:47,258 --> 00:16:51,304
So, if Evelyn's not the girl,
who's she?

342
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,601
I caught this little pest
crawling through my vents.

343
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:58,478
See, I was gonna
starve her.

344
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,480
Watching the life slowly
drain from their eyes.

345
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,857
Kind of
my artistic process.

346
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:04,567
[laughing]

347
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:08,321
You know, the last guy
lasted almost four weeks.

348
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,864
Hey, Wilbur!

349
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:12,200
I think she's gonna give you
a run for you money.

350
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:13,659
She won't.

351
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,413
Bubby-baby, bubby-baby.

352
00:17:17,455 --> 00:17:19,957
- Hey, you tried to kill me
