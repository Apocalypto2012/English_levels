JOHN: I get something
in me head, you know,

16
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:20,378
and all the walls of
Rome couldn't stop me.

17

JOHN:
All right, pickled onion.

18
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:27,519
PAUL: I remember so
vividly showing up at the show

19
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,454
and you'd be
in your ordinary clothes,

20
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:32,089
and then you'd take out
of your little suitcase

21
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:35,927
your suit and your shirt,

22
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:41,399
and put 'em on, and then
finally your Beatle boots...

23
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:44,636
and you'd stand up, and you
just looked at each other,

24
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:47,405
like, yeah, there we are.

25
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:50,608

and this is Beatleland,
formally known as Britain,

50
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,748
where an epidemic
called Beatlemania

51
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:06,384
has seized
the teenage population.

52
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:08,520
MAN: Usual
here at London Airport.

53
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,988
Hundreds and hundreds
of young Beatles fans.

54
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:13,325
The younger generation
is going to hell.

55
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:14,459
Just gorgeous.

56
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,328
‐ MAN: They're what?
‐ They're gorgeous.

57
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:18,630
Their haircuts and clothes,
they're setting a new fashion.

58
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,698
The various things,
their clothes, their hair.

59
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:22,099
They sound different.

60
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:24,001
They're confident,
they're natural.

61
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:26,838
They sort of represent
the teenage people.

62
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:30,508

PAUL: By the end,
it became quite complicated,

66
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:53,731
but at the beginning,
things were really simple.

67
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:56,701
Thank you very much, everybody.

68
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:58,636
Thank you.

69
00:03:58,636 --> 00:04:00,505
Thank you very much!

70
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,209
PAUL: A lot of
people thought we were

71
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:06,077
an overnight sensation.

72
00:04:06,077 --> 00:04:07,812
We weren't.

73
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:10,848
People didn't realize
we had all this development.

74
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:13,518
They just saw these four things

75
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:15,687
that looked alike
with this haircut,

76
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:17,522
and they knew how to play.

77
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:19,424
And they were a bit
of a laugh, you know,

78
00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:21,025
because that's
what we'd been doing

79
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:23,428
all those years previously.

80
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,033
JOHN: I had a group.

81
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:31,636
I was the singer and the leader.

82
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:34,672
I met Paul, said do you
wanna join me band, yeah,

83
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:37,475
and then George joined.

84
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:40,011
We were great
live performers then.

85
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:41,379
I don't think anybody
in the world saw us

86
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:42,747
outside of Liverpool
and the few places

87
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:44,549
where we traveled to,
because that's when

88
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:47,118
we had to perform live
to a small audience

89
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:48,119
in the dance hall.

90
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:50,155
We had to hold them.

91
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:52,657
PAUL: We were
just playing all the time.

92
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:57,028
Then we went out to Hamburg,
and that was a real slog.

93
00:04:58,563 --> 00:05:03,168
We were playing, sometimes,
eight hours a day.

94
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:05,437
I was right in the middle
of the naughtiest city

95
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:08,973
in the world at 17 years old.

96
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:11,376
It was kind of exciting.

97
00:05:16,414 --> 00:05:18,082
RINGO: I was with Rory Storm.

98
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:20,585
We were like
the top band in Liverpool,

99
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,420
and for some reason,
this guy in Hamburg

100
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,088
decided to come to Liverpool
and take

101
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:27,124
all the bands
to Germany to play.

102
00:05:27,124 --> 00:05:31,829
Well, we went to see these
punks, and that was it.

103
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:34,232
PAUL: I still remember
that moment the first time

104
00:05:34,232 --> 00:05:36,100
Ringo played with us.

105
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,335
Bang, he kicks in.

106
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:39,837
And it was an Oh My God moment.

107
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:42,207
I remember looking, and we're
all looking at each other

108
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:44,342
like, yeah, this is it.

109
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,546
Whoo, I'm getting
very emotional.

110
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,488
JOHN: Once we got
Ringo, we started to do better,

111
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:59,524
and sort of
do it professionally.

112
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:01,125
You know, for me,
I'm an only child.

113
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:04,095
I felt like I suddenly
had three brothers.

114
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:10,168
RINGO:
We just wanted to play.

115
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:13,871
Playin' was
the most important thing.

116
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:17,074
GEORGE: Hamburg was
a bit messy, I mean, to sleep

117
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:19,411
all huddled together
in one room.

118
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:21,045
There were no bathroom
or anything,

119
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:22,447
but then we'd had
practice because

120
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:25,317
we didn't have a bathroom
at home.

121
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:27,652
JOHN: We used to have this
saying that I used to chant,

122
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:29,086
and they would answer.

123
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:30,755
When they were depressed,
you know,

124
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:32,490
when the group was going nowhere

125
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,693
and this was a shitty deal,
we're in a shitty dressing room,

126
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:38,129
I'd say, where we goin' fellas?
And they'd go‐‐

127
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:40,198
GEORGE: To the top, Johnny.

128
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:41,199
JOHN: And I'd say,
where's that, fellas?

129
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,767
And they'd say,

130
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,636
GEORGE: To the toppermost
of the poppermost, Johnny.

131
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:49,774
JOHN: I'd say, right,
and we'd all say, cheer up.

132
00:06:51,075 --> 00:06:53,278
We were always kinda
a little nervous

133
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:57,415
before each step
we went up the ladder,

134
00:06:57,415 --> 00:07:01,319

what was to come.

In one meteoric year,

138
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:19,003
they've led the way
from the cellars of Liverpool

139

eventually will move on
to a new favorite?

142

worry about things like that.

GEORGE: It's not worth
missing your sleep for it.

‐ No.

(audience cheers and applauds)

148
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:44,028
I was living in Sweden,
and the Beatles came to Sweden.

149
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:45,763
I remember, I went day after day

150
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:48,633
and stood outside
the hotel at the end of school,

151
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:54,206
and I just remember seeing
their figures on a balcony.

152
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:56,774
Once a day, the Beatles
would come out and wave.

00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:58,470
with your friends
as you went through life.

177
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,872
Oh, screaming, screaming.
That's reminded me, yes.

178
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:03,175
Do you say,
why do they scream?

179
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:06,911
I don't know.
I couldn't tell you.

180
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:08,513
(laughs)

181
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:10,014
If somebody scores a goal,

182
00:09:10,014 --> 00:09:14,586
there's a louder cheer
from all the people.

183
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:16,988
If we shake our heads,
it's the equivalent

184
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:18,323
of scoring a goal.

185
00:09:18,323 --> 00:09:20,792
(indistinct)
... who screams the loudest?

186
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:21,959
Do you see what I mean?

187
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,060
Yes, yes I do understand.

188
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,262
You'll do that, and they scream.

189
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:26,231
(playing "Twist and Shout")

190
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:27,965

VINTAGE NARRATOR:
This is the BBC Home Service.

217
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:50,315
Here is the news,
read by Frank Phillips.

218
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:51,716
FRANK PHILLIPS:
Thousands of teenagers

219
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:53,885
who had been waiting
for more than 12 hours

220
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:57,722
in Liverpool to book for a
Beatles show were disappointed.

221
00:10:57,722 --> 00:10:59,391
At one time the queue
was stretched

222
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:02,194
for over a mile,
and the police had to seal off

223
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,961
side streets to traffic.

224
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:06,831
Ambulance men dealt
with more than 100 casualties,

225
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:10,335
most of them suffering
from exposure to the rain.

226
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,504
When the tickets ran out,
many young girls

227
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:14,439
burst into tears.

228
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,809
More rain is forecast for...

229
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,344
LEONARD PARKIN: Hello,
London, this is Leonard Parkin

230
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:22,447
calling radio newsreel
from Washington.

231
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:26,184
President Kennedy
and Governor John Conally

232
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:28,386
were shot today from an ambush

233
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:30,588
as President Kennedy's motorcade

234
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:33,325
left the center of Dallas,
where the President

235
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,160
was on a speaking tour.

236
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,962
(somber music)

237
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:41,166
PAUL:
It was disturbing for us.

238
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,236
It was a mixture of all
these sort of strange things,

239
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:49,006
you know,
where the world was at.

240
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:50,375
It was scary.

241
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:57,782
But in all truthfulness,
we were more in our own heads,

242
00:11:57,782 --> 00:12:00,117
you know, being in a band.

243
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:08,726
You know, we were lads.

244
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:11,329
It was like,
this is our journey,

245
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:13,498
and things have been
falling to place

246
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:16,168
outside of our consciousness.

247
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,936
Even the first trip to America.

248
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:20,838
There was no plan.
You could not plan it.

249
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:24,642
PAUL: I'd been very fussy
about America.

250
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:29,381
I'd said, we can't go to America
having failed.

251
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,585
If we ever get a number one
there, then we can really go in,

252
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:34,163
and, you know, we'll be kings.

253
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:36,898
CARROLL JAMES:
So, Marsha Albert has the honor

254
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:38,232

something brand‐new,

255
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:40,568

00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:42,904

00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:50,178

"I Want to Hold Your Hand."

Congratulations, boys.
Number one in America.

270
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,473
"Hold Your Hand,"
it was like ah!

271
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:21,575
We just jumped
on each other's backs,

272
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:24,679
ran around and just
partied round and round

273
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,181

have left the airplane.

289
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:09,791
They're standing
on the stairway,

290
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,060
there's that fabulous hairdo.

291
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,795
And one of them is waving!

292
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:17,732
(announcer shouting excitedly)

293
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:22,737
GEORGE: We all knew
America, all of us.

294
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,639
And we'd been
through all those movies,

295
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,276
whether it was Disneyland,
or Doris Day and Rock Hudson,

296
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:30,812
or whatever, you know,
James Dean, Marilyn,

297
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:33,147
everything was American.

298
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:34,783
MALE REPORTER:
Apparently they're gonna make

299
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:36,550
a concerted effort to get
through into the building.

300
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,286
MAN IN CROWD:
We love you, Beatles!

301
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:39,621
MALE REPORTER: Where,
in just a few moments,

302
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:42,423
a scheduled press
conference will begin.

303
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:47,361
EDDIE IZZARD: America's
always seen as the motherland

304
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:50,531
for British performers,
for any performer in the world.

305
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:52,100
MALE REPORTER:
What about the reports

306
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,367
that you guys
are nothing but a bunch of

307
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:54,602
British Elvis Presleys?

308
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,170
It's not true,
it's not true!

309
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,840
(laughter)

310
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,143
What that is is what
any comedian would want to do.

311
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,745
The trick of dealing
with heckles

312
00:15:03,745 --> 00:15:06,247
is to say the first thing
that comes into your brain.

313
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:08,449
And they'd already
got to that place.

314
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,418
And they could all do it.

315
00:15:10,418 --> 00:15:11,720
MALE REPORTER:
I got a question here.

316
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,054
Are you going to get
a haircut at all?

317
00:15:13,054 --> 00:15:14,823
‐ No.
‐ No thanks.

318
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:16,124
I had one yesterday.

319
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,059
(laughter)

320
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,761
That's no lie.

321
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:23,064
The Beatles were cheeky, kind
of where every kid wants to be,

322
00:15:23,064 --> 00:15:24,598
couple of adults want to be,

323
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:26,768
being able to talk back
to the people

324
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:28,436
who are telling you what to do.

325
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:31,472
They were cheeky, and I think
people in the world like that.

326
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:35,509
It's not aggressive, it's
not nasty, it's just brazen.

327
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:37,178
MALE REPORTER: Why does
your music excite them so much?

328
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:38,747
We don't know, really.

329
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:41,249
If we knew, we'd form
another group and be managers.

330
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:44,352

ED SULLIVAN:
Thank you very much.

335
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:56,230
Now yesterday and today,
our theater's been jammed

336
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,899
with newspapermen and hundreds
of photographers

337
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,567
from all over the nation,
and these veterans agree with me

338
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,736
that the city never
has witnessed the excitement

339
00:16:01,736 --> 00:16:03,938
stirred by these youngsters
from Liverpool

340
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:05,539
who call themselves the Beatles.

341
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:08,609
Now tonight, you're gonna

my brother and mom and I.

353
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,213
It wasn't even a question.

354
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,715
It's just, that's what we'd do.

355
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:50,719

361
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,070
it's a revelation, but it was
like the whole world lit up.

362
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:13,207
Suddenly I felt like
I could be friends with them.

369
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:36,931
People would say to me,
you think you wanna be white?

You like those guys?

371
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:40,835
It's just like, I never
thought of them really

372
00:17:40,835 --> 00:17:44,272
as white guys,
they were the Beatles.

373
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,507
They were colorless.

374
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:49,510
You know, and they
were fucking amazing.

(crowd chattering)

376
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:56,785
The Beatles gave me this idea
that everybody was welcome.

377
00:17:57,986 --> 00:18:01,389
If you weren't the hippest
kid in the neighborhood,

378
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:04,793
it didn't matter because
you could be a Beatle fan,

379
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,327
and I liked that.

380
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:09,698
And that sort of carried
me into these older days

381
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:12,566
where it's like,
I am my own person.

382
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:15,169
I can look the way I wanna,
I can be the way I want,

383
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:22,010
and it's okay, and I got
that specifically from them.

MALE ANNOUNCER:
Fresh after their appearance

385
00:18:23,778 --> 00:18:25,379
on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show,</i>

386
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:27,048
where over half the country
was watching,

387
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:29,851
the four English musical stars
with their pudding bowl haircuts

388
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:32,921
were mobbed by about
4,000 shrieking teenagers

389
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:34,989
when they got
to the Plaza Hotel.

390
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,192
RINGO: We had the
whole floor in the Plaza.

391
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:40,795
(murmuring)

392
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:44,733
And the four of us ended
up in the bathroom,

393
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:48,770
just to get a break
from the incredible pressure.

394
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,504
Let me on it.
Let me on it.

395
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,174
‐ No, let me.
‐ Me!

396
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,743
Me, me!

00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:00,381
‐ No, you.
‐ Me.

400
00:19:00,381 --> 00:19:01,549
‐ After you, sir.
‐ Cut.

401
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,851
RINGO: But we loved it.

402
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,586
To pick up a small
transistor radio‐‐

403
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:07,421
it was the first time
in New York‐‐

404
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:09,624
and hear you comin'
out the radio,

405
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:11,626
it was mind‐blowin'.

406
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:12,994
JOHN LENNON: Hey, this is
John Lennon of the Beatles

407
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:14,963

408
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:16,798
MURRAY THE K: Now,
we just wanna tell everybody,

409
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:18,767
this was the Beatles' station,
they're taking over,

410
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,201
they're telling us what to play.

412
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:24,605
Yes, long distance calling

00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:26,207
May we have his name, please?

414
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:30,411
WOMAN: Their manager's
name is Mr. Brian Epstein.

415
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:33,748
(gentle music)

416
00:19:33,748 --> 00:19:36,550
PAUL: Looking back now,
it was Brian Epstein.

417
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,887
He was the guy
who got us famous, really.

418
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:47,528
Brian was class.

419
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:49,330
That was what Brian was.

420
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,800
He was like Liverpool class.

421
00:19:54,268 --> 00:19:59,373
When Brian was 27, he was
a grownup, and he had a car.

422
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:01,542
(laughs)

423
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:04,012
The Beatles' parents
were Liverpudlian,

424
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:06,480
working class people that
had been through a war.

425
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:10,685
Our playgrounds were bombsites.

426
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:15,089
His parents ran a record shop.

VINTAGE REPORTER:
Seems a funny sort of world

00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:18,592

like you to be in.

How did you get into it?
How did you start?

430
00:20:21,963 --> 00:20:25,499
I heard about them
through a lad

431
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:27,702
who was asking
for a record by them

432
00:20:27,702 --> 00:20:31,105
in one of my stores,
or my family's stores,

433
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,042
in October, 1961.

434
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:38,146
Growing up, my mom always
wanted me to talk proper.

435
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:39,848
You know, all of us, really.

436
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:42,116

like I'm from Liverpool.

Fuck you, I'm tellin' you,
don't give me any hard time.

438
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,490
PAUL: Whereas Brian
was very well‐mannered,

439
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,160
very well‐spoken, so we
felt we could trust him.

EPSTEIN: They were fresh,
and they were honest,

00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:12,380
and they had what I thought
was a sort of presence,

447
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,484
and there's this terrible
vague term, star quality.

448
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,552

PAUL: He was looking
at our stage presence.

454
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:37,939
The early days,
it was clear that he had

455
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:41,409
a vision of us
that was beyond the vision

456
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:43,077
we had of ourselves.

457
00:21:43,077 --> 00:21:46,681
(classical music)

458
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,252
EPSTEIN: Backstage,
they were playing

459
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:52,821
around the clubs in Liverpool.

460
00:21:52,821 --> 00:21:54,689
Rather scruffily dressed,

461
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,725
black leather jackets and jeans,

462
00:21:56,725 --> 00:22:00,194
and rather untidy
stage presentation,

463
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,563
but having great fun.

464
00:22:02,563 --> 00:22:04,165
But I don't think
they would have bothered

465
00:22:04,165 --> 00:22:06,567
to do anything about it,
because young,

466
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:10,705
inexperienced people
are not really very good

467
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,440
at presenting themselves
properly

468
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,844
in the right sort of quarters.

469
00:22:15,844 --> 00:22:19,080
He took us to a tailor...

470
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,082
and we went to this guy,

471
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:23,051
and he made us up suits,
you know.

472
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,488
I'm not sure exactly what time

473
00:22:27,488 --> 00:22:28,823
we'll be back in Washington.

474
00:22:28,823 --> 00:22:30,158
We're going

00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:32,193

00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:49,377
You must be kiddin'
with that question.

Capitol recording stars,

489
00:23:10,732 --> 00:23:12,466
PAUL: You know, the suits.

490
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:14,602
It's the simplest of ideas.

491
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,672
It suddenly made us one person.

492
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:20,541

and good evening, how do you do?

496
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:02,851
We would like to sing a song

497
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:06,554
which we recorded
on an LP that we made,

498
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:07,889
and that's English for album,

499
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:10,058
an album that we made,
and we'd like you,

500
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:11,760
we'd like you, if you would,

501
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,462
to sort of join in
and clap your hands, you know,

502
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:16,197
and stamp your feet.

503
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:21,602
The song's called
"I Saw Her Standing There."

504
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:23,104

00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:18,346
‐ REPORTER: Which one are you?
‐ Eric.

536
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:20,715
Eric?

537
00:27:20,715 --> 00:27:24,518
It's not for me,
it's for Paul.

538
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,088
I'm doing a sh‐‐ (laughs)

539
00:27:27,088 --> 00:27:29,791
Eric, here is
the American public.

540
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,492
‐ I'm John.
‐ You're John?

541
00:27:31,492 --> 00:27:32,994
It was only a joke.

542
00:27:32,994 --> 00:27:34,395
Yes, well John, here
is the American public.

543
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:36,564
40 million American viewers
staring you‐‐

544
00:27:36,564 --> 00:27:38,800
‐ Only looks like one man to me.
‐ Staring you right in the face.

545
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,234
Oh, it's the camera man.

546
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:41,636
What is your impression
of the American public?

547
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:42,771
You've been here
for a while now.

548
00:27:42,771 --> 00:27:43,872
They are the wildest.

549
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,406
‐ Why?
‐ I don't know.

550
00:27:45,406 --> 00:27:48,509
Tonight was,
the mob was ridiculous.

551
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:51,312
All those 8,000 people
all shouting at once,

552
00:27:51,312 --> 00:27:53,014
and we were trying to shout
louder than them

553
00:27:53,014 --> 00:27:54,683
with microphones,
and we still couldn't beat 'em.

554
00:27:54,683 --> 00:27:57,118
Was America something like
what you though it would be?

555
00:27:57,118 --> 00:27:58,753
No, nothing like. We thought it
would be much quieter.

556
00:27:58,753 --> 00:28:00,955
We thought, you know,
we'd have to grow on everybody,

557
00:28:00,955 --> 00:28:03,157
and everybody
seems to know us all

558
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:06,194
as if we've been here
for years, it's great.

559
00:28:06,194 --> 00:28:08,062
I love the Beatles for them
and I'll always love them,

560
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:10,799
even when I'm
a 105‐year‐old grandmother,

561
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,266
I'll love 'em,
and Paul McCartney,

562
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:14,803
if you are listening,
Adrian from Brooklyn

563
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:16,805
loves you with all her heart.

564
00:28:16,805 --> 00:28:18,472
(cheering)

565
00:28:18,472 --> 00:28:20,742
PAUL: It's a romantic
thing to us, being in America,

566
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,277
playing to our American fans.

567
00:28:23,277 --> 00:28:26,180
‐ Ringo has a sexy nose!
‐ A sexy nose?

568
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,749
George has got
sexy eyelashes.

569
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:28,783
Who has?

570
00:28:28,783 --> 00:28:30,118
George has got sexy eyelashes.

571
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:32,987
‐ Which one is George?
‐ That one.

572
00:28:32,987 --> 00:28:35,356
He's got sexy eyelashes.

573
00:28:35,356 --> 00:28:36,625
(screaming)

574
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:39,460
PAUL: The very
earliest records were all

575
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:43,665
pleas to the fans, and it
was all personal articles.

576
00:28:43,665 --> 00:28:46,901
JOHN: In the early days,
we didn't count lyrics at all,

577
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:49,771
as long as it had some vague
theme.

578
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:53,441
She loves you and he loves
him and they love each other.

579
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:56,945

It's all direct,
it's kind of conscious.

584
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:12,593
We were actually
appealing to girls.

585
00:29:12,593 --> 00:29:15,063
We're young boys,
we're appealing to girls

586
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:16,831
to get our fan base.

587
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:20,434
♪ You ♪

‐ (laughs)
‐ Go on.

590
00:29:25,573 --> 00:29:29,077
You, yourselves, you write
very good songs. Don't you?

591
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:30,845
Oh, thank you, thank you.

592
00:29:30,845 --> 00:29:31,880
WOMAN:
How do you write songs?

593
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,047
(laughter)

594
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:35,283
Well, you know,
it just depends.

595
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:36,818
Sometimes we write them
on old pianos,

596
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,486
and anything
that's lying around.

597
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:41,923
Normally we sit down
and try and bash one out.

598
00:29:41,923 --> 00:29:44,292
But then again,
there's no formula,

599
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:46,527
'cause he can come up
with one one day,

600
00:29:46,527 --> 00:29:52,133
completely finished, we still
say we both wrote it though.

♪ I got ever reason
on Earth to be mad

602
00:29:56,838 --> 00:30:01,743
♪ 'Cause I just lost

603
00:30:01,743 --> 00:30:03,444
JOHN: We got a single
every three months

604
00:30:03,444 --> 00:30:05,747
and we'd have be writing
literally in the hotel

605
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:07,548
or in the van.

606
00:30:07,548 --> 00:30:08,917
We wrote on the road.

607
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,084
Mainly me and John.

608
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:12,253
George developed
as a writer later,

609
00:30:12,253 --> 00:30:13,822
and became
an unbelievable writer,

610
00:30:13,822 --> 00:30:16,324
but at the beginning
it was mainly me and John.

611
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:19,861
So we'd be in a hotel
room with two twin beds,

612
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:23,965
and he'd have his acoustic
guitar, I'd have mine,

613
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:25,599
sit opposite each other,
and because

614
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,101
I was left‐handed,
he was right‐handed.

615
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:28,903
It was like
looking in the mirror.

616
00:30:28,903 --> 00:30:33,274
And we'd just start something
and ricochet of each other.

617
00:30:33,274 --> 00:30:36,010
He'd do a line, I'd do a line,
we'd just write it down.

618
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,646
And when we were finished,

619
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,580
we didn't have a manuscript,
but we had a sheet of paper

620
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,184
with the words,
and we remembered the chords.

621
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:46,821
(singing happily)

622
00:30:46,821 --> 00:30:49,423
Yeah, it's number one
in <i>Cashbox</i> and <i>Billboard.</i>

623
00:30:49,423 --> 00:30:53,494
Yeah, you know,
in New York, three records,

624
00:30:53,494 --> 00:30:55,129
"Please Please Me,"
"She Loves You,"

625
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:56,931
and "I Want to Hold Your
Hand" are all number one.

626
00:30:56,931 --> 00:30:58,833
(laughter)

627
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:01,302
Paul, John, yeah.
Thanks.

628
00:31:01,302 --> 00:31:03,571
But we'll see you, you know,
in two weeks, I suppose.

629
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:06,007
(harmonium music)

630
00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:13,314
My relationship
with John was very close.

631
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:17,385
Musically, you know, we looked
after each other, really.

632
00:31:17,385 --> 00:31:19,888
It's like someone you kind
of looked up to a little bit.

633
00:31:19,888 --> 00:31:24,192
When I first met him,
I talked to people in my life,

634
00:31:24,192 --> 00:31:25,393
and they say,
what do you like to do,

635
00:31:25,393 --> 00:31:27,328
What are your hobbies
and stuff?

636
00:31:27,328 --> 00:31:28,496
And I sort of said,
I like songwriting,

637
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:30,131
I've written a couple of songs.

638
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:32,300
And they'd all go,
Oh, yeah, great.

639
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,435
What did you think
about the football?

640
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,905
And I'd go, oh, okay,
nobody interested.

641
00:31:36,905 --> 00:31:40,608
When I said that to John,
he said, oh, so am I.

642
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:43,477
I go, wow, wait a minute,
big connection here.

643
00:31:43,477 --> 00:31:46,280
I'd never met anyone
who'd written songs.

644
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,217
So that's how we started.

645
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:51,786
I think it's something like
just short of 300 songs

646
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,321
John and I wrote together.

647
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:56,524

in unison)

00:32:27,622 --> 00:32:31,693
There was that pride thing,
they were from Liverpool.

653
00:32:31,693 --> 00:32:33,027
And nine years old.

654
00:32:33,027 --> 00:32:35,563
When your favorite group
is the Beatles,

655
00:32:35,563 --> 00:32:37,531
it is like supporting
a winning football team,

656
00:32:37,531 --> 00:32:40,468
because they just keep
winning the cup.

657
00:32:40,468 --> 00:32:42,671
You'd wait all week
to hear the hit parade show

658
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:44,806
so that you would hear,
for sure, the Beatles' song,

659
00:32:44,806 --> 00:32:46,607
because they would
get to number one.

660
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:49,944
Top British vocal group,
top four records of the year,

00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:32,353
they were loving it.

674
00:33:32,353 --> 00:33:34,522
And they loved us
wherever we went.

675
00:33:34,522 --> 00:33:36,758
It was a surprise to us,
too.

676
00:33:36,758 --> 00:33:40,128
MAN: John, Paul,
George o Ringo. The Beatles!

677

(screaming)

678
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:49,270
It was a different
kind of fame,

679
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,571
because we didn't have
social media,

680
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,974
we didn't have
satellite television,

681
00:33:52,974 --> 00:33:54,242
and yet the word would spread

682
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:55,810
that this group would be coming.

683
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,446
Once it was big in one country,
it got bigger in the next.

684
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:03,752
JOHN: Australia,
there was more people

685
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,687
come to see us there
than anywhere.

686
00:34:05,687 --> 00:34:07,155
I mean, it looked like,
I think,

687
00:34:07,155 --> 00:34:09,523
the whole of Australia
was there.

688
00:34:09,523 --> 00:34:10,859
MALE REPORTER:
Along the nine‐mile route

689
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:12,727
from Adelaide Airport
to the city,

690
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:16,497
almost a quarter of a million
people lined the street.

691
00:34:16,497 --> 00:34:19,600
My picture of it,
there was a ship

692
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,203
going to discover
the New World.

693
00:34:22,203 --> 00:34:24,438
And the Beatles

And of course,
next most extraordinary thing

00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:04,545
is the fantasy version
of the Beatles from '64,

710
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:06,347
you know, <i>Hard Day's Night.</i>

711

717
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:27,601
No, definitely not,
but we enjoyed making the film,

718
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:29,804
and especially
with the director.

719
00:35:29,804 --> 00:35:31,372
The director was great,
you see,

720
00:35:31,372 --> 00:35:34,008
and it made it
much easier for us.

721
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,644
United Artists said,

722
00:35:35,644 --> 00:35:38,012
"You ought to be able
to make a good, quick,

723
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:40,448
low‐budget film with them,

in the cinemas by July,

731
00:36:00,134 --> 00:36:02,937
is that sense of protection.

732
00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:06,841
Being protective when they had
to be supporting one another

733
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:08,576

about <i>Hard Day's Night,</i>

736
00:36:14,582 --> 00:36:16,150
and everything you
heard about the Beatles

737
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,853
is the lack of self‐pity,
that we had a feeling

738
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:21,255
they were adoring what
was happening to them,

739
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:24,659

a completely virtuous circle.

of the dangers of being
with the Beatles.

812
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,961
When we drove up
to the stage door,

813
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:22,563
the Beatles were
almost crushed completely

814
00:40:22,563 --> 00:40:24,966
by youngsters
who will mash themselves

815
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:28,369
against the wall,
broke about 50 windows,

816
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:33,241
throwed rocks, jelly beans,
undershirts, sandals.

817
00:40:33,241 --> 00:40:35,009
The situation
was one of sheer havoc,

818
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:39,313
even though the police
did their best to stop it.

819
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:43,284
The first couple of days,
there was a bewilderment.

820
00:40:43,284 --> 00:40:44,919
There was a wondrousness.

821
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:46,287
Is this really happening to us?

822
00:40:46,287 --> 00:40:48,422
One girl stuck
her hand through the window

823
00:40:48,422 --> 00:40:49,958
and grabbed at my face.

824
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:53,094
I'm okay, don't worry,
people, I'm all right.

825
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:55,930
Four cities later,
in Vancouver, British Columbia,

826
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:59,934

831
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,029
We have to cut it short
unless you move back.

832
00:41:28,029 --> 00:41:30,665
They're very worried about
the situation in the front.

833
00:41:30,665 --> 00:41:33,768
Back, back, back.

834
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:37,138
240 kids wound up
in the hospital.

835

None of the police
in any of these cities

836
00:41:40,274 --> 00:41:41,976
were prepared for this.

837
00:41:41,976 --> 00:41:43,845
Nobody was prepared for this.

838
00:41:43,845 --> 00:41:46,414
Wouldn't you say, Derek,
that police departments

839
00:41:46,414 --> 00:41:48,850
don't realize how bad it is?

840
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,018
DEREK TAYLOR:
I think that's true.

841
00:41:50,018 --> 00:41:51,920
They've all seen crowds before.

842
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,022
I mean, they all say,
we know our own people,

843
00:41:54,022 --> 00:41:55,589
we know the police potential,

844
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:57,158
and we're going
to be able to handle it.

845
00:41:57,158 --> 00:41:59,027
But what they've never seen
is a Beatle crowd.

846
00:41:59,027 --> 00:42:01,730
This is the biggest thing
that's ever happened.

847
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,564
There's no question about it.

848
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:04,933
It's like nothing before.

surrounded by lots of girls

873

I was in love with John.

'cause I had curly hair.

they would see me,
along with 15,000 girls.

We're on our way to Cincinnati.

893
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:57,211
They had a wild one yesterday.

894
00:43:57,211 --> 00:44:00,114
on his exciting,
25‐city coast‐to‐coast tour.

895

Atlantic City, Philadelphia,

896
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:04,085
about the crowds
at Indianapolis.

897
00:44:04,085 --> 00:44:06,354
Back and forth again. The stage
set for Milwaukee tonight.

898
00:44:06,354 --> 00:44:08,022
You can hear the buzz
and excitement

899
00:44:08,022 --> 00:44:09,457
here at the Chicago
Amphitheater.

900
00:44:09,457 --> 00:44:11,025
Now in Detroit, Michigan.

901
00:44:11,025 --> 00:44:12,961
The Beatles really shook
up the crowd in Toronto.

902
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:14,428
In Montreal, Canada.

903
00:44:14,428 --> 00:44:16,197
Hi, this is Larry Kane,
travelling with the Beatles.

904
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:19,267
Let me explain to you
the type of feeling

905
00:44:19,267 --> 00:44:21,970
that you get
after 15 performances

906
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,372
watching the Beatles
in action,

907
00:44:24,372 --> 00:44:26,207
and watching the crowds.

908
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:27,942
It's a chilling feeling
inside

909
00:44:27,942 --> 00:44:29,844
because you know
you are experiencing

910
00:44:29,844 --> 00:44:33,514
a phenomenon that is
the only one of its kind

911
00:44:33,514 --> 00:44:35,950
in this century thus far,
and it probably

912
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:37,418
will go down in history
as the greatest

00:44:37,418 --> 00:44:43,191

00:44:43,191 --> 00:44:46,995

Thank you!

Remember, too, that in 1964,

926
00:45:13,354 --> 00:45:15,857
there were riots
throughout the South

927
00:45:15,857 --> 00:45:19,427
because of
the civil rights movement.

928
00:45:19,427 --> 00:45:22,496
You started to feel
a social change happening.

929
00:45:22,496 --> 00:45:25,133
‐ Civil rights or civil war!
‐ This is Larry Kane.

930
00:45:25,133 --> 00:45:26,735
The big question mark
still with Jacksonville

931
00:45:26,735 --> 00:45:29,537
not knowing whether
they will be able to perform.

932
00:45:29,537 --> 00:45:32,406
I had received a report from
my station that the Gator Bowl

933
00:45:32,406 --> 00:45:34,608
in Jacksonville
was gonna be segregated,

934
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:37,211
so I mentioned it
to them in the interview.

935
00:45:37,211 --> 00:45:39,681
What about this comment
that I heard about

936
00:45:39,681 --> 00:45:44,252
concerning racial integration
at the various performances?

937
00:45:44,252 --> 00:45:46,054
PAUL: We don't like it
if there's any segregation

938
00:45:46,054 --> 00:45:48,422
or anything, because
it just seems mad to me.

939
00:45:48,422 --> 00:45:50,224
LARRY: And I could see
Brian at the corner of the room

940
00:45:50,224 --> 00:45:51,592
goin' like, oh my God.

941
00:45:51,592 --> 00:45:53,394
Well, you're gonna play
Jacksonville, Florida.

942
00:45:53,394 --> 00:45:55,630
Do you anticipate any kind
of difference in that opinion?

943
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:56,965
PAUL: I don't know, really,

944
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:59,167
it'd be a bit silly
to segregate people

945
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,602
'cause you know, it's
really stupid, isn't it?

946
00:46:01,602 --> 00:46:04,072
You can't treat other
human beings like animals.

947
00:46:04,072 --> 00:46:05,439
GEORGE: That's the way
we all feel.

948
00:46:05,439 --> 00:46:07,075
PAUL: That's the way
we all feel,

949
00:46:07,075 --> 00:46:08,542
and a lot of people
in England feel that way,

950
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:10,178
you know, because there's
never any segregation

951
00:46:10,178 --> 00:46:11,746
in concerts in England,
and in fact if there was,

952
00:46:11,746 --> 00:46:13,615
we wouldn't play 'em, you know.

953
00:46:15,917 --> 00:46:17,418
During that same summer,

954
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:20,488
we had the three civil
rights workers in the South

955
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:25,093
who were missing,
and then found dead.

956
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:29,898
I was 15,

957
00:46:29,898 --> 00:46:33,301
living in segregation.

958
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:36,137
It was an apartheid
that's probably difficult

959
00:46:36,137 --> 00:46:38,840
for a lot of people
to even picture.

960
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,411
The only white person
I would even have contact with

961
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:47,616
was a salesman who would
come into the community.

962
00:46:47,616 --> 00:46:50,852
It was ripe for something
different I think,

963
00:46:50,852 --> 00:46:57,558
at the time I heard that
the Beatles were coming to town.

964
00:46:57,558 --> 00:46:58,693
All of them, by the way,

965
00:46:58,693 --> 00:47:00,729
were very emphatic
about Jacksonville.

966
00:47:00,729 --> 00:47:03,264
They said that if there
was going to be segregation

967
00:47:03,264 --> 00:47:05,466
of any kind, we're not going.

968
00:47:05,466 --> 00:47:08,937
We play to people,
that's what we did.

969
00:47:08,937 --> 00:47:11,105
We didn't play to, like,
those people,

970
00:47:11,105 --> 00:47:12,907
or that people,
you know what I mean?

971
00:47:12,907 --> 00:47:15,710
We just played to people.

972
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:17,912
It was amazing
that the four of them,

973
00:47:17,912 --> 00:47:20,048
young men seeing the world,

974
00:47:20,048 --> 00:47:23,084
started to act up
and blow back on this

975
00:47:23,084 --> 00:47:25,754
very, very hot
and sensitive issue

976
00:47:25,754 --> 00:47:30,158
knowing that it would really
irritate a lot of Americans.

977
00:47:30,158 --> 00:47:33,628
We had to all decide,
we agreed on a thing,

978
00:47:33,628 --> 00:47:35,296
before we'd do it.

979
00:47:35,296 --> 00:47:38,299
That is one of the classic
things about the Beatles.

980
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:42,003
Four votes had to be carried

981
00:47:42,003 --> 00:47:44,806
for any idea to go trough.

982
00:47:44,806 --> 00:47:46,507
JOHN: Instead of going
for an individual thing,

983
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:50,178
we went for the strongest
format, for equals.

984
00:47:50,178 --> 00:47:53,014
That was one thing
to be said about us,

985
00:47:53,014 --> 00:47:56,084
we were very, very close
to each other.

986
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:58,052
We'd always stick together.

987
00:47:58,052 --> 00:48:01,389
PAUL: We all had to agree,
so there is a strong decision.

988
00:48:01,389 --> 00:48:02,390
You know,
the proof's in the puddin',

989
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:04,225
it worked really well.

990
00:48:04,225 --> 00:48:07,629
(rock music)

991
00:48:07,629 --> 00:48:11,599
It was my first concert,
and I went by myself.

992
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,535
The only catch in my breath
that I got

993
00:48:14,535 --> 00:48:17,471
was when I went to my seat,
and there were

994
00:48:17,471 --> 00:48:19,573
all those other people
around me,

995
00:48:19,573 --> 00:48:22,576
and I still can feel that
to this day,

996
00:48:22,576 --> 00:48:25,079
that there were all these
white people around,

997
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:27,148
but I remember standing up
with everybody,

998
00:48:27,148 --> 00:48:31,620
and just yelling
as loud as I could

999
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,487
and singin' along.

1000
00:48:42,563 --> 00:48:45,767
That was
the first experience I had

1001
00:48:45,767 --> 00:48:47,468
where it was possible
to be around people

1002
00:48:47,468 --> 00:48:50,038
who were different,
and at least for a while,

1003
00:48:50,038 --> 00:48:52,140
those differences
could disappear.

1004
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,441
(cheering)

1005
00:48:53,441 --> 00:48:55,243

1010

The people
who ran the Gator Bowl

1011
00:49:04,986 --> 00:49:07,255
integrated
for the first time ever,

1012
00:49:07,255 --> 00:49:09,390
which from my historical
perspective and study,

1013
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:13,728
ended all that in most of
the big stadiums in the South.

1014
00:49:13,728 --> 00:49:15,296
And the next eight days
are probably

1015
00:49:15,296 --> 00:49:16,831
the most grueling of the tour.

1016
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:19,901
It looks like the Beatles
are holding up strong.

1017
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:22,737
Every night on the airplane
they would go up,

1018
00:49:22,737 --> 00:49:26,340
up to the front of the plane
where the opening acts were,

1019
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,643
and kneel down and talk to them.

1020
00:49:28,643 --> 00:49:31,279
Every single night,
they would ask them

1021
00:49:31,279 --> 00:49:33,181
if they were okay,
because they were

1022
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:34,716
being ignored by the crowd.

1023
00:49:34,716 --> 00:49:37,551
This is Larry Kane
traveling with the Beatles,

1024
00:49:37,551 --> 00:49:39,253
and they're looking forward
to going back to England,

1025
00:49:39,253 --> 00:49:40,722
because they'll be there
for two weeks,

1026
00:49:40,722 --> 00:49:43,191
where they'll record records,
and do music,

1027
00:49:43,191 --> 00:49:44,392
and that's believe it or not,

1028
00:49:44,392 --> 00:49:46,527
another month‐long tour,
this time

1029
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:48,963
in their own country,
sometimes just by bus,

1030
00:49:48,963 --> 00:49:51,733
and that's pretty hard.

1031
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:55,203
My mother died
in the summer of 1964,

1032
00:49:55,203 --> 00:49:56,838
and somehow or another,
it got to them

1033
00:49:56,838 --> 00:49:58,640
that she had passed away,

1034
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,711
and Paul and John
both consoled me.

1035
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:05,714
PAUL: John and I,
we both lost our mothers.

1036
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:08,917
Mine had died of cancer,
and his had died

1037
00:50:08,917 --> 00:50:10,652
in a terrible road accident,

1038
00:50:10,652 --> 00:50:13,487
so that kind of
pulled us together a lot.

1039
00:50:13,487 --> 00:50:14,789
You know, bein' teenagers,
we each needed

1040
00:50:14,789 --> 00:50:16,958
to do something
that would get us away

1041
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:21,495
from this tragedy, and so
songwriting was it, really.

1042
00:50:21,495 --> 00:50:26,000
♪ 'Cause I couldn't
stand the pain ♪

1043
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,903
They were very, very sensitive
to other people's feelings.

1044
00:50:28,903 --> 00:50:30,604
All four of them.

1045
00:50:30,604 --> 00:50:33,908
They were intelligent people
who cared about other people,

1046
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:36,544
who had a sense of themselves.

1047
00:50:36,544 --> 00:50:38,479
They also liked
making fun of me.

1048
00:50:38,479 --> 00:50:40,081
John, last night
you were very kind,

1049
00:50:40,081 --> 00:50:42,617
and Derek was very kind to
invite us up to see the movie,

1050
00:50:42,617 --> 00:50:44,185
which we have seen twice.

1051
00:50:44,185 --> 00:50:45,519
JOHN: I never
invited him at all.

1052
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:47,488
I just saw him sittin' there
listenin'.

1053
00:50:47,488 --> 00:50:48,522
LARRY: Well, anyway.
(laughs)

1054
00:50:48,522 --> 00:50:51,125
JOHN: Only kiddin', Larry.

1055
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:52,460
LARRY:
This has been Larry Kane

1056
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,796
traveling with the Beatles.

1057
00:51:04,572 --> 00:51:06,474
It's extraordinary,
when you think about it

1058
00:51:06,474 --> 00:51:10,411
that they were touring
in this kind of circus of life.

1059
00:51:10,411 --> 00:51:12,947
The sort of madness
of all that jamboree

1060
00:51:12,947 --> 00:51:15,416
of excitement and hysteria.

1061
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:17,986
And yet,
they were able to express

1062
00:51:17,986 --> 00:51:20,722
the way they were feeling,
the weirdness of it,

1063
00:51:20,722 --> 00:51:23,992
because inside
those Beatles suits,

1064
00:51:23,992 --> 00:51:25,927
were composers.

1065
00:51:25,927 --> 00:51:27,161
They were writers.

1066
00:51:27,161 --> 00:51:28,930
(indistinct voices)

1067
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,003
RINGO: Comin' in the wrong,
half way through the song.

1068
00:51:35,003 --> 00:51:37,806
Well was it a 12‐bar?

1069
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:39,674
(guitar playing)

1070
00:51:39,674 --> 00:51:41,743
The studio was like
our little haven.

1071
00:51:41,743 --> 00:51:45,814
Once we got back there,
we knew we could experiment.

1072
00:51:50,952 --> 00:51:52,453
Hear ourselves.

1073
00:51:52,453 --> 00:51:56,357
And we would write songs
that would be a progression,

1074
00:51:56,357 --> 00:51:58,793
and that would be fun to record.

1075
00:51:58,793 --> 00:52:03,231
(amplifier static)

1076
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:04,933
GEORGE MARTIN:
Brian Epstein and I

1077
00:52:04,933 --> 00:52:08,102
worked together very closely
planning their future.

1078
00:52:08,102 --> 00:52:09,838
We agreed that we should put out

1079
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:14,275
a single every three months,
and an album every six months.

1080
00:52:14,275 --> 00:52:18,613
♪ Baby's good to me,
you know she's happy as can be

1081
00:52:18,613 --> 00:52:21,983
♪ You know, she said so

1082
00:52:21,983 --> 00:52:27,355
♪ I'm in love with her
and I feel fine ♪

1083
00:52:27,355 --> 00:52:28,923
DEREK TAYLOR:
I was under pressure

1084
00:52:28,923 --> 00:52:31,592
because I got sucked
into the time difference.

1085
00:52:31,592 --> 00:52:33,261
I would say to Brian,
you know,

1086
00:52:33,261 --> 00:52:36,130
I need more time in the studio,
and he would dole out time,

1087
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:38,633
like giving scraps to a mouse.

1088
00:52:38,633 --> 00:52:41,202
One of the great things
about our recording

1089
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:42,737
was the schedule.

1090
00:52:42,737 --> 00:52:44,673
You go in at 10 o'clock
in the morning,

1091
00:52:44,673 --> 00:52:47,175
tune up, have a ciggy,
have a cup of tea or something,

1092
00:52:47,175 --> 00:52:51,112
and then John and I, mainly,
would present the song

1093
00:52:51,112 --> 00:52:53,481
that we'd written to everyone.

1094
00:52:53,481 --> 00:52:55,884
(guitar music playing)

1095
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:04,292
Just go through it, anyway.

1096
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:06,995
Make mistakes,
just to practice it.

1097
00:53:06,995 --> 00:53:08,596
Try to remember,
John, and if I don't,

1098
00:53:08,596 --> 00:53:12,000
well, it's just too bad,
okay?

1099
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,501
Is it just me and you?

1100
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:15,336
One, two, three, four.

1101
00:53:15,336 --> 00:53:20,441
(singing)

1102
00:53:20,441 --> 00:53:23,712
(overlapping,
indistinct remarks)

1103
00:53:23,712 --> 00:53:25,714
One, two, three, four.

1104
00:53:25,714 --> 00:53:29,417

00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,589

♪ Yes you know it's true ♪

1107
00:53:38,893 --> 00:53:42,430
Ringo'd tap along,
George just sussed the chords,

1108
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,598
and then George Martin
would go, oh

1109
00:53:44,598 --> 00:53:46,400
that's half nice,
that's marvelous.

1110
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,802
It'd take about 20 minutes
to do that.

1111
00:53:47,802 --> 00:53:50,104
♪ Hold me, love me ♪

1112
00:53:50,104 --> 00:53:51,572
PAUL: George,
what did it sound like

1113
00:53:51,572 --> 00:53:53,241
with the base
doin' a funny thing?

1114
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:55,744
Did it sound any good, or did it
sound just a lovely crap?

1115
00:53:55,744 --> 00:54:00,448
(indistinct responses)

1116
00:54:00,448 --> 00:54:01,482
GEORGE MARTIN: Take three.

1117
00:54:01,482 --> 00:54:03,084
GEORGE: One, two three four.

1118
00:54:03,084 --> 00:54:06,721
(singing)

1119
00:54:06,721 --> 00:54:08,389
At the very beginning,
George Martin

1120
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:12,393
was the only man that could
press the button to record.

1121
00:54:12,393 --> 00:54:16,665
We'd just play it and do it,
oh did you get that, George?

1122
00:54:16,665 --> 00:54:18,332
GEORGE MARTIN:
I'm giving up here.

1123
00:54:18,332 --> 00:54:20,769
‐ JOHN: Wonderful, Paul.
‐ GEORGE MARTIN: Very lovely.

1124
00:54:20,769 --> 00:54:23,705
PAUL: Ah, keep that one.
Mark it fab.

1125
00:54:23,705 --> 00:54:26,207
Do you want to have a listen
before we go on to the next one?

1126
00:54:26,207 --> 00:54:27,241
(whirring)

1127
00:54:27,241 --> 00:54:29,077
George had recorded The Goons.

1128
00:54:29,077 --> 00:54:30,979
That was like a cult thing
that we all loved,

1129
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:32,280
and we all knew it.

1130
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,650
GEORGE MARTIN: At that time
I was a comedy producer

1131
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,919
recording Spike Milligan
and Peter Sellers,

1132
00:54:37,919 --> 00:54:40,354
and a lot of English
comedy actors.

1133
00:54:40,354 --> 00:54:41,923
So he picked up our humor,

1134
00:54:41,923 --> 00:54:45,459
he picked up our camaraderie,
you know.

1135
00:54:45,459 --> 00:54:49,197
We thought, he's mad,
we love him.

1136
00:54:49,197 --> 00:54:51,132
JOHN: We'll just have
to have a go of it, you see.

1137
00:54:51,132 --> 00:54:52,466
GEORGE MARTIN: Oh, you're
a right keeper, aren't you?

1138
00:54:52,466 --> 00:54:54,568
JOHN: I know.

1139
00:54:54,568 --> 00:54:57,739
On the early record,
George Martin was a god.

1140
00:54:57,739 --> 00:54:59,974
GEORGE MARTIN: To begin with,
I was very much in charge.

1141
00:54:59,974 --> 00:55:02,744
I was the kind of schoolmaster
teaching them everything,

1142
00:55:02,744 --> 00:55:04,746
and they had to do
what I told them.

1143
00:55:04,746 --> 00:55:06,615
PAUL: You had
one‐and‐a‐half hours

1144
00:55:06,615 --> 00:55:09,250
from 10:30
to finish that song.

1145
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,251
Boom.

1146
00:55:10,251 --> 00:55:11,720
So that focused you.

1147
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,487
That was a great discipline.

1148
00:55:13,487 --> 00:55:15,256
(whirring)

1149
00:55:15,256 --> 00:55:17,025
‐ Hit it, Declan.
‐ JOHN: We'll do it again.

1150
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:19,027
PAUL: We'll try
and get it good, too.

1151
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:20,629
GEORGE MARTIN:
I'm just gonna start recording.

1152
00:55:20,629 --> 00:55:22,797
John, whenever you like,
the red light's on.

1153
00:55:22,797 --> 00:55:26,635
Every minute of the day,
someone wanted something.

1154
00:55:26,635 --> 00:55:29,503
You know, drive to EMI
to do a record.

1155
00:55:29,503 --> 00:55:35,644
Down here to SoHo
to do a photo shoot.

1156
00:55:35,644 --> 00:55:38,279
Ride back to do some TV show.

1157
00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:42,050

00:55:53,094 --> 00:55:55,063
End up in a nightclub.

1164
00:55:55,063 --> 00:55:58,499
We were just doin'
four or five things a day,

1165
00:55:58,499 --> 00:55:59,868
but we had each other.

1166
00:55:59,868 --> 00:56:01,803
And we brought that
to the music.

1167
00:56:01,803 --> 00:56:03,037

♪ Hold me, love me ♪

1173
00:56:17,852 --> 00:56:19,487
The thing
about the scale is that

1174
00:56:19,487 --> 00:56:22,356
writing lots of songs
is not particularly difficult.

1175
00:56:22,356 --> 00:56:23,858
Volume is not the thing.

1176
00:56:23,858 --> 00:56:25,026
The extraordinary thing
about the Beatles

1177
00:56:25,026 --> 00:56:27,328
is the amount of great songs.

1178
00:56:27,328 --> 00:56:28,930
Schubert wrote about 800 songs,

1179
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:31,666
of which probably 100 are
absolutely beautiful melodies.

1180
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:33,434
The other 700, pretty good.

1181
00:56:33,434 --> 00:56:36,337
The only comparison with that
kind of level of melody

1182
00:56:36,337 --> 00:56:37,839
may be Mozart.

1183
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,574
Very, very, high volume
of very good melodies.

1184
00:56:40,574 --> 00:56:42,410
You have to wait
a long time, then,

1185
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:44,979
'til you get someone
who's up in the hundreds,

1186
00:56:44,979 --> 00:56:46,547
and that's when
you hit the Beatles.

1187
00:56:46,547 --> 00:56:48,950
Which is why I think you can
compare them in some ways,

1188
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:50,819

volume of the invention.

We'd enjoyed very much
doing <i>Hard Day's Night.</i>

1214
00:58:15,269 --> 00:58:20,308
We'd kinda taken it
seriously, but the film <i>Help!</i>

1215
00:58:20,308 --> 00:58:22,877
We were kind of
pretty disinterested.

1216
00:58:22,877 --> 00:58:25,680
You know, we were now
doing it again,

1217
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,617
and so it couldn't be quite
as exciting as the first time.

1218
00:58:28,617 --> 00:58:30,418
Nothing is.

1219
00:58:30,418 --> 00:58:33,387
(organ music)

1220
00:58:33,387 --> 00:58:35,857
The main thing I remember,
we all had meetings

1221
00:58:35,857 --> 00:58:39,728
about tax structure,
and they would sort of say,

1222
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:43,597
oh you gotta put your money
in the Bahamas or somewhere.

1223
00:58:43,597 --> 00:58:46,067
So where we were asked
about the film,

1224
00:58:46,067 --> 00:58:48,202
we'd say, can we go
to the Bahamas?

1225
00:58:48,202 --> 00:58:50,839
We were told, you're
gonna film in the Bahamas.

1226
00:58:50,839 --> 00:58:52,040

1229

In 1965,
they invited me to Nassau

1230
00:59:11,392 --> 00:59:13,461
to watch them film
the movie <i>Help!</i>

1231
00:59:13,461 --> 00:59:16,631
I walked into the house, and I
saw something very unusual.

1232
00:59:16,631 --> 00:59:20,168
They were all high on marijuana.

1233
00:59:20,168 --> 00:59:21,936
And I'd never seen this before.

1234
00:59:21,936 --> 00:59:24,438
‐ Hey, Paul. How you doin'?
‐ JOHN: Hello, Larry.

1235
00:59:24,438 --> 00:59:26,975
‐ LARRY: Good to see you again.
‐ PAUL: Lovely to see you again.

1236
00:59:26,975 --> 00:59:32,781
LARRY: Hey, John.
How are you doin'?

1237
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:34,448
(laughs)

1238
00:59:34,448 --> 00:59:37,018
What is this
"anything can happen" business?

1239
00:59:43,124 --> 00:59:44,993
‐ Thanks a lot.
‐ JOHN: Anything, Larry.

1240
00:59:44,993 --> 00:59:46,494
LARRY:
We'll be talking to you.

1241
00:59:46,494 --> 00:59:48,329
(John laughs)

1242
00:59:48,329 --> 00:59:52,667
In all truthfulness,
we spent a lot of that film

1243
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:54,368
slightly stoned.

1244
00:59:54,368 --> 00:59:57,071
(squeaking)

1245
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,118
Things were spiraling
like crazy during <i>Help!</i>

1246
01:00:10,118 --> 01:00:12,887
There were people coming
in with contracts for

1247
01:00:12,887 --> 01:00:16,324
bubble gum royalties
and being condescending.

1248
01:00:16,324 --> 01:00:18,860
And then the press
were getting aggressive.

1249
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,428
They owned all of us.

1250
01:00:20,428 --> 01:00:22,163
JOHN: There's
no switching off.

1251
01:00:22,163 --> 01:00:23,698
The elevator man
wants a little piece of you

1252
01:00:23,698 --> 01:00:25,199
on your way back to your room.

1253
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:28,302
The maid wants a piece
of you back at the hotel.

1254
01:00:28,302 --> 01:00:30,204
I don't mean sexually,
I mean a piece of your time

1255
01:00:30,204 --> 01:00:31,239
and your energy.

1256
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:32,473
And it's like a politician.

1257
01:00:32,473 --> 01:00:35,043
You're on 24 hours a day.

1258
01:00:35,043 --> 01:00:37,145
LARRY: I think that
John got fed up first.

1259
01:00:37,145 --> 01:00:39,580
He became agitated
or frustrated

1260
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:44,886
about what was being written,
particularly from 1965 onward.

1261
01:00:44,886 --> 01:00:48,122
Richard Lester had said,
we need a song.

1262
01:00:48,122 --> 01:00:50,091
And John started it.

1263
01:00:50,091 --> 01:00:53,928
So by the time I came
to see him, he had a lot of it.

1264
01:00:53,928 --> 01:00:55,864
And it said to me,
you know, this is

1265
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:57,632
kind of autobiographical.

1266
01:00:57,632 --> 01:01:00,368
You know, "When I was younger,
so much younger than today."

1267
01:01:00,368 --> 01:01:04,806
I knew what he meant, and I
knew now he was more insecure,

1268
01:01:04,806 --> 01:01:06,741
'cause we were all
a bit more insecure

1269
01:01:06,741 --> 01:01:08,409

The money they were making,
night after night,

1332
01:04:04,552 --> 01:04:09,590
compared to other acts,
was unprecedented.

1333
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:12,260
The fact is,
they had to play stadiums.

1334
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:15,196
Promoters and local police
had to be begging Brian Epstein,

1335
01:04:15,196 --> 01:04:17,165
telling him, you know,
you can't go

1336
01:04:17,165 --> 01:04:19,167
and play a 5,000‐seat theater

1337
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:22,937
and have 50,000 teenagers
going crazy outside.

1338
01:04:22,937 --> 01:04:29,277
It would be impossible
to control.

1339
01:04:29,277 --> 01:04:30,645
This was massive.

1340
01:04:30,645 --> 01:04:33,748
The first big stadium tour
in history.

1341
01:04:33,748 --> 01:04:37,551
And the biggest show
of them all was New York.

1342
01:04:41,355 --> 01:04:43,825
There was the announcement
of this concert,

1343
01:04:43,825 --> 01:04:45,326
and I was like, can we?

1344
01:04:45,326 --> 01:04:49,330
And my mom was like, We don't
have the money for this.

1345
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:51,800
And then something,

1346
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,502
I don't know how she did it,

1347
01:04:54,502 --> 01:04:57,672
I don't know,
I don't know how she did it,

1348
01:04:57,672 --> 01:05:00,374
but she got two tickets.

1349
01:05:01,609 --> 01:05:03,912
And she didn't tell me.

1350
01:05:03,912 --> 01:05:06,380
So this is what happened.

1351
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,316
She said, "We need to go."
I said, "Where are we going?"

1352
01:05:08,316 --> 01:05:11,419
She said, "I'll let you know
when we get there." Okay.

1353
01:05:11,419 --> 01:05:14,588
So we're on the train, and I'm
not paying any attention.

1354
01:05:14,588 --> 01:05:16,390
And we get up, and I say,
where are we?

1355
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:19,493
And she said,
we're at Shea Stadium.

1356
01:05:19,493 --> 01:05:21,930
And I said, why?

1357
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:23,331
And she held up two tickets,

1358
01:05:23,331 --> 01:05:25,967
and all I remember
is my head going poof.

1359
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:27,268

01:05:27,268 --> 01:05:30,004

1364
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:45,086
It's fantastic. It just
knocked you out, you know.

1365
01:05:45,086 --> 01:05:47,555
Shea Stadium
is an enormous place.

1366
01:05:47,555 --> 01:05:50,024
I mean, that was
the first time it was used

1367
01:05:50,024 --> 01:05:51,592
for a rock concert.

1368
01:05:51,592 --> 01:05:56,564
Vox made us special,
big amplifiers for that tour,

1369
01:05:56,564 --> 01:05:58,733
and they were, like,
a hundred watts.

1370
01:05:58,733 --> 01:06:00,301
(laughs)

1371
01:06:00,301 --> 01:06:02,737
It just obviously,
you know, wasn't enough.

1372
01:06:05,473 --> 01:06:10,645
Ladies and gentlemen,
here are the Beatles!

Hello, John.

1377
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,651
We'd like to do a song

1378
01:06:49,651 --> 01:06:54,055
off our LP album,
Beatles VI, I think.

1379
01:06:54,055 --> 01:06:55,690
Can you hear me?

1380
01:06:57,191 --> 01:06:58,459
Hello?

1381
01:07:00,494 --> 01:07:03,097
It's called
"Dizzy Miss Lizzy"!

1382
01:07:03,097 --> 01:07:08,302
(playing "Dizzy Miss Lizzy")

1383
01:07:22,283 --> 01:07:25,253
♪ You make me dizzy,
Miss Lizzy

1384
01:07:25,253 --> 01:07:28,522
♪ The way you
rock and roll

1385
01:07:28,522 --> 01:07:32,093
♪ You make me dizzy,
Miss Lizzy

1386
01:07:32,093 --> 01:07:35,496
♪ When we do the stroll

1387
01:07:35,496 --> 01:07:38,499
♪ Come on, come on,
come on, come on Lizzy

1388
01:07:38,499 --> 01:07:42,436
♪ Love me
before I grow too old

1389
01:07:42,436 --> 01:07:45,339
♪ Gonna tell you, mama

1390
01:07:45,339 --> 01:07:47,441
♪ I want you to be my bride ♪

1391
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:48,810
One of the most
remarkable things about

1392
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:51,612
the Beatles playing live
is how in tune they are.

1393
01:07:51,612 --> 01:07:54,248
Because, they can't possibly
hear themselves.

1394
01:07:54,248 --> 01:07:55,950
I don't think
they had monitors.

1395
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:57,351
They don't sound very big,

1396
01:07:57,351 --> 01:07:59,020
even if they were
cranked to the max,

1397
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,989
they're not that loud.

1398
01:08:00,989 --> 01:08:02,891
I mean, Shea Stadium
being the most extreme,

1399
01:08:02,891 --> 01:08:05,393
because I don't even think
there's a P. A. at Shea Stadium.

1400
01:08:05,393 --> 01:08:07,128
They're going
through the Tannoy,

1401
01:08:07,128 --> 01:08:08,462
which must have sounded like

1402
01:08:08,462 --> 01:08:11,365
a thousand transistor radios
detuned.

1403
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:16,337
(tinny sound)

1404
01:08:16,337 --> 01:08:19,641
♪ Just a‐rockin' and a‐rollin'

1405
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:24,779
♪ Girl I wish you were mine ♪

1406
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:27,248
We did the house P. A.,
you know,

1407
01:08:27,248 --> 01:08:29,851
"And on first base
is Willy Wonka,"

1408
01:08:29,851 --> 01:08:32,854
whatever they said,
that's the equipment we had.

1409
01:08:32,854 --> 01:08:34,055
(laughs)

1410
01:08:34,055 --> 01:08:36,257
♪ When you rock and roll ♪

1411
01:08:36,257 --> 01:08:37,892
RINGO:
I could not hear anything.

1412
01:08:37,892 --> 01:08:40,762
I'd be watching John's ass,
Paul's ass,

1413
01:08:40,762 --> 01:08:43,597
his foot's tapping,
his head's nodding,

1414
01:08:43,597 --> 01:08:47,135
to see where we were
in the song.

1415
01:08:47,135 --> 01:08:52,340
♪ I wanna be your lovin' man ♪

1416
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:57,578
(crowd screaming)

1417
01:08:57,578 --> 01:09:00,281
PAUL: We played for
56,000 people at Shea Stadium.

1418
01:09:00,281 --> 01:09:03,284
After that, you know, you just
sort of think to yourself,

1419
01:09:03,284 --> 01:09:06,655
what more could you do?

1420
01:09:06,655 --> 01:09:10,091
I remember George bringin'
up the subject with Brian.

1421
01:09:10,091 --> 01:09:13,928
Hey, is this touring
gonna be an annual event?

1422
01:09:13,928 --> 01:09:15,864
And I think
he was the first one

1423
01:09:15,864 --> 01:09:21,535
that brought up the idea of,
Hey, I've had enough of this.

1424
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:23,537
That was the good thing
about being four together.

1425
01:09:23,537 --> 01:09:25,173
We're not like Elvis, you know.

1426
01:09:25,173 --> 01:09:27,608
I always felt sorry for Elvis
'cause he was on his own.

1427
01:09:27,608 --> 01:09:30,544
He had his guys with him,
but there's only one Elvis.

1428
01:09:30,544 --> 01:09:33,014
Nobody else
knew what he felt like.

1429
01:09:33,014 --> 01:09:36,685
But for us,
we all shared the experience.

1430
01:09:40,822 --> 01:09:43,291
They came back to England
late summer of '65.

1431
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:46,761
(crowd screaming)

1432
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:48,697
The last time the Beatles
played in Britain

1433
01:09:48,697 --> 01:09:51,933
was that winter, you know,
seven or eight days.

1434
01:09:51,933 --> 01:09:54,435
My grandparents bought me
tickets to see them,

1435
01:09:54,435 --> 01:09:57,639
and my parents
refused to let me go.

1436
01:09:57,639 --> 01:10:01,142
♪ Got a good reason

1437
01:10:01,142 --> 01:10:03,712
♪ For takin' the easy way out ♪

1438
01:10:03,712 --> 01:10:05,579
The Beatles
captured my imagination

1439
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:07,616
like no other group
at that point.

1440
01:10:07,616 --> 01:10:10,785
It was the way that I began
to interpret the world.

1441
01:10:10,785 --> 01:10:13,655
Each new record was built
on the record before,

1442
01:10:13,655 --> 01:10:15,624
you had this wonderful
storyline advancing

1443
01:10:15,624 --> 01:10:17,826
through with the Beatles.

1444
01:10:17,826 --> 01:10:19,160
By the end of the year,
we'd been told

1445
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,029
there would be
more records forthcoming.

1446
01:10:21,029 --> 01:10:25,466
(crowd screaming)

1447
01:10:25,466 --> 01:10:27,601
And they went
back into studio.

1448
01:10:30,504 --> 01:10:32,206
(Paul speaking indistinctly)

1449
01:10:32,206 --> 01:10:33,642
GEORGE: The light's on.

1450
01:10:33,642 --> 01:10:36,110
You might as have a go
and sing one song.

1451
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:38,647
JOHN: See if we're all
in tune when we play, George.

1452
01:10:38,647 --> 01:10:41,850
GEORGE MARTIN:
"Girl," take one.

1453
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:47,121
♪ Is there anybody
going to listen to my story

1454
01:10:47,121 --> 01:10:50,524
♪ All about the girl
who came to stay ♪

1455
01:10:50,524 --> 01:10:53,662
The first reaction
to the new, innovative sound

1456
01:10:53,662 --> 01:10:55,764
of Rubber Soul was,
I don't like this.

1457
01:10:55,764 --> 01:10:58,032
I think they've
lost their minds.

1458
01:10:58,032 --> 01:10:59,868
♪ Girl, girl ♪

1459
01:10:59,868 --> 01:11:02,236
What are they thinking?
You know, what's this?

1460
01:11:02,236 --> 01:11:05,239
♪ She's the kind of
girl who'll put you down

1463
01:11:08,943 --> 01:11:10,478
I kind of went
from being a kid

1464
01:11:10,478 --> 01:11:12,246
to being a teenager,
so some of those things

1465
01:11:12,246 --> 01:11:15,516
felt like the right thing,
but it was still surprising,

1466
01:11:15,516 --> 01:11:17,886
this group I liked
changed so much.

1467
01:11:17,886 --> 01:11:21,589
♪ Girl ♪

1468
01:11:21,589 --> 01:11:23,591
There's a big jump
from "I Want to Hold Your Hand"

1469
01:11:23,591 --> 01:11:25,059
to, Well, she told
when she was young

1470
01:11:25,059 --> 01:11:26,895
when pain
would lead to pleasure.

1471

♪ Did she understand it

1474
01:11:36,638 --> 01:11:38,272
I couldn't understand it
at all when I first heard it.

1475
01:11:38,272 --> 01:11:39,573
I didn't think it was any good.

1476
01:11:39,573 --> 01:11:41,142
And then, six weeks later,

1477
01:11:41,142 --> 01:11:43,111
you couldn't live without
the record, and that's good.

1478
01:11:43,111 --> 01:11:44,713
That's when you trust the
people that make music

1479
01:11:44,713 --> 01:11:47,515
to take you somewhere
you haven't been before.

1480
01:11:47,515 --> 01:11:50,018
(rock music)

1481
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:51,786
VINTAGE REPORTER: Formal
occasion at Buckingham Palace

1482
01:11:51,786 --> 01:11:53,655
on a foggy October morning.

1483
01:11:53,655 --> 01:11:56,490
The ceremony is bestowing
awards of honor,

1484
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:58,660
a ceremony hallowed
by a tradition

1485
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:02,096
going back over the centuries.

1486
01:12:02,096 --> 01:12:07,368
Members of the Most Excellent
Order of the British Empire.

1487
01:12:07,368 --> 01:12:08,569
MAN: Do you think the Beatles

1488
01:12:08,569 --> 01:12:10,138
should have been
awarded the MBE?

1489
01:12:10,138 --> 01:12:11,372
MAN #2: Well, I think
the Beatles have probably

1490
01:12:11,372 --> 01:12:12,874
done as much for popular music

1491
01:12:12,874 --> 01:12:15,076
than people like Rodgers
&amp; Hammerstein and Gershwin did.

1492
01:12:15,076 --> 01:12:16,945
The only difference being,
the Beatles have done it

1493
01:12:16,945 --> 01:12:18,512
in a matter
of two or three years,

1494
01:12:18,512 --> 01:12:21,315
where it took most
other people a lifetime.

1495
01:12:21,315 --> 01:12:25,954
REPORTER: What's the MBE going
to do your teenage rebel image?

1496
01:12:25,954 --> 01:12:29,123
Who's got
a teenage rebel image?

1497
01:12:29,123 --> 01:12:31,325
Have any of you
any ambitions left at all?

1498
01:12:31,325 --> 01:12:33,061
I'd like to be a duke.

1499
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:37,098
(laughter)

1500
01:12:37,098 --> 01:12:38,833
JON SAVAGE: They had
achieved something,

1501
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:40,434
and there were,
if you like, influencers,

1502
01:12:40,434 --> 01:12:43,104
but at the same time they
were prisoners of their fame.

1503
01:12:43,104 --> 01:12:44,806
And I think they were
beginning to chafe

1504
01:12:44,806 --> 01:12:47,075
at people's expectations.

1505
01:12:57,218 --> 01:12:59,854
The first three months
had been lopped off

1506
01:12:59,854 --> 01:13:01,923
to do whatever the Beatles'
third film was going to be.

1507
01:13:01,923 --> 01:13:03,725
And then it didn't happen.

1508
01:13:03,725 --> 01:13:05,559
And so for the first time
since they'd

1509
01:13:05,559 --> 01:13:10,231
become successful and famous,
they had three months off.

1510
01:13:10,231 --> 01:13:12,533
(soft guitar music)

1511
01:13:16,137 --> 01:13:18,840
GEORGE: It had been
four years for us

1512
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,810
of legging around
in this mania,

1513
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:24,879
and we were tired,
we needed to rest.

1514
01:13:24,879 --> 01:13:26,815
♪ I once had a girl

1515
01:13:26,815 --> 01:13:28,983
♪ Or should I say

1516
01:13:28,983 --> 01:13:32,353
♪ She once had me ♪

1517
01:13:32,353 --> 01:13:34,222
You know, the thing is
that we're all interested

1518
01:13:34,222 --> 01:13:36,691
in other things
before the Beatles,

1519
01:13:36,691 --> 01:13:37,926
and we didn't really have time,

1520
01:13:37,926 --> 01:13:40,795
but we were always
looking around.

1521
01:13:40,795 --> 01:13:43,064
I got involved
with a gallery owner.

1522
01:13:43,064 --> 01:13:46,134
We'd go to Paris
and we'd buy paintings.

1523
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:49,003
We'd go to the dealer.
So it was very exciting.

1524
01:13:50,538 --> 01:13:54,442
Of course, George had developed
an interest in Indian music.

1525
01:13:54,442 --> 01:13:57,311
(sitar music)

1526
01:14:01,182 --> 01:14:04,085
GEORGE: I just wanna carry
on progressing with music,

1527
01:14:04,085 --> 01:14:08,356
you know, writing more
and just learning more about it.

1528
01:14:08,356 --> 01:14:11,125
I've written so many songs
that I've just thrown away

1529
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:13,561
as I've been writing
them, because I've wanted,

1530
01:14:13,561 --> 01:14:16,230
when I finally
recorded one of mine,

1531
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:19,400
I wanted it to be
worth putting on the LP

1532
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,369
alongside Paul and John.

1533
01:14:21,369 --> 01:14:25,439
I feel now I've got more idea
about how to write songs.

1534
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:28,576
(violin music)

1535
01:14:28,576 --> 01:14:30,078
We bought this house
in the country

1536
01:14:30,078 --> 01:14:33,514
on this estate,
Maureen and Zach, my son,

1537
01:14:33,514 --> 01:14:35,650
and John was up the road.

1538
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:38,720
We started to grow up,
and we started

1539
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,189
to have families,
and we started

1540
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:45,459
to put less energy
into the Beatle bag.

1541
01:14:45,459 --> 01:14:47,161
We all, kind of,
were very aware

1542
01:14:47,161 --> 01:14:50,064
that we didn't live in
each other's pockets anymore.

1543
01:14:50,064 --> 01:14:53,301
We all had separate existences.

1544
01:14:53,301 --> 01:14:55,103
There's an interview
that John Lennon gives

1545
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:58,272
to Morning Cleave,
which is publish in March '66

1546
01:14:58,272 --> 01:15:00,174
where he talks
about his reading.

1547
01:15:00,174 --> 01:15:02,310
He says I'm not really sure
what I'm going to do next,

1548
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:03,912
this isn't everything,
which is not

1549
01:15:03,912 --> 01:15:06,380
what a pop star
was supposed to say.

1550
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:07,982
(camera clicking)

1551
01:15:07,982 --> 01:15:11,419
That same month, March,
they were doing a photo shoot.

1552
01:15:11,419 --> 01:15:14,022
JOHN: By then, we were really
sort of beginning to hate it.

1553
01:15:14,022 --> 01:15:15,757
A photo session
was a big ordeal,

1554
01:15:15,757 --> 01:15:17,826
and you had to try
and look normal,

1555
01:15:17,826 --> 01:15:19,894
and you didn't feel it.

1556
01:15:19,894 --> 01:15:21,295
PAUL: Bob Whitaker
was one of the photographers

1557
01:15:21,295 --> 01:15:23,898
who took our pictures,
and he came up with,

1558
01:15:23,898 --> 01:15:26,067
we all put on white lab coats

1559
01:15:26,067 --> 01:15:29,070
and we pretend
to be mad professors.

1560
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:31,873
JOHN: The photographer's
a bit of a surrealist, you know?

1561
01:15:31,873 --> 01:15:35,677
(upbeat music)

1562
01:15:35,677 --> 01:15:37,078
We really got into it,

1563
01:15:37,078 --> 01:15:39,848
and that's when we felt,
like, yeah.

♪ To say about the things

1565
01:15:44,252 --> 01:15:45,987
PAUL: To us, you know,
this wasn't a big deal, really,

1566
01:15:45,987 --> 01:15:48,757
because these kind of
shocking things

1567
01:15:48,757 --> 01:15:51,025
were part of the art scene.

JOHN: I especially wished

1571
01:15:58,199 --> 01:16:00,534
for it to be an album cover,
you know.

1572
01:16:00,534 --> 01:16:02,570
It got out in America,

1573
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:04,973
and there was some kind of fuss.

1574
01:16:04,973 --> 01:16:06,307
They were like, what?

1575
01:16:06,307 --> 01:16:07,676
My beloved Beatles?

1576
01:16:07,676 --> 01:16:08,877
No!

1577
01:16:08,877 --> 01:16:11,545

GEORGE: Yeah, just
leave it out again then.

1581

PAUL: Okay.

1582
01:16:18,552 --> 01:16:21,856
GEORGE: I'll just
have to vamp it up a bit.

1583
01:16:21,856 --> 01:16:23,892
JOHN: Now he tells me.

1584
01:16:23,892 --> 01:16:26,160
RINGO: We're having
more fun in the studio.

1585
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,062
It was getting
more experimental.

1586
01:16:28,062 --> 01:16:30,899

RINGO: They weren't,
like, big plans.

01:16:41,142 --> 01:16:44,713
You know,
sometimes they just unfolded.

1593
01:16:44,713 --> 01:16:46,247
Complete fluke.

1594
01:16:48,617 --> 01:16:51,820
JOHN: Okay, ready.

1595
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,988
John was
not mechanically minded,

1596
01:16:53,988 --> 01:16:57,826
and he took a tape home,
and the tape would run off

1597
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:00,261
to the other reel,
and he put it on

1598
01:17:00,261 --> 01:17:03,665
like it was the start,
but it was the end of the song,

1599
01:17:03,665 --> 01:17:05,066
and that's when the guitar came.

1600
01:17:05,066 --> 01:17:07,636
(imitating warbling)

1601
01:17:07,636 --> 01:17:10,805
And he brings it in,
man, you gotta hear this.

1602
01:17:10,805 --> 01:17:13,842

being in Brian Epstein's house

1607
01:17:31,492 --> 01:17:35,263
and John playing it to Brian,
and to George Martin,

1608
01:17:35,263 --> 01:17:37,331
and saying,
What do you think of this?

1609
01:17:37,331 --> 01:17:41,235
You can see there's a puzzlement
going across their faces.

1610
01:17:41,235 --> 01:17:44,505
But instead of saying,
oh, come on guys,

1611
01:17:44,505 --> 01:17:46,675
I think you really oughta
put another chord in,

1612
01:17:46,675 --> 01:17:49,878

1614

even putting backwards tape in,

1616
01:17:57,551 --> 01:17:59,087
put in electronic sounds,
and this is the kind of

1617
01:17:59,087 --> 01:18:00,588
thing you can do in a recording,

1618
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:02,657
which you obviously
couldn't possibly do live

1619
01:18:02,657 --> 01:18:05,326
because it is, in fact,
making up music as you go along.

1620
01:18:12,634 --> 01:18:14,903
"Tomorrow Never Knows"
breaks so many barriers,

1621
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:16,404
musically speaking,

1622
01:18:16,404 --> 01:18:18,873
and does so many things
that no one had done before.

1623
01:18:18,873 --> 01:18:20,208
It's got a drone
all the way through,

1624
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:21,810
which is something that
happens in Indian music

1625
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:24,946
and used to exist in Western
music in the 12th century.

1626
01:18:24,946 --> 01:18:27,548
So it sort of triggered
a whole movement

1627
01:18:27,548 --> 01:18:29,884
that popular music would
start to bring in these

1628
01:18:29,884 --> 01:18:30,985
other records
from the avant garde,

1629
01:18:30,985 --> 01:18:32,721
put them into mainstream songs,

1630
01:18:32,721 --> 01:18:35,489

of people would hear.

01:18:47,135 --> 01:18:48,536
we were the nice,
clean mop‐tops

1635
01:18:48,536 --> 01:18:51,305
and every mother's son
and everyone loved us.

1636
01:18:51,305 --> 01:18:53,708
And suddenly
there were a few things

1637
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:55,710
that they don't understand.

1638
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:57,211
It's just, we're men now.

1639
01:18:57,211 --> 01:19:00,782
We're a bit older than
those lads that started out.

we got on a train
and went up to Hamburg.

1648

GEORGE: By then, I don't
think we wanted to be anywhere.

1649

you know.

That's only in your mind.

GEORGE: Because we're
not flattering you.

1658

sort of nice answers

1659

to all the questions,

1660
01:19:53,668 --> 01:19:55,403
but the questions
aren't nice questions.

1661
01:19:55,403 --> 01:19:57,205
We don't have to have
nice answers.

1662
01:19:57,205 --> 01:19:59,007
And if we don't give
nice answers,

it just means we're natural.

Everything was
hit‐and‐run in those days,

1666
01:20:07,849 --> 01:20:10,318
and I think the next day
after the Hamburg concert

1667
01:20:10,318 --> 01:20:12,921
we had a flight to Tokyo.

1676
01:20:32,874 --> 01:20:34,442
In Japan, people
were demonstrating

1677
01:20:34,442 --> 01:20:36,044

was supposed to be

was out of hand.

1715
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:40,468
when you get to the stage?

1716
01:22:40,468 --> 01:22:41,803
Well, it worries me, yes,

1717
01:22:41,803 --> 01:22:43,905
but I hope everything
will be all right

1718
01:22:43,905 --> 01:22:45,473
in the end, as they say.

1719
01:22:45,473 --> 01:22:47,208
Do you think this is going
to be a controversial tour

1720
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:48,309
like the Philippines was?

1721
01:22:48,309 --> 01:22:49,543
Oh no, no, no.

1722
01:22:49,543 --> 01:22:51,913
No, it's going to be fine.

1723
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:53,081
What makes you say that?

1724
01:22:53,081 --> 01:22:54,949
Oh, it'll be fine.
You watch.

1725
01:22:54,949 --> 01:22:56,150
It'll be great.

1728
01:23:06,527 --> 01:23:08,329
It was all
because of that interview

1729
01:23:08,329 --> 01:23:10,732
John had given
while on vacation.

1730
01:23:10,732 --> 01:23:13,635
It was reprinted
in America months later.

1731
01:23:13,635 --> 01:23:17,071
"Lennon says the Beatles
are bigger than Christ."

1732
01:23:17,071 --> 01:23:18,740
(bells tolling)

1733
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:23,344
At that time, churches were
losing their congregations.

1734
01:23:23,344 --> 01:23:26,547
People were going to church
less and less and less.

1735
01:23:30,251 --> 01:23:32,320
John was saying,
we're so famous,

1736
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,388
we're so, oh you won't
believe the fame.

1737
01:23:34,388 --> 01:23:37,826
I mean, like,
we're bigger than Jesus.

1738
01:23:37,826 --> 01:23:40,662
It was a harmless remark
in the middle of an article,

1739
01:23:40,662 --> 01:23:43,665
and it never made
the front page in England.

1740

That unleashed a firestorm

1741
01:23:45,533 --> 01:23:47,535
in the United States.

1742
01:23:47,535 --> 01:23:50,872
It was almost like the plot
of Help! had become real,

1743
01:23:50,872 --> 01:23:52,774
and they actually
had a lot of people

1744
01:23:52,774 --> 01:23:54,876
who suddenly wanted
to dismember them.

They were just stunned.

01:24:18,599 --> 01:24:20,001
You have to really put
it into perspective.

1756
01:24:20,001 --> 01:24:22,303
I mean, the whole
scandal was very serious,

1757
01:24:22,303 --> 01:24:24,172
partly because of the violence

1758
01:24:24,172 --> 01:24:26,107
that was in America at the time.

1759
01:24:26,107 --> 01:24:29,644
(shots whistling)

1760
01:24:29,644 --> 01:24:32,213
We'd just had the Texas sniper,
Charles Whitman,

1761
01:24:32,213 --> 01:24:35,516
who'd just shot dead 20 people.

1762
01:24:35,516 --> 01:24:38,386
This was the same country
only three years before

1763
01:24:38,386 --> 01:24:42,056
where the President
had been assassinated.

1764
01:24:42,056 --> 01:24:47,261
It had got dangerous,
and we were threatened.

1765
01:24:47,261 --> 01:24:50,431
We knew we weren't
being blasphemous.

1766
01:24:50,431 --> 01:24:53,001
We weren't anti‐Jesus.

1767
01:24:53,001 --> 01:24:56,570
In fact, we all had pretty
religious upbringings, really.

1768
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:59,708
But you do see John
as sort of a broken man,

1769
01:24:59,708 --> 01:25:02,310
because you realize
he had to apologize.

1770
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:04,979
I was the only thing
that would stop this.

1771
01:25:04,979 --> 01:25:08,650
I pointed out that fact
in reference to England,

1772
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:12,053
that we meant more
to kids than Jesus did,

1773
01:25:12,053 --> 01:25:13,955
or religion at that time.

1774
01:25:13,955 --> 01:25:15,657
I wasn't knocking it
or putting it down,

1775
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:18,259
I was just saying it
as a fact.

1776
01:25:18,259 --> 01:25:22,831
And it sort of is true, better
more for England than here.

1777
01:25:22,831 --> 01:25:25,834
I'm not saying that
we're better or greater

1778
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:28,903
or comparing us with
Jesus Christ as a person,

1779
01:25:28,903 --> 01:25:31,372
or God as a thing,
whatever it is,

1780
01:25:31,372 --> 01:25:32,774
you know, I just said
what I said,

1781
01:25:32,774 --> 01:25:35,076
and it was wrong,
or was taken wrong,

1782
01:25:35,076 --> 01:25:36,678
but now it's all this.

1783
01:25:36,678 --> 01:25:40,649
He's longing to break
out of it and do a joke,

1784
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:42,150
but he knows he can't.

1785
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:45,386
If it had said television is
more popular than Jesus,

1786
01:25:45,386 --> 01:25:47,255
I might have got away with it.

1787
01:25:47,255 --> 01:25:48,623
(laughter)

1788
01:25:48,623 --> 01:25:50,558
I just happened to be
talking to a friend,

1789
01:25:50,558 --> 01:25:53,795
they used the word
Beatles as a remote thing,

1790
01:25:53,795 --> 01:25:55,630
not as what I think,
because Beatles

1791
01:25:55,630 --> 01:25:58,767
as those other Beatles,
like other people see us,

1792
01:25:58,767 --> 01:26:02,003
I just said they are
having more influence

1793
01:26:02,003 --> 01:26:03,371
on kids and things

1794
01:26:03,371 --> 01:26:05,974
than anything else,
including Jesus.

1795
01:26:05,974 --> 01:26:07,642
I said it in that way,

1796
01:26:07,642 --> 01:26:10,044
which is the wrong way,
yep, yep.

1797
01:26:10,044 --> 01:26:13,414
PAUL: He was scared.
We were all pretty scared.

1798
01:26:13,414 --> 01:26:16,584
Most of the people
in the room understood it.

1799
01:26:16,584 --> 01:26:19,153
It's like one of those lines.

1800
01:26:19,153 --> 01:26:21,155

on the tour, period,
in '66, that was it.

1809
01:26:47,415 --> 01:26:49,117
I was friends

They said, Do you wanna do it?

I didn't even know how to
set up a drum kit at the time.

I had no idea.

1813
01:26:54,656 --> 01:26:57,659
I was a musician in Boston,
a folk singer.

1814

I had no qualifications at all.

the sound was so bad

1819
01:27:10,204 --> 01:27:12,073
that everybody rushed the stage.

1820
01:27:12,073 --> 01:27:14,743
REPORTER: Cleveland Stadium
has been absolutely riots.

1821
01:27:14,743 --> 01:27:16,610
The whole place went wild here,

1822
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:19,748
broke the barriers,
came through the police cordon.

1823
01:27:19,748 --> 01:27:21,716
We managed to get
the Beatles off the stage,

1824
01:27:21,716 --> 01:27:24,052
they were even
all over the stage.

I was gonna get hurt.

We get to Memphis and
there's been a bomb scare,

1827
01:27:30,524 --> 01:27:32,961
and we had to delay the show,
I think the

1828
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:36,798
bomb‐sniffing dogs
throughout the whole theater.

1829
01:27:36,798 --> 01:27:38,466
That kind of stuff
was happening all the time.

1830
01:27:38,466 --> 01:27:40,034
It was terrifying.

1831
01:27:40,034 --> 01:27:42,871
Some people would set off
firecrackers in the hall

1832
01:27:42,871 --> 01:27:45,974
and you'd think one
of the others had got shot.

1833
01:27:48,142 --> 01:27:52,513
And we flew off to St. Louis,
and it was pouring rain.

1834
01:27:58,419 --> 01:28:02,791
My job was to sit backstage
with my hand on the plug,

1835
01:28:02,791 --> 01:28:05,660
and the instructions were,
if one of them fell down,

1836
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:07,328
like knocked out by the shock,

1837
01:28:07,328 --> 01:28:11,599
then you should pull the plug,
and that would stop the show.

1838
01:28:11,599 --> 01:28:13,101
It was a joke.

1839
01:28:14,736 --> 01:28:18,773
(crowd screaming)

1840
01:28:18,773 --> 01:28:20,041
This was three weeks
that they just

1841
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:21,976
took a deep breath
and said, okay,

1842
01:28:21,976 --> 01:28:24,178
let's just do this and
we'll make a lot of money.

1843
01:28:27,181 --> 01:28:28,917
(somber music)

1844
01:28:28,917 --> 01:28:31,886
RINGO: A lot of the time we
were going through the motions,

1845
01:28:31,886 --> 01:28:35,589
and we all started
to get pretty fed up.

1846
01:28:35,589 --> 01:28:38,960
George particularly was
quite vocal about that.

1847
01:28:40,929 --> 01:28:43,131
GEORGE: I was saying,
"I don't wanna do this anymore.

1848
01:28:43,131 --> 01:28:44,799
I don't like this."

1849
01:28:44,799 --> 01:28:47,268
I certainly
felt that that was it.

1850
01:28:47,268 --> 01:28:51,172
You know, that we weren't
going to tour again like that.

1851
01:29:16,631 --> 01:29:18,266
There was no enjoyment in it.

1852
01:29:18,266 --> 01:29:21,435
The music wasn't being heard.
It wasn't dong anything.

1853
01:29:21,435 --> 01:29:23,504
It was just a sort of
freak show.

1854
01:29:26,274 --> 01:29:28,209
The Beatles were the show,
and the music

1855
01:29:28,209 --> 01:29:29,911
had nothing to do with it.

1856
01:29:32,914 --> 01:29:36,851
As we were musicians, we felt,
if we're gonna be Beatles,

1857
01:29:36,851 --> 01:29:39,287
the only reason to be a Beatle
is to make music,

1858
01:29:39,287 --> 01:29:40,989
and not be in a circus.

1859
01:29:47,561 --> 01:29:49,698
And when we were finished,
I remember

1860
01:29:49,698 --> 01:29:53,601
just being piled in
the back of this meat wagon,

1861
01:29:53,601 --> 01:29:57,038
which was steel,
and nothing else inside.

1862
01:29:58,172 --> 01:30:00,341
We're all in this,
sort of sliding around

1863
01:30:00,341 --> 01:30:03,044
as it went around the corners,

1864
01:30:03,044 --> 01:30:06,180
and we're all really mad
at the whole bloody thing.

1865
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:09,450
John started, and George,
like, oh that's it.

1866
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:11,653
I've had enough, you know.

1867
01:30:11,653 --> 01:30:15,323
And we all agreed.

1868
01:30:15,323 --> 01:30:16,658
We were just sitting in the van,

1869
01:30:16,658 --> 01:30:19,193
saying,
That's enough of that.

1870
01:30:28,369 --> 01:30:34,776
(piano music)

1871
01:30:34,776 --> 01:30:37,511
We all knew, to survive,
we had to

1872
01:30:37,511 --> 01:30:40,782
get back in the studio
and get to know each other

1873
01:30:40,782 --> 01:30:43,384
and play again.

1874
01:30:43,384 --> 01:30:45,654
I'm not holding back, George.

1875
01:30:45,654 --> 01:30:47,922
I'm giving my all.

1876
01:30:47,922 --> 01:30:49,357
GEORGE: It used to make
us laugh when we'd read

1877
01:30:49,357 --> 01:30:51,826
people saying,
the problem with the Beatles

1878
01:30:51,826 --> 01:30:53,762
is that while
we were all growing up,

1879
01:30:53,762 --> 01:30:55,697
they were all on tour,
and so they missed

1880
01:30:55,697 --> 01:30:57,398
the growing‐up period.

1881
01:30:57,398 --> 01:31:01,335
But the truth to it was, we
were snatched out of our youth.

1891
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:25,026

expressed ourselves

because we were so fed up
with being what we were,

1901
01:31:52,754 --> 01:31:55,356
we had to get out of it,
one way or another.

01:42:37,198 --> 01:42:39,067
we hoped that everybody
would like what would already

2058
01:42:39,067 --> 01:42:41,703
been our type of music
for several years already.

2059
01:42:41,703 --> 01:42:44,639
But we had no idea of all
the gear things in store for us.

2060
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:46,641
It all happened, really,
when "Please Please Me"

2061
01:42:46,641 --> 01:42:48,810
became a number one hit,
and after that, well,

2062
01:42:48,810 --> 01:42:50,544
cor' the blimeys,
heave the mo'.

2063
01:42:50,544 --> 01:42:52,146
Our biggest thrill of
the year‐‐ well, I suppose

2064
01:42:52,146 --> 01:42:54,015
it must have been top of the
bill at the London Palladium

2065
01:42:54,015 --> 01:42:55,750
and then only
a couple of days later

2066
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:57,585
being invited to take part
in the Royal Variety Show.

2067
01:42:57,585 --> 01:42:59,387
This time last year,
we're all dead chuffed

2068
01:42:59,387 --> 01:43:01,890
because "Love Me Do"
got in the top 20,

2069
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:03,591
and we can't believe, really,
that so many things

2070
01:43:03,591 --> 01:43:05,593
have happened
in between already.

2071
01:43:05,593 --> 01:43:07,295
Just before I pass you
over to Paul,

2072
01:43:07,295 --> 01:43:08,730
(Paul barking
like a small dog)

2073
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:10,431
I'd like to say thank you
to all the Beatle people

2074
01:43:10,431 --> 01:43:11,933
who have written to me
during the year,

2075
01:43:11,933 --> 01:43:14,703
and everyone who sent me
gifts and cards for my birthday,

2076
01:43:14,703 --> 01:43:16,871
which I'm trying to forget,
in October.

2077
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:18,339
I'd love to reply
personally to everyone,

2078
01:43:18,339 --> 01:43:19,941
but I just haven't enough pens.

2079
01:43:19,941 --> 01:43:21,109
In the meantime.

2080
01:43:21,109 --> 01:43:22,476
PAUL: This is Paul here.

2081
01:43:22,476 --> 01:43:23,945
Everything that John
said goes for me, too.

2082
01:43:23,945 --> 01:43:25,647
Especially the bit
about birthday cards

2083
01:43:25,647 --> 01:43:27,782
and the parcels, 'cause
all our homes and offices

2084
01:43:27,782 --> 01:43:29,350
got sacks of mail last June.

2085
01:43:29,350 --> 01:43:31,219
Ow! (laughs)

2086
01:43:31,219 --> 01:43:32,687
When it was my birthday.

2087
01:43:32,687 --> 01:43:34,789
Anyway, we're all dead pleased

2088
01:43:34,789 --> 01:43:37,091
by the way you've treated us
in 1963,

2089
01:43:37,091 --> 01:43:39,160
and we're trying to do
everything we can to please you

2090
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:41,763
with the type of songs
we write and record next year.

2091
01:43:41,763 --> 01:43:45,667
Oh, yeah, lots of people
asked us what we enjoyed best:

2092
01:43:45,667 --> 01:43:48,136
concerts and television
or recording.

2093
01:43:48,136 --> 01:43:49,938
We like doing stage shows,
'cause it's, you know,

2094
01:43:49,938 --> 01:43:51,673
it's great to hear
an audience enjoying themselves,

2095
01:43:51,673 --> 01:43:54,375
but the thing we like best‐‐
I think so, anyway‐‐

2096
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:56,711
is going
into the recording studio.

2097
01:43:56,711 --> 01:43:58,079
JOHN: Yes, we enjoy it
very kindly.

2098
01:43:58,079 --> 01:43:59,413
PAUL: To make new records.

2099
01:43:59,413 --> 01:44:00,749
Which is what we'd
been doing all day

2100
01:44:00,749 --> 01:44:02,183
before we started on this
special message.

2101
01:44:02,183 --> 01:44:04,052
Well, what we like to hear
most is one of our songs

2102
01:44:04,052 --> 01:44:06,655
taking shape
in the recording studio,

2103
01:44:06,655 --> 01:44:08,657
one of the ones what John
and I have written.

2104
01:44:08,657 --> 01:44:10,391
And then listening
to the tapes afterwards

2105
01:44:10,391 --> 01:44:12,326
to hear how it all
worked out, you see.

2106
01:44:12,326 --> 01:44:13,327
Ja, Ringo.

2107
01:44:13,327 --> 01:44:14,929
RINGO: Hello, Ringo here.

2108
01:44:14,929 --> 01:44:16,965
As you know, I was the last
member to join the Beatles.

2109
01:44:16,965 --> 01:44:19,267
I started to play drums
in the group 1962.

2110
01:44:19,267 --> 01:44:20,835
(laughs)

2111
01:44:20,835 --> 01:44:23,037
I've been in a couple
of other groups. Ow!

2112
01:44:23,037 --> 01:44:25,339
PAUL: Just wish the people
merry happy.

2113
01:44:25,339 --> 01:44:27,575
Go on, for Christmas.
Christmas.

2114
01:44:27,575 --> 01:44:29,210
RINGO:
Merry happy New Year,

2115
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:31,112
and folks, happy Christmas,

2116
01:44:31,112 --> 01:44:33,614
and may everything
you wish be granted.

2117
01:44:33,614 --> 01:44:35,583
PAUL: Sing us Wenceslas,
King Wenceslas.

2118
01:44:35,583 --> 01:44:36,951
RINGO: Wenceslas.

2119

2123
01:44:43,725 --> 01:44:46,527
I'm George Harrison. Nobody else

Not to mention,

It's your reaction

2134
01:45:05,747 --> 01:45:07,215
that really matters.

2135
01:45:07,215 --> 01:45:09,017
