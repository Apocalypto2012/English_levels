Season02 Episode05</font>

4
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,090
Previously on "dexter"...

5
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,260
What's this big break in the bay harbor
butcher case I keep hearing about?

6
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,600
Masuka found microscopic algae
Inside the garbage bags with the body.

7
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,780
It's all about the rocks,baby.

8
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,460
The rocks?

9
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,360
Yeah,the algae we found on the rocks.

10
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,630
The bay harbor butcher used
them to weigh his bags down.

11
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,190
We're assuming he picked them
up where he docks his boat.

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,050
October
3,1973 --

13
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,630
Laura moser and three others
found Chopped up with a chain saw.

14
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,500
Apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate
Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

15
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,800
What is in that report that
harry didn't want me to see?!

16
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,630
You were left there for days,

17
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,330
Starving,in blood two inches thick.

18
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,580
- Dexter,this is my mother.
- Gail.

19
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,370
He's hiding something. I'm sure of it.

20
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,240
Did you kill your wife?

21
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,770
- Yeah.
- Don't make me do it,curtis!

22
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,650
Debra,actually.

23
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,220
I'm gabriel.

24
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,770
Oh,you're into the kinky stuff,huh?

25
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,580
No,the last guy i had
sex with tried to kill me.

26
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,130
Oh,there's my sponsor.

27
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,660
Really? Where?

28
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,330
Dexter,meet dexter.

29
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,930
I'm gonna help the two of
you get to know each other.

30
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,750
You're going to tell me all
your deepest,darkest secrets.

31
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,380
But the person who did this...

32
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,540
Is a person just like me... Like you.

33
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,150
We're all good,dexter,and
we're all evil.

34
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,770
This woman sees me.

35
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,960
She doesn't know it,

36
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,500
But she's looking  behind the
mask, And she's not turning away.

37
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,700
'The Dark Defender'

38
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,080
Uh,here's your cappuccino
and scone,ma'am.

39
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,110
Can i help the next person,please?

40
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,200
Most people hate long lines.

41
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,340
Hi. Can i have a coffee and a danish?

42
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,840
The bank,grocery store,

43
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,460
Coffee bar.

44
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,910
Not me.

45
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,140
Buddy,you mind?

46
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,640
Want a real glimpse  of human nature?

47
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,450
Stand in the way  of
someone's mocha latte.

48
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,820
BAY HARBOR BUTCHER:FRIEND OR FOE?

49
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,060
It also reminds me that  the good people
of miami and i aren't so different.

50
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,650
They have no more idea
 of what i am than i do.

51
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,540
All i'm saying is these
guys had it coming.

52
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,320
So what,just chop them all up?

53
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,190
As far as i'm concerned, Whoever's
doing this shit deserves a goddamn medal.

54
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,710
That'll be $4.20,ma'am.

55
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,730
Sorry,my wallet's in here somewhere.

56
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,410
Oh,i got it.

57
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,630
Are you sure?

58
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,660
Yeah,i insist.

59
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,730
Thank you so much. You're a godsend.

60
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,430
Oh,sweet mary,mother
of fuck,that's good!

61
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,080
I think you might have broken a
commandment somewhere in there.

62
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,040
Burning the late-night
oil with the task force?

63
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,870
Hardly -- till we get the
report back on the algae,

64
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,180
It's just one big reach-around.

65
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,680
The rocks i used  to submerge my
victims May eventually sink me,too,

66
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,490
But if i'm learning anything  in
recovery, It's "one day at a time.

67
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,190
Bay harbor butcher.

68
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,550
Give me one shot -- I'd put
a bullet in the fucker's head.

69
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,980
You really feel that way?

70
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,350
He's killing people,dex.

71
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,140
If dad taught us one thing,it's
the value of human life.

72
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,520
Yeah,but i think we had
different homework assignments.

73
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,980
Dispatch.

74
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,750
See you tonight?

75
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,560
Mm,i think i'm staying at gabriel's.

76
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,030
- I thought you were taking it slow.
- We are.

77
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,350
No sex,just cuddling.

78
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,910
My little sister,the cuddler.

79
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,410
I got a scalding-hot beverage
here,dex. Don't make me use it.

80
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,990
Love you,too.

81
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,490
I never really got  the
whole superhero thing.

82
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,800
But lately,it does seem
we have a lot in common --

83
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,890
Tragic beginnings...
 Secret identities...

84
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,840
Part human,part mutant...

85
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,850
Archenemies.

86
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,380
Great way to start the day,huh?

87
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,510
Shouldn't you be moving
back into your office,boss?

88
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,530
I'd rather be here.

89
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,980
What can you tell me?

90
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,810
Blunt force trauma.

91
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,650
The blood spatter here on the counter Suggests
that this is where the initial blow occurred.

92
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,490
Impact spatter is consistent
With repeated blows to the skull.

93
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,350
The victim tried to flee to the
back door But didn't get far.

94
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,490
Who is he?

95
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,230
Denny foster
-- worked here.

96
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,150
Owner said he closed up nights.

97
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,390
Robbery?

98
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,530
There's no money missing
from the register.

99
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,090
Something this brutal is personal.

100
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,500
Want to meet your prime suspect?

101
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,890
He has fins.

102
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,230
Should we call the
super friends for help?

103
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,200
No,i got it covered.

104
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,740
I found traces of
blood here on the base.

105
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,830
I'll bring it back to my lab,
Confirm it's the murder weapon.

106
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,340
Okay.

107
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,590
Got a next of kin we can notify?

108
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,740
- Uh,denny was,like,a
loner -- - Who's that?

109
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,770
The dark defender.

110
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,970
Denny had this great idea to put a spin On that
vigilante serial killer we got running around.

111
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,170
Definitely has a nicer ring to
it Than the bay harbor butcher.

112
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,070
I'm conducting an interview here,morgan.

113
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,400
Denny was trying to set up the
dark defender As a graphic novel.

114
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,030
"stalker of the night, His blade of
vengeance turns wrong into right."

115
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,940
I need some air.

116
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,770
Thanks a lot.

117
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,040
"the dark defender."

118
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,070
No,miami's too hot for all that leather.

119
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,920
The first time i got high,i was 15.

120
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,680
No,that's not right. I was 14.

121
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,660
No,wait.

122
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:33,460
I was definitely 15 because
it was my freshman year.

123
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,870
I remember now because i
was dating susie mitchell.

124
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,450
We broke up 'cause i called her
By her sister,sharon's,name once.

125
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,220
She hated when people did that.

126
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,700
What she didn't know was
that i had a thing for sharon.

127
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,700
Sharon didn't want
anything to do with me,so...

128
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,750
Don't you hurt my baby!

129
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,700
don't you dare!

130
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,160
Don't look. Close your eyes.

131
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,200
Mommy loves you.

132
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,950
Don't you hurt my baby!

133
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,700
It's okay,mom.

134
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,180
You're safe.

135
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,800
That's hot.

136
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,240
Where did you drift off to,anyway?

137
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,540
I was having this bizarre
dream About my mother.

138
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,660
Say no more.

139
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,260
Oedipus complex
-- explains a lot.

140
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,720
So,what were you doing to
your mother in this dream?

141
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,830
Saving her life.

142
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,040
She was murdered...

143
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,680
When i was a boy.

144
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,390
I was there. I saw it happen.

145
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,580
I've never told anyone that before.

146
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,030
Come on.

147
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:57,020
Have you thought maybe you weren't
saving your mother In this dream?

148
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,450
Maybe you were saving yourself.

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,050
That's not what happened.

150
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,800
Don't be so sure.

151
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,840
When i got clean,

152
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,410
All the seriously fucked-up reasons i
used In the first place began to surface.

153
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,610
This could be where
your addiction started.

154
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,970
I hope whoever did it
got the bloody chair.

155
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,500
There were three men.

156
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,410
I don't know what happened to them.

157
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,210
Dexter,if these guys are behind bars,

158
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,000
You need to confront them.

159
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,170
If they're dead,hell,go
piss on their graves,

160
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,200
But you need to do whatever it takes

161
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,690
So you can get closure.

162
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,470
How else do you expect to get better?

163
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,610
I never expected to get better.

164
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,020
My meth lab's in the sock drawer.

165
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,380
- This looks bad,doesn't it?
- Yeah.

166
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,800
The cute panties help.

167
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,570
Would you believe i'm trying
to get to know you better?

168
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,530
By rifling through my stuff?

169
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,050
I'm retarded.

170
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,740
And you've been so great.

171
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,800
You know how i told you the last
guy i had sex with Tried to kill me?

172
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,890
Well,that was kind of true.

173
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,940
He was the ice-truck killer.

174
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,910
Who is he?

175
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,940
Not fucking funny.

176
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,320
- Come on,deb. I never heard of him before.
- Stop it. Don't screw with me.

177
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,820
Deb,i've been in el salvador
Visiting family for six months.

178
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,620
I just got back.

179
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,960
You sound like every other
jackass out there who thinks...

180
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,090
I'm a trophy fuck.

181
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,990
You had no idea who i was
when you hit on me at the gym?

182
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,260
When i hit on you at the gym,

183
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,360
It was because i thought you were hot.

184
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,520
Good answer.

185
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,270
So,what's hot about me?

186
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,500
- It's in the corner!
- Don't hurt it!

187
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,900
Oh,god,dexter,be careful.

188
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,240
Use a broom. It might have rabies.

189
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,650
Oh,it's right there! Get it!

190
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,990
Watch it!

191
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,120
Careful.

192
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,080
- All right!
- He got it!

193
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,340
My hero.

194
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,130
All right,kids. Show's over.

195
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,030
Come on. Let's get dressed for school.

196
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,420
So,any armadillos in michigan?

197
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,490
No.

198
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,010
We didn't used to have any in florida.

199
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,780
Now it's like an invasion.
"armadillos attack!"

200
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,770
You think you're charming,don't you?

201
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,620
I'm sure that probably works
for you most of the time.

202
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,860
It did for paul.

203
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,160
I know what you are.

204
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,930
Confused?

205
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,690
I found these in a drawer.

206
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,870
Tell me,dexter,

207
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,500
Why would rita print out narcotics
anonymous literature If paul's dead?

208
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,090
Because recently i entered the program.

209
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,440
I knew it.

210
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,680
I would never hurt rita like paul did.

211
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,750
Because i'm not gonna
give you that chance.

212
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,960
It's just a matter of time Before
you pull her under just like he did.

213
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,710
Have you discussed
any of this with rita?

214
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,630
No,but i will if you don't
do the right thing here.

215
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,870
If you truly care about this
family like you say you do,

216
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,640
You will let my daughter
and those sweet children go.

217
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,520
The algae on the rocks was
exposed to both zinc and lead.

218
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,840
There are only three marinas near bay
harbor Which have restricted water flow

219
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,480
That would account for such high
levels Of these specific pollutants --

220
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,660
Turkey creek,sunset keys,and coral cove.

221
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,950
Anyone familiar with these marinas?

222
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,040
Coral cove is where my
dad kept our family boat.

223
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,200
My brother uses the slip now.

224
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,390
I'll bet half the force
has boats out there.

225
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,100
It's one of the few marinas left
That's affordable on a cop's salary.

226
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,000
Morgan and i will take that one.

227
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,680
Sodoquist and lee,turkey creek is yours.
And,hill and ramos,you've got sunset keys.

228
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,110
The rest of you will stay
here with detective batista.

229
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,150
When the team reports in, Relay
the information back to me.

230
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,010
If our killer's boat is
out there,let's find it.

231
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,350
Sorry it took so long.

232
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,480
Couldn't seem to find any
other crime scene files.

233
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,280
Probably lost in storage somewhere.

234
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,080
Anyway,that's what i was able to dig up.

235
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,440
Just one file?

236
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,520
There were three men
arrested for those murders.

237
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,570
Well,one's deceased, One's
doing life without possibility,

238
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,630
And that's the only one that's
still an open case -- Santos jiminez.

239
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,300
Why's it an open case?

240
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,440
Jiminez turned state's evidence,
Went into witness protection.

241
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,940
There's a business
address in there for him.

242
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,430
I guess after 34 years, He figures all
the people who want him dead are long gone.

243
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,890
He figured wrong.

244
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,510
If you can't find what you need, There's
audio tapes cross-referenced with this file.

245
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,140
- Tapes?
- Yeah,see that notation?

246
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,730
There was a criminal informant
working a cocaine bust From the inside.

247
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,950
- I'll take this,too.
- Okay.

248
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,960
Harry always said,"never
make things personal --

249
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,510
Clouds your judgement."

250
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,230
But i've been living
in a fog  way too long.

251
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,440
today is friday,september 28,1973.

252
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,930
This is detective  harry morgan.

253
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,260
- Dad. -
Case file --

254
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,790
i can't fucking  do this anymore!

255
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,990
I have to know when the next
 shipment's coming in,laura.

256
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,090
Laura moser
-- my mother.

257
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,150
I can't take this anymore.

258
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,900
Harry,i'm so scared.

259
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,320
Everything's going to be okay.
You just need to calm down.

260
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,800
I already took the cocaine as
evidence,Just like you asked --

261
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,230
why isn't that enough?

262
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,430
If we want estrada and
his men behind bars,

263
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,830
We have to catch them in
the act at the shipyard.

264
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,200
He's gonna find out,and
then he's gonna kill me.

265
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,980
Harry,listen to me.

266
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,970
I think someone may have
followed us to the park.

267
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,170
If we were followed,i
would have noticed.

268
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,830
I just need you to hold
out a little longer.

269
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,120
This will all be over soon.

270
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,860
I need to pick up brian at school.

271
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,710
I won't let anything happen
to you... Or your boys.

272
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,410
You have my word.

273
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,290
Harry broke his word.

274
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,090
He wasn't called to  that
crime scene by chance.

275
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,330
It was his case.

276
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,580
Laura moser was his informant.

277
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,510
Harry knew my mother.

278
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,420
Our suspect is 6'2",380 pounds,hispanic,

279
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,900
Drives a 1971 ford pickup.

280
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,400
Circulate his dmv photo.

281
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,030
- Hey.
- Hey.

282
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,900
- I've got good news.
- Me too.

283
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,990
Turns out our vic,foster
-- he had a blog.

284
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,980
He was in some online geek flame war
With a guy calling himself "corndude."

285
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,640
The d.a. Finally signed
off on your review.

286
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,810
There won't be any charges.

287
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,110
This corndude's real
name is benjamin alvaro.

288
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,090
Anyone from the shoot roll-out
team Talk to you about counseling?

289
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,990
Why the fuck would i need counseling?

290
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,210
'Cause you shot a man last week,james.

291
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,770
That's two shootings
in less than six months.

292
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,260
Come on,it's got to take its toll.

293
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,240
I'm fine,but thanks anyway.

294
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,120
The sushi place next door has a security
camera That covers the parking lot.

295
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,180
You know,department's
chaplain's got a good ear.

296
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,970
Maria,can we stay on the goddamn point?

297
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,870
The camera caught the license
plate Of a green-and-white pickup.

298
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,380
It belongs to alvaro.

299
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,400
Timecode puts him here
after the shop closed.

300
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,720
So send some unis to
stake out alvaro's house,

301
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,340
And you and i will take where he works.

302
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,080
No,it's okay. I've got
simms and giles on it.

303
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,990
- I got backup.
- Come on!

304
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,230
It will be like old times.

305
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,180
Nina,i just got a call from my attorney.

306
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,940
We need to talk about
this visitation bullshit.

307
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,730
Can you just try dexter's office again?

308
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,830
Miss,he's not picking up.

309
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,060
Call me when you get this.

310
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,090
Excuse me. Are you a friend of dexter's?

311
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,120
I'm,uh,his decorator. Love the hat.

312
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,290
Terrence,uh,give her a visitor's badge.

313
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,220
I'll -- i'll
take her up.

314
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,470
Angel batista. I'm dexter's best friend.

315
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,640
Nice to meet you... Angel batista.

316
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,420
My work requires me  to be an
expert In analyzing patterns.

317
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,870
Now a pattern keeps emerging  from
my past That's all too familiar --

318
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,950
Harry lying to me.

319
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,590
No wonder he destroyed the
file  on my mother's death.

320
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,870
It wasn't to protect me. It
was to bury his own guilt.

321
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,940
look who i found.

322
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,730
Listen,when you're done with him,

323
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,760
Maybe you can come over to my place.

324
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,640
It's a mess. Needs a
woman's touch. Yeah?

325
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,410
What did you say to angel?

326
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,690
Dexter,these are amazing!

327
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,680
Lila,you can't be in here.

328
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,290
Did you find out what happened to the
men responsible For your mother's murder?

329
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,990
Dead or in prison
-- except for one.

330
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,060
He cut a deal. Now he
lives in naples,florida.

331
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,980
He runs a tavern.

332
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,280
And what are you gonna do about it?

333
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,380
Not sure yet.

334
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,400
And you're not the least bit pissed
off That this man got away with murder?

335
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,100
No.

336
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,740
You sure?

337
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,870
Maybe a little.

338
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,150
Then go and tell him.

339
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:27,010
Healing is all about focusing your
rage On the person that's hurt you.

340
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,140
Naples is,what...

341
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,010
Two hours away?

342
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,600
We could go tonight.

343
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,170
Okay.

344
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,800
- Pick me up after work?
- All right.

345
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,970
- Can i have one of these?
- Sure.

346
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,980
What is this stuff?

347
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,980
It's corn syrup and
dye. It's my own recipe.

348
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,180
Mmm. Not bad.

349
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,680
Thank you.

350
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,750
Oh,god!

351
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,400
Who doesn't fix something like that?

352
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,020
- You all right?
- Yeah

353
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:24,200
So,i'm thinking we're assuming our
killer owns a boat, But what if he --

354
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,900
How do you stand this miami heat?

355
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,010
Makes my toes swell up.

356
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,940
Oh,so,anyway,

357
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,220
I was thinking,what if the
killer's been renting a boat?

358
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,490
I can cross-reference
some names of --

359
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,520
You like cucumber
sandwiches,officer morgan?

360
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,940
I-i don't know.

361
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,910
Anyway,uh,we have some of the dates
Of when the victims went missing.

362
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,510
It's all about the cream cheese.

363
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,560
So we could cross-reference those
dates Against the rental logs,

364
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,600
And maybe the same names will pop up.

365
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,950
Did you hear anything i just said?

366
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,860
Not one word.

367
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,170
It's 1:00.

368
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:17,780
I always stop and eat lunch at
1:00. You'll learn that about me.

369
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,920
Why don't you sit down?

370
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:25,060
You're welcome to consider
it an order if that helps.

371
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,590
The shoes,too.

372
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,650
Shouldn't
we be --

373
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,820
I don't know --
investigating the area?

374
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,510
You're very fidgety.

375
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,400
Anyone ever tell you that?

376
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,800
Yes. My father.

377
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,260
You applying for the job?

378
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,570
Just an observation.

379
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,070
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

380
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,260
- Are you criticizing me for wanting to do my job?
- Yes.

381
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,140
It's 1:00.

382
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,140
Look,the last time i was around boats,

383
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,860
A killer was kidnapping me,

384
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,240
Which might explain why
i'm living with my brother

385
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,780
And snooping on my new boyfriend.

386
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:17,050
So forgive me for
being a little fidgety,

387
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,590
But if it's lunch we're talking,
I'm gonna eat a fat pork sandwich,

388
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,720
And i'm sure as shit
not gonna eat it here.

389
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,290
- Debra.
- What?!

390
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,160
This isn't a commercial marina.

391
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,440
I haven't seen a single rental
i.d. On any of these hulls.

392
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,840
But i can see the upkeep
on this place is dismal.

393
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,560
Unsecure perimeter,poor lighting.

394
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,420
Come out here at night,

395
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,580
No one would know what
the hell you're doing.

396
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,020
That's why i'm going to order 24-hour
surveillance On this marina and the two others.

397
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,670
As soon as i finish my lunch.

398
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,340
I finished my spatter
report,put in for a personal day,

399
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,490
Left word with rita.

400
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,040
Naples,here i come.

401
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:35,720
I can't really focus my rage On
the man  who killed my mother,

402
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,460
Not with lila along  for the ride.

403
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,990
But i can prepare for
the day  when i do.

404
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,220
Where are you off to so early?

405
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,650
Um,getting out of town for the night.

406
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,010
Don't wait up for me.

407
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,970
In the middle of the week?

408
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:52,300
Thought i'd,you know,take the
minivan out On the open road.

409
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,130
Who are you?

410
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,820
Good news is you got the place to yourself
If you want to tie up gabriel again.

411
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,100
Yeah,that one never fucking gets old.

412
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,810
Call me when you get back. I want
to talk to you about coral cove.

413
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,150
What about coral cove?

414
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,890
The algae on the rocks sent us there.

415
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,150
If i were you,i would seriously
consider moving your boat.

416
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,840
Security out there sucks ass.

417
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,130
That's kind of the point.

418
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:18,450
This little green algae
may as well be kryptonite.

419
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,220
If it's ever traced back
to me,i'll be helpless.

420
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,630
Is this a rental?

421
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,910
Nope,she's all mine.

422
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,660
So your minivan's a she,is she?

423
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,440
Your girlfriend must be jealous.

424
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,650
Is she cool with you doing this?

425
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,640
I didn't tell her.

426
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,590
Rita's mom found out i'm in recovery.

427
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,020
She wants me to leave rita and the kids.

428
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,790
She could be right.

429
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,540
I can't abandon them.

430
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:07,730
So,what about what you're gonna
say to this guy When you get there?

431
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,610
I'm sure i'll think of something.

432
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,240
Why don't you practice on me?

433
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,270
I'd...rather not.

434
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,290
Just try.

435
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,490
Out loud.

436
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,780
I feel like...

437
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,760
...you stole my life.

438
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,050
And?

439
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:55,020
I'm not the person i'm supposed to be.

440
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,500
It's like i'm hollow.

441
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,790
That's good.

442
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,430
Go on.

443
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,360
I hide in plain sight...

444
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:22,500
...unable to reach out to people...

445
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,410
Close to me.

446
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,810
I'm afraid...

447
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,490
...i'll hurt them.

448
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,520
Like i've hurt so many others.

449
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,790
This is what he made me become.

450
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:58,690
Then that's what you should tell him.

451
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,720
What do you remember
most about your mother?

452
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,290
She had long hair.

453
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,080
Soft...

454
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,780
...like her hands.

455
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,760
That's all.

456
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,460
Yup... Just like old times.

457
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,380
You live for this and you know it.

458
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,750
We could always get in the car
And pass the time like we used to.

459
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,720
No. No.

460
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,650
I'm not going down  that road again.

461
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,800
code 1,suspect's
vehicle spotted --

462
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,300
- one on board.Headed your way.
- Copy that.

463
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,230
- I'll take lead.
- I got it.

464
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,580
We don't want this guy to do
anything stupid In a crowd of people.

465
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,510
Goddamn,that's what you out
here for -- to babysit me?

466
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,220
I'm out here because
i'm worried about you.

467
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:19,200
How many fucking ways to sunday Do i
have to tell you that i'm fine,maria?

468
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,440
Yeah,and that's what worries me.

469
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,080
You're fine with killing
two men? You're fine?

470
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,960
Been more than two.

471
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,970
This isn't the army,james.
This is my department.

472
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,680
I need to know that you are fit for
duty. That's my job as a lieutenant!

473
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,970
That's all you care about is your job,

474
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,280
Even if it meant doing
pascal's man to get it back.

475
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,520
How did you know about bertrand?

476
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,270
I didn't for sure until just now.

477
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,950
I know you,maria. We rode
together for two years.

478
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,160
When you want something,you get it.

479
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,490
Pascal was in your way.

480
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,820
We're not talking about this.

481
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,530
You all up in everybody else's
shit As long as it ain't yours.

482
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,440
There's alvaro.

483
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,990
Wait until he gets out of the car.

484
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,330
How long you gonna keep wiping my ass?

485
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,920
Until i see my old partner again.

486
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,340
On my go.

487
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,200
- On the ground,motherfucker!
- Hands where i can see,alvaro!

488
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,210
remember,this is about you.

489
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,380
Not about him.

490
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,470
It's all right if we get there
And you can't go through with this.

491
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,540
I know.

492
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,690
- 'Cause we can come back another time.
- No.

493
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,050
I want to meet him tonight.

494
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,780
This isn't art. This is cottage porn.

495
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,470
That's rita.

496
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,180
Say no more. I need to
take a shower anyway.

497
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,970
Don't leave without saying goodbye.

498
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,690
- Hi.
- Hey.

499
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,840
It's so good to hear your voice.
I was starting to get worried.

500
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,690
You still on the road?

501
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,330
No,i just got in.

502
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,000
Oh. Well,you said you'd call.

503
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,220
Where are you?

504
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,350
I decided to look up
someone from my past.

505
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,840
- That's what suddenly came up?
- Yep.

506
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,390
Dexter,what's going on?

507
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,800
Well,after this morning,

508
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,000
I figured it'd be better
if i kept my distance.

509
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,250
What -- what
happened this morning?

510
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,340
Let's just say your mom isn't
a big fan of men in recovery.

511
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,070
Oh,shit.

512
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,310
Look,this means nothing,okay?

513
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,150
I'm gonna take care of this.

514
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,230
Now,when are you coming back?

515
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,790
Uh,tomorrow morning.

516
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,360
Promise me you'll stop
by the house first thing?

517
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,960
Sure.

518
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,950
I'm so sorry about this,dexter.

519
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,480
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

520
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,480
Why are you not in the shower?

521
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:39,220
I know. I'm just checking some e-mails.

522
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,030
We have to be at the
restaurant in half an hour.

523
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,530
Sure you don't want to join me?

524
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,460
You stink.

525
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Thought you liked it dirty

526
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,140
"ice princess"?

527
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,280
Fuck.

528
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,590

529
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,990
You son of a bitch!

530
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,140
Deb,what did i do?

531
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,320
You lied to me! You're a writer!

532
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,780
I-i'm trying to be,yeah!

533
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,530
I saw all of those e-mails
you sent to those publishers --

534
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,700
The ice princess!

535
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,050
Oh,you went through my e-mail!

536
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,500
All you wanted was to
get close enough to me

537
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,500
So you could sell a book about
me and the ice-truck killer!

538
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,170
That's crazy,deb.
Those letters --

539
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,760
Fuck you!  Fuck you!

540
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,190
Deb!

541
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,310
What can i do you for?

542
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,100
- Drink?
- Beer. Whatever's on tap.

543
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:45,060
Una frÌA,coming up.

544
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,300
- Way to ditch me.
- You were in the shower.

545
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,370
So,are you there? Do you see him?

546
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,790
He's staring at me.

547
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,780
You gonna say something?

548
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,420
I don't know what i'm gonna do yet.

549
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,830
I should go.

550
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,750
Well,call me when you
figure it out. All right?

551
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,610
Three bucks.

552
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,210
you had no right!

553
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,530
He's an addict,rita.
He is no good for you!

554
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,790
He's already got you smoking again.

555
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,560
You turned your back on
me  and your grandchildren.

556
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,780
That was not my fault.

557
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:59,130
I tried to warn you about paul,
But you ran away with him anyway.

558
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,550
I wasn't running away with paul.

559
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,420
I was running away from you.

560
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:12,870
Do you have any idea how much it hurts me
To see you make the same mistakes again?

561
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,980
I've had my fair share of mistakes.

562
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,960
And guess what -- you
were right about paul.

563
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,270
He was a terrible man.

564
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,760
But for the first time,i
feel safe and loved,

565
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:30,370
And that's because of dexter.

566
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,970
I can't talk to you when you're
like this. I'm going to bed.

567
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,100
This is my life,mother.

568
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,250
If you can't be happy for me,
Then maybe you shouldn't be here.

569
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,950
If you want to abandon me
and the kids again,fine.

570
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,590
That's your choice.

571
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,040
But dexter is not going anywhere.

572
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,730
Last call was 30 minutes ago.

573
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,140
You hear me?

574
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,110
I need you to finish that up.

575
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,650
Sorry.

576
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,820
I'm avoiding going
back to my motel room.

577
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:31,160
I'm visiting from miami.

578
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,420
You ever been there?

579
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,140
I can't say that i have.

580
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,490
How long you lived in naples?

581
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,960
- Oh,a few years now.
- You like it?

582
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:58,070
All right,co—O. Go.

583
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,900
Okay. This is gonna be awkward.

584
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,900
I need to tell you how i feel.

585
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,700
No,what you need to do is leave

586
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:12,450
Because you been
eyeballing me all night.

587
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,220
You really shouldn't do that.

588
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,720
I said get out of my bar.

589
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:23,020
Okay. Just let me say what
i need to say,and i'll go.

590
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,500
You stole my life.

591
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,220
what the fuck?

592
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,290
You are really beginning to piss me off.

593
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,070
I'm not the person i'm supposed to
be Because you took someone from me.

594
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,450
I will beat your fucking head in

595
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,060
If you don't walk out
that door right now!

596
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,390
I tried lila's way.

597
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,090
1973!

598
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,690
The port of miami!

599
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,560
A shipping container!

600
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,750
A chain saw!

601
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,950
Laura moser!

602
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:15,440
You remember now? You remember now?

603
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,160
Puta madre.

604
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:36,310
You got me confused with someone else!

605
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,750
I know exactly who you are!
You made me into what i am!

606
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,180
Okay! I-i killed her.

607
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,730
I had to!

608
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,200
Did you? Did you have to?

609
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,310
Did you have to saw
her into little pieces?!

610
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,890
Did you have to leave two little boys
Soaking in a pool of their mother's blood?

611
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,100
Estrada would have
killed me if i didn't.

612
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:05,410
You slaughtered her like an animal
Because she stole his precious cocaine.

613
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:11,120
No. We found out she
was a snitch for a cop.

614
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,440
She was fucking him.

615
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,990
Which cop?

616
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,610
I didn't know his name.

617
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,820
I followed them
to -- to a park.

618
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:25,130
My mother and harry --
that's what got her killed?

619
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,420
I'm not done with you yet.

620
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,790
Isn't this what heroes do
--  avenge lost loved ones?

621
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,450
What?

622
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,530
Everything okay?

623
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,930
Dexter,what's wrong?

624
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,340
I thought i could resist.

625
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,200
Jesus...are you using?

626
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:58,470
No,but i'm about to.

627
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,120
Tell me where you are

628
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:04,040
And i'll get in a taxi
and i'll come get you.

629
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,880
I have to do this.

630
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:10,300
No,you don't! Just
tell me where you are.

631
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,260
You'll be too late.

632
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:19,000
Don't you bloody do this.
You are stronger than that.

633
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,590
I'm not!

634
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,240
Yes,you fucking are.

635
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,490
You've come this far.

636
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,990
If you turn back now,

637
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,330
You'll go right back
to the way you were --

638
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:36,140
Hollow,angry, Alone.

639
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,210
I will get you through this. I swear.

640
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,620
Just come back to me. Okay?

641
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,540
Dexter? Are you all right?

642
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,230
It's okay.

643
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,010
I didn't...

644
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,220
It's okay.

645
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,620
I don't care what you did.

646
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,360
It's okay.

647
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,570
It's okay.

648
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:39,090
Baby.

649
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,290
It's okay.

650
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,920
What are you still doing here?

651
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,050
Making sure our marina
surveillance is in place.

652
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,190
You forget something?

653
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,350
I'm working up rental logs...

654
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,790
...on the other two marinas.

655
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,420
- You don't give up,do you?
- Do you?

656
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,280
I'm wide awake anyway.
Dexter's out of town.

657
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,270
I don't really sleep
when i'm there by myself.

658
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,610
What about the new boyfriend?

659
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,650
We sort of broke up.

660
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,430
Well,i broke up with him.

661
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,620
Guess you won't be needing  this,then.

662
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,890
What's that?

663
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,530
Background check.

664
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,900
You said you sere snooping.
Just thought i'd help.

665
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:32,390
You ran a background
check on my boyfriend?

666
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,210
What's it say?

667
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,510
Gabriel's
clean --

668
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,050
Well,except for those parking tickets.

669
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:45,730
Just because he's not a criminal
Doesn't mean he's not an asshole.

670
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,420
I went through his e-mail.

671
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:51,350
I know,but it was worth it.I mean...

672
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:56,650
he was using me to shop around a
book About the ice-truck killer.

673
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,720
Do you know what kind
of writer gabriel is?

674
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:12,300
Children's books?

675
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:19,400
"the ice princess" is a children's book.

676
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:25,530
How could i be so fucking stupid?

677
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:31,770
When my wife met me,she
was convinced i was a spy.

678
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,440
Connie didn't know it,but
she was actually right.

679
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,870
You ran a background check on her?

680
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,920
- no need.
- Must be nice...

681
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,340
To just know like that.

682
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:50,020
She died...two years ago.

683
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,960
Cancer.

684
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,970
I'm sorry.

685
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,660
That's how i lost my mom.

686
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:06,960
I should go.

687
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:10,070
Let me ask you something.

688
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,640
That boyfriend
of yours --

689
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,280
- Did he ever give you a reason not to trust him?
- No.

690
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:24,520
But i don't think it matters.
I mean,i went insane on him.

691
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,260
He'll never forgive me.

692
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:31,380
Any broken bones involved?
Facial contusions?

693
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,170
No.

694
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,400
You'll be fine.

695
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:17,460
Do you want to know how
i got into the program?

696
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,700
I'd used
for years --

697
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:31,420
Binge,crash.

698
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:34,230
Thought i had it under control.

699
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:38,550
Then i met marco.

700
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,470
What a shit.

701
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,030
Thought he was my boyfriend,

702
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,370
But he turned out to be my dealer.

703
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:57,020
Bastard had me so strung
out by the time he left,

704
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:59,390
Nothing mattered.

705
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:04,200
Nothing was left...

706
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,750
...but rage.

707
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,970
One night...

708
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:17,960
I was so fucked
up -- god.

709
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:26,540
I went to his house,and
i burned it to the ground.

710
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:34,840
What i didn't know was that
marco was passed out inside.

711
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:44,840
They blamed the fire on his drugs.

712
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:50,530
But it was me.

713
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,160
He died because of me.

714
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:04,730
That night,i went to my first meeting.

715
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,420
Seeing that side of
myself was terrifying.

716
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:18,100
That i could possibly do
that to another person.

717
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,850
Did he deserve it?

718
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,640
Yes.

719
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:51,460
Then you didn't do anything wrong.

720
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:18,030
Hey,you.

721
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,330
I wasn't expecting you this early.

722
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,540
I didn't hit any traffic.

723
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:25,680
You're just in time for breakfast.

724
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,560
Where's your mom?

725
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:33,510
Oh,i doubt she'll be joining us.

726
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,200
She's been in her room all morning.

727
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:39,770
My guess is she's packing.

728
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,560
Maybe i should go.

729
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,060
No.

730
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:51,200
No,you're staying right here
Because you're a part of this family.

731
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:56,410
Are you sure? I've put
you through so much lately.

732
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:03,170
I'm here for you,dexter...
No matter what.

733
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,090
What's this?

734
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,800
The patch.

735
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,980
I have some quitting
of my own to do. Sit.

736
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:23,880
Is that anything important?

737
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:27,390
WHEN'S THE NEXT ROAD TRIP?

738
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:29,870
Nope.

739
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,300
Morning.

740
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:37,140
Morning,dexter.

741
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,970
Hi...gail.

742
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:47,250
So,rita assures me that you
are committed to getting better.

743
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,480
I am.

744
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:54,110
Then i want to be here to help.

745
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:57,960
In fact,i've decided to stay in miami.

746
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,390
I e-mailed the school board My
letter of resignation this morning.

747
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,820
What about your house?

748
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:07,010
I'll put it on the market.

749
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,700
Sweetie,i thought about
what you said last night.

750
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:13,360
I haven't been here for
you,and i want to change that.

751
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,240
You know,my sister's
looking for a new apartment.

752
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,000
I'm sure we can help you find one,too.

753
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:22,350
Well,don't be silly.
I'll be living here.

754
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,510
Dexter,be a dear and
pass me the cream,please.

755
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,090
Thank you.

756
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,370
Harry taught me to lie

757
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,830
And keep my darkest secrets
 from those around me...

758
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,670
Which is why i need  to make sure There's
not a trace  of blood left on my boat.

759
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,100
He also taught me  not
to rush to judgment.

760
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:49,360
Things aren't always
what they appear to be...

761
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:52,820
...including harry.

762
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,500
And what about me?

763
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,620
Am i the twisted  bay harbor butcher...

764
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,810
Or the valiant dark defender?

765
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,140
Only time will tell.

766
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:06,880
Funny thing is i've met someone
 who doesn't care what i am.

767
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,170
I suppose every hero
 needs a sidekick...

768
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:14,070
Every villain,a partner in crime.

769
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:20,570
All my relationships have
been  built on not knowing.

770
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,690
But that may be changing.

771
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:32,780
Imagine that --  a life
with no more secrets.
