1
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:10,580
- Hey, Pete, you needed me?
- [Jessup] Do I have to...

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,040
[Broward] We're moving tonight.
A raid.

3
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,836
Garmen Harry reached out
to Ron Cuneo again.

4
00:00:16,836 --> 00:00:20,882
Uh, you know, from the casino
and, uh, I was right.

5
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:24,594
The Mahabir family is closing
up shop pretty quickly.

6
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:27,764
Uh, we're gonna use NYPD
vehicles. We can't wait for...

7
00:00:27,764 --> 00:00:28,931
ours to be dispatched.

8
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:31,601
Wow.

9
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:35,313
Okay, so [stammers] we're
running point?

10
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:37,523
[Sanders] Mm-hmm. Postal
Inspectors are running point...

11
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:38,816
but we are there to support.

12
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:46,240
All right. Um, FBI, you guys are
gonna go for the bank...

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,493
statements and hard drives, and
account records.

14
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:49,994
Do you need us to vouch
for that shit?

15
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:51,788
Or do you guys want to
attack it for yourself?

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,081
Well, actually, it's...

17
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:56,334
No, you're not expecting to find
anything because Savitri...

18
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:58,544
Mahabir wouldn't have all
that lying around.

19
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:03,883
Except no...
[deep breath]

20
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:08,805
that is not what that
actually is about.

21
00:01:10,097 --> 00:01:13,851
Actually, you guys mind giving
Inspector Harmony and me...

22
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:14,852
the room for a moment?

23
00:01:14,852 --> 00:01:15,895
- [Sanders]
Yeah.
- [Broward] Nope.

24
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:19,273
[Broward clears throat]

25
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:29,158
Surprised it took him this long.
[exhales]

26
00:01:29,158 --> 00:01:33,162
Um, sorry, mine and Manny's...

27
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:36,582
informant is trying to yank off
his anklet. [annoyed chuckle]

28
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,751
Do you mind giving me a second?

29
00:01:41,712 --> 00:01:45,216
Yo, Xavier. Your phone is off
and that is good...

30
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:49,178
but I know what you're doing,
and I see where you are...

31
00:01:49,178 --> 00:01:52,265
and I'll know if you leave. So,
when you get this, call me...

32
00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:54,851
back because we're due for
a checkup. Okay?

33
00:01:57,937 --> 00:01:59,772
Uh, you know, actually,
can you, um...

34
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:02,483
Sorry. Just-Just one more call.
Sorry about that.

35
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:08,698
Hi, yes, room 924, please. It's
listed as House Anonymous.

36
00:02:09,073 --> 00:02:09,991
Thank you.

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,329
[haunting instrumental music plays]

38
00:02:21,294 --> 00:02:22,420
Um...

39
00:02:24,088 --> 00:02:28,968
this talk, where you're gonna
tell me that Manny is point...

40
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:31,679
and I am not or something along
those lines.

41
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:32,847
Can it wait an hour?

42
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:34,724
Everything okay?

43
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:39,604
I'm gonna let you know.
I'm sorry, Pete.

44
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:49,196
[whispers] Fuck.

45
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:56,871
[music intensifies]

46
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:12,178
Fuck.

47
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:17,475
[forceful exhales]
[forceful breaths]

48
00:03:19,268 --> 00:03:22,480
Xavier? Hello? Xavier?

49
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:25,983
USPIS.

50
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:34,909
Fuck.
[exhales]

51
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:41,040
[Garmen] First, you tell me what
you were doing there and...

52
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,000
how you ended up with
an ankle monitor on.

53
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:45,753
A lady grab me.

54
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:48,172
What she want with you?
How-How you know she?

55
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:52,385
I don't know. Maybe she
see me outside your house.

56
00:03:52,385 --> 00:03:55,054
How she know you were there?
Huh?

57
00:03:55,846 --> 00:03:59,850
- Because she was following Aked.
- Oh, Aked. Oh, how? How? How?

58
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:03,396
Hmm? She pick you up by
sheself. No one else was there.

59
00:04:03,396 --> 00:04:04,355
Why?

60
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:07,024
I think she was acting
on her own.

61
00:04:07,024 --> 00:04:09,318
- Uh-huh.
- I don't think anybody know.

62
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:14,699
What you tell she?
What you tell she?

63
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,744
[grunts] Nothing, man. Nothing.
She knows everything. All right?

64
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:20,413
She-She-She...
[stammers]

65
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:22,039
She have-She have...
She-She know about...

66
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:24,333
"She-She-She"... What? What?
What? You can't talk?

67
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,627
And she know about the bum
we killed in the alley.

68
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:29,297
She have pictures of you and
Mrs. Mahabir. She have...

69
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:31,757
pictures of Quincy, and Ranwell,
and lots of people. No, man.

70
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:33,134
What about me?

71
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:35,469
Nothing. I didn't see
nothing about you.

72
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:37,638
- How about Len?
- Nothing.

73
00:04:37,638 --> 00:04:40,224
Hey, why you not call me
when she left?

74
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:44,645
Because I know a lot of people
be after you. All right?

75
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:48,024
I thought maybe she might bug
the room or-or-or tag...

76
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:49,984
my calls, you know?
[heavy breaths]

77
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,989
Look, you know I want to go home
more than anything...

78
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:58,659
but why would I mess that up for
some crazy cop lady who's...

79
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:01,078
trying to keep me a secret from
her own people? [heavy breaths]

80
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:10,087
Paul, [exhales] I'm leaving
with me family.

81
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,215
Are you taking him with you?

82
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:16,552
Maybe. Question is whose side
is he on really.

83
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:18,679
Hmm?

84
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,473
[Xavier takes a deep breath]

85
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:26,645
What you do?

86
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:31,567
{\an8}They been calling me
from Jared's phone.

87
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:42,953
Xavier. Thank you for calling.

88
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:45,623
I'm sorry I ain't been
connecting with you.

89
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:50,795
Me hear your message. You say
you got plans to leave?

90
00:05:52,296 --> 00:05:53,756
[heavy breaths] <i>We trying
everything, Xav.</i>

91
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:58,094
We asked Edward Chung to help,
but it was a trap.

92
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:03,599
Was it you that, uh, that
swapped out Jared's body for...

93
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:04,642
some kind of dummy?

94
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,229
[crying breaths] I'm sorry.
We-We didn't think no one...

95
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:10,189
would know. I'm sorry, we...

96
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:13,901
I'm sorry, we didn't tell you.
We-We-We-We were scared.

97
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:17,446
[sniffles] [exhales]

98
00:06:18,364 --> 00:06:20,783
How much was Edward Chung
charging to take you?

99
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:23,285
<i>Nothing.</i>

100
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:26,288
He was charging you nothing and
you didn't think it...

101
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:27,706
was some kind of trap, no?

102
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,544
It was my fault, Xavier. You
know me not clever like that.

103
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:33,629
Me sorry, man. Me so sorry.

104
00:06:34,421 --> 00:06:35,589
And you say you're
getting money?

105
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:37,675
[whispers] Fifty-thousand.

106
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:39,552
Can you get him 50?

107
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:43,472
Maybe. Can try.

108
00:06:44,515 --> 00:06:46,976
<i>Why? Why you ask?</i>

109
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:50,604
All right, well, Garmen Harry is
desperate for money...

110
00:06:50,604 --> 00:06:51,897
and him leave tonight.

111
00:06:52,857 --> 00:06:56,527
Him say if he has space on his
plane and he say "yes," can...

112
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:57,570
you get him 50?

113
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,655
Yeah, we can try.
[heavy breaths]

114
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:06,996
Okay, I'm gonna put you on mute.

115
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:13,752
[exhales] How many
seats you get?

116
00:07:13,752 --> 00:07:16,255
Five seater.
My family and one more.

117
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,259
[cell phone speaker chimes on]

118
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:23,262
[exhales] All right, Louis.
[clears throat]

119
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,849
Garmen has assessed 60 thousand.

120
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:28,601
And he leave at
midnight tonight.

121
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:30,352
Imma call you when you
get the money.

122
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,772
So Garmen know about
Edward Chung?

123
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:36,567
No.

124
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,777
And I won't tell him.

125
00:07:39,945 --> 00:07:41,197
I promise.

126
00:07:47,786 --> 00:07:48,662
Hey...
[slight cough]

127
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:53,250
keep this hush-hush, right?
Because you know mouth open...

128
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,251
story jump out.

129
00:07:55,544 --> 00:07:57,922
- Will do.
- All right. I'll see you later.

130
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:02,384
[clears throat]
Hannah-Estelle... [exhales]

131
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:06,513
you remember Xavier? He's going
to help you load stuff.

132
00:08:06,513 --> 00:08:08,057
He's the fifth seat on
the plane and...

133
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:10,100
maybe he can help us when
we get back home too.

134
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:11,894
[doorbell rings]
[knock on door]

135
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:13,938
That's probably them.

136
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:16,774
[Gene takes deep breaths]

137
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:24,698
[Kristin] Thanks for seeing us, Cindy.

138
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:27,284
Yeah, well...
[kisses]

139
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:32,414
Okay. Come on.

140
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:35,125
[Kristin sighs]

141
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:38,212
Wow.

142
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,924
If you're this old what the fuck
does that make me?

143
00:08:41,924 --> 00:08:42,925
[Jeff chuckles]

144
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:44,802
Not you, Kris. You look good.

145
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:48,973
So, why are we the most popular
people on the planet...

146
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:51,517
all of a sudden? Ah.
[chuckles]

147
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:53,978
- You know what? I bet I know.
- All right. Gene.

148
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:59,566
You're right. You're right.
Sorry. That's a...

149
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:04,571
Cindy gave me the comportment
lecture, so, I'm comporting.

150
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:06,699
Would you like to have a seat?

151
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,294
[Jeff groans]

152
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:23,299
[exhales] Well, we just want to
know what really happened.

153
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:25,426
[Jeff exhales]
[Gene chuckles]

154
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:27,386
And you come to us for this?

155
00:09:27,386 --> 00:09:30,347
Well, in my mind, uh...

156
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:35,853
you know, uh... And it's gotten
worse by the way. I-I...

157
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:39,064
- And I'm sorry to hear.
- Really. All this. I...

158
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:44,069
From the moment that I got that
call that they got Jared.

159
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:46,947
I got that call, and then I'm
running to Sam's, and then...

160
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:51,285
And you thought, "My brother."
Because you felt guilty.

161
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,496
- For what?
- Guilty for turning me in!

162
00:09:54,496 --> 00:09:56,498
- Oh. [scoffs]
- No!

163
00:09:56,498 --> 00:10:00,085
I'm gonna save you some breath.
I've got the 49 report.

164
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:01,086
I've got...

165
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:04,882
I have a Xerox of an interview
that he did with Manny Broward.

166
00:10:04,882 --> 00:10:06,258
An interview with who?

167
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:08,260
Twenty some years ago
when you turned me in...

168
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,137
you did an interview with a
police detective named...

169
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:11,138
Manfred Broward.

170
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:13,140
- I-I don't know who that is.
- Oh, stop.

171
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:17,311
Just save-save your dignity.
Will you? I'll get it for you.

172
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:20,564
Here we go. It's a witness form
that you fill out if you...

173
00:10:20,564 --> 00:10:23,359
want to sweep something under
the rug. And a lot of the...

174
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,360
details are redacted...

175
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,572
but believe me, Jeff, there is
plenty here. There is plenty.

176
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:32,993
Case in point, "I met with
subject initials...

177
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:35,037
"J.M. who has requested
anonymity."

178
00:10:35,037 --> 00:10:36,705
I never met with...
Seriously. I never met with...

179
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:39,875
"And who has confirmed payments...

180
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,253
-"initiated by J.M. to...
- I don't know what that is.

181
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:46,507
"...an account redacted..." I was
never supposed to see this.

182
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:48,050
And you assumed that I hadn't.

183
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,596
Ah! I never handle the accounts.
Ever!

184
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:56,266
Oh, well then I guess it was
some other J.M. at...

185
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:57,893
Jeffrey McCusker Foods then.

186
00:10:57,893 --> 00:10:59,311
Oh my God!

187
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:06,235
God. We owe you an apology.

188
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:07,778
- What?
- Don't we?

189
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:09,613
[exhales]

190
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:11,907
Yeah, we didn't see it either.

191
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:15,119
Gene... [exhales]

192
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:19,581
Samantha is her middle name.

193
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,752
She always hated "Jolene."

194
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:28,215
It was "Sam" from the time
she was three I think.

195
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:42,062
[heavy breaths] Um...

196
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:48,068
[exhales]

197
00:11:51,363 --> 00:11:53,615
[Sam] Mom, I understand this is
a conversation we all need...

198
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:55,784
to have. I just can't have it
right now. Okay?

199
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:58,412
Derek just walked in.
I'll-I'll call you later. Bye.

200
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,251
What was that all about?

201
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:06,837
Everything. [scoffs]

202
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:11,091
Are we gonna talk?

203
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:13,510
Sure. Me first. You need to go.

204
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:15,929
- We can make this...
- No, you need to leave!

205
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:17,931
- I want to make this work.
- There's only one thing I want.

206
00:12:17,931 --> 00:12:20,058
It's for you to get
out of my sight.

207
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:24,146
[Harmony] Oh God.

208
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:28,817
This is the talk. From earlier.

209
00:12:30,444 --> 00:12:32,779
You're telling me that Manny's
in charge of the raid.

210
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:36,033
Actually, it's because of
something I got this morning.

211
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:38,827
Manny's not running point?

212
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:43,832
No, he is. But it's
something else.

213
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:48,170
He sent the psych eval.

214
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:52,299
Damn it.

215
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:57,054
I knew he would do it
eventually. [exhales]

216
00:12:58,138 --> 00:13:00,891
And I almost fired him for not
having sent it a year ago...

217
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:02,684
when he should have, but I
needed at least one...

218
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:04,686
of you on the raid tonight.

219
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:09,691
Until you got the thing that
we're about to talk about.

220
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:14,655
Mel, we got an IAB report about
a domestic incident...

221
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:15,572
case against you.

222
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:19,660
Carol?

223
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:25,040
And given it's the third
one in as many years...

224
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,168
with last year's leading
to the psych eval...

225
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,340
Did she include how we met?

226
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:37,219
How she was a witness in
one of your cases? Yeah.

227
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,388
- [exhales] Oh my God.
- Which of course...

228
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:42,808
just adds to the messiness. And
given the times and...

229
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:43,850
our other issues...

230
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:46,603
Yeah.

231
00:13:48,063 --> 00:13:49,731
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, no, no.

232
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:52,734
I'm-I'm sorry.

233
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:59,741
I did this to myself. I get it.
I did this.

234
00:14:01,868 --> 00:14:04,121
You'll officially be suspended
as of noon tomorrow...

235
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:05,831
pending a department investigation.

236
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,166
[slow instrumental music plays]

237
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,501
[Aked exhales]

238
00:15:10,562 --> 00:15:11,688
[Gene & Jeff chuckle]

239
00:15:12,564 --> 00:15:14,441
Uh, table for two, please.

240
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:16,652
I'm sorry. We're fully committed.

241
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:17,903
Do you have a reservation?

242
00:15:18,862 --> 00:15:22,658
Actually, I have a few,
but we came anyway.

243
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:25,285
Actually, can you hang a sec?

244
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:26,453
Mm-hmm. Sure.

245
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:29,873
- Okay...
- What?

246
00:15:29,873 --> 00:15:33,502
...what's about to happen now is
the best part of the whole deal.

247
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:38,298
Mr. McCusker, it is a true
honor to have you here.

248
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:39,549
- Oh, thank you.
- Please.

249
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,760
- [chuckles] Go ahead, Bro.
- Please. [laughs]

250
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:46,682
Holy Toledo. Are you fucking
kidding me? [chuckles]

251
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:51,603
Gene tried private security
for a while.

252
00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:53,188
You know, jobs where
he could sit.

253
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:56,733
- Yeah.
- Schools. Jewelry stores.

254
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,110
Oh. It was worse, huh?

255
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:02,948
So finally he just had to
accept the fact that... [scoffs]

256
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:07,494
You were gonna be the
breadwinner. Sorry.

257
00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:11,957
No, he did. And I was. So...

258
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:15,669
Hey, here's to...

259
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:18,088
Whatever the fuck [chuckling]
just happened.

260
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:19,089
Yeah.

261
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:25,345
What if he still doesn't pay?
Have you thought about that?

262
00:16:25,345 --> 00:16:26,972
Shut up! I'm sick of you.

263
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:28,849
- I'm just saying...
- Nicholas!

264
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,519
Your dad don't want to pay, we
still give you back.

265
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:33,937
Even without the money.

266
00:16:33,937 --> 00:16:35,522
What if I don't want to go back?

267
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:36,481
Hey!

268
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:41,403
Raas scunt. You going back!

269
00:16:51,288 --> 00:16:52,873
Okay, so, this what we gonna do.

270
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:56,501
We gonna take you inside,
we gonna knock on they door.

271
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:58,670
What apartment they in?

272
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,797
I don't know. Six something.

273
00:17:00,797 --> 00:17:03,216
Tell me now. What apartment

274
00:17:03,216 --> 00:17:04,092
Louis.

275
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:08,430
- Eighteen J.
- Let go of him. Let go.

276
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,439
That's him. That's your daddy?

277
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:33,622
Go. Go! Go! They isn't inside.
Go! Go!

278
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:42,547
[Derek] <i>Um, I just wanted to say
I love you and...</i>

279
00:18:11,868 --> 00:18:13,286
Me will come back just now.

280
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:45,569
[Natalia exhales]

281
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:55,287
[deep breath]

282
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:01,793
Sir? I'm so sorry for the wait.
Your suite's ready.

283
00:19:01,793 --> 00:19:05,380
You'll be on the third floor.
Room 309.

284
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,464
Thank you.

285
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:07,883
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thanks.

286
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:17,267
[deep breath]

287
00:19:24,941 --> 00:19:28,570
You're upset obviously and
you're not taking my calls...

288
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,614
or replying to my messages.

289
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:34,451
And this is another that you're
not even gonna listen to...

290
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:38,121
so what am I doing? [sighs]

291
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:40,040
[knock on door]

292
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,877
- Yeah?
- [Natalia] Mr. Browne?

293
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,592
[deep breath] Coming.
[exhales]

294
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,810
We got your boy. And we know you
don't want nothing to do with...

295
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,312
him so we gonna make
you an offer.

296
00:20:03,313 --> 00:20:04,689
You have my boy?

297
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:07,400
Yes. And this is your other
boy's phone.

298
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:12,280
- Who are you?
- Doesn't matter.

299
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,281
You gonna let us in?

300
00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:15,408
Us?

301
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,748
- Hey, Dad.
- Oh Jesus.

302
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:25,752
We coming in or not?

303
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:30,215
Yeah. Yeah, come on.

304
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:37,597
Okay.

305
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,850
Okay, okay. All right.

306
00:20:42,602 --> 00:20:43,687
[exhales] Fuck.

307
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:46,231
First thing we're gonna do is
you're gonna call your mother.

308
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:47,607
He ain't calling nobody.

309
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:48,942
Look, let me make a call.

310
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:51,569
You ain't making no phone call
until we get a deal.

311
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:55,365
We know you paid a lot of money
so nobody knew about him.

312
00:20:55,824 --> 00:20:59,244
All we ask is you pay again.
It's gonna be 60 thousand.

313
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:01,371
Or we gon' tell everybody.

314
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:03,456
Okay, well, why don't you go
ahead and do that then...

315
00:21:03,456 --> 00:21:05,750
because everybody fucking knows
because you guys called...

316
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,960
my house last night.

317
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,337
Sorry.

318
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,673
Hey!

319
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,675
[Aked] Yo, Jared!

320
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:22,392
Where is she?

321
00:21:22,392 --> 00:21:24,602
Where is who? Who are you?

322
00:21:25,228 --> 00:21:26,563
- Huh?
- Okay. Okay.

323
00:21:26,563 --> 00:21:27,856
[panicked breaths]

324
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:30,942
[impact grunts]
[Derek groans]

325
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:34,863
Where the fuck is she? Don't
play with me. [heavy breaths]

326
00:21:35,697 --> 00:21:37,115
[Natalia cries]

327
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:45,248
Give me. [heavy breaths]

328
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:54,382
Nat?

329
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:58,511
[Natalia cries]

330
00:22:06,436 --> 00:22:07,729
You lied to me.

331
00:22:09,814 --> 00:22:12,484
You made an ass out of me,
but you lied to me, Nat.

332
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:20,909
[cries] I'm sorry, Aked. Please.
Please don't do this. Please.

333
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:22,660
You left me with no option.

334
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:25,622
[attack yells]

335
00:22:25,622 --> 00:22:26,790
[Natalia gasps] [cries]

336
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,458
[gun fires]
[fight grunts]

337
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:32,212
[gun fires]

338
00:22:34,923 --> 00:22:36,716
[labored breaths]

339
00:22:37,842 --> 00:22:39,219
[Natalia gasps]
[panicked crying breaths]

340
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:40,386
[Louis breathes heavily]

341
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:49,979
[Natalia sobs]
[Aked with labored breaths]

342
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,989
I'm sorry.

343
00:23:00,448 --> 00:23:03,576
Just get out. Get the fuck out.

344
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:08,498
- Me sister phone.
- Just get the fuck out.

345
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:20,218
Come, come, come, Nat.
Come, come. Come on.

346
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:38,278
[Natalia with panicked breaths]

347
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:50,748
[Natalia sobs]

348
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:55,086
[Louis] Please.
[panicked breaths]

349
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:06,347
<i>- Louis.</i>
- Xav.

350
00:24:07,223 --> 00:24:08,558
Something bad happened.

351
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:13,354
We ain't get the money.
Aked dead.

352
00:24:13,354 --> 00:24:15,523
What you talk about Aked dead, man?

353
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:18,943
<i>He tried to kill Nat.
Point a gun towards she.</i>

354
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:20,570
Oh my Jesus Christ.
What the raas, Louis?

355
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:23,114
Aked dead. We ain't got
any money.

356
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:26,659
You think Garmen still gon'
take us home?

357
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:28,912
<i>Man, how you ask that?
I don't know. [exhales]</i>

358
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:34,292
- The painting.
- What?

359
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:36,502
[exhales] [sniffles] Xavier...

360
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,300
[crying] um, [sniffles]
there's a-there's a painting.

361
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,303
There's a painting worth five
times that much money.

362
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,055
We can take it.

363
00:24:47,055 --> 00:24:49,807
I don't know. Me have to ask
him. All right?

364
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:52,977
Jesus Christ. It's getting all
too much.

365
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:54,729
Are you even sure you
can get that?

366
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:58,399
No. No, will he, will-will
he take it?

367
00:24:58,942 --> 00:25:02,153
All right. I can ask. Let me
call you back after I speak...

368
00:25:02,153 --> 00:25:03,279
to him. All right? [exhales]

369
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,157
[Garmen] Ameena, you can make
new friends. Better friends.

370
00:25:06,157 --> 00:25:07,492
All right? I promise.

371
00:25:07,492 --> 00:25:09,077
[Ameena] I don't want to make
new friends.

372
00:25:09,077 --> 00:25:10,954
I coming back just now.
[exhales]

373
00:25:10,954 --> 00:25:11,996
What happened? What is it?

374
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:14,123
Aked dead.

375
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:18,127
Oh Jesus Christ.

376
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:20,296
- [Ameena] Dad.
- I coming.

377
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:21,464
How you know?

378
00:25:21,464 --> 00:25:24,300
I don't know. Something to do
with Louis and Natalia.

379
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,426
They just call.

380
00:25:26,302 --> 00:25:28,763
- Ms. M. know?
- I don't think anybody know.

381
00:25:29,305 --> 00:25:30,515
Keep it that way.

382
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,643
And one other thing.

383
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:35,770
They ain't got the money.

384
00:25:37,063 --> 00:25:38,022
[scoffs]

385
00:25:38,356 --> 00:25:40,650
But they say they got a painting
worth five times the amount...

386
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,235
if you can still get them home.

387
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:44,320
[Ameena] My suitcase don't work.

388
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,281
Baby, I coming just now.
All right?

389
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:48,491
Uh, paint-painting. Yeah,
listen, I can't deal with...

390
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:49,450
this right now.

391
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,120
Just-Just, um, tell them we
call them later. All right?

392
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:54,998
And-And don't lose touch
with them.

393
00:25:54,998 --> 00:25:56,040
I won't.

394
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,251
[Police Officer #1] What's the
official time of death?

395
00:25:58,626 --> 00:26:00,753
[Police Officer #2] It's on the
95 tag.

396
00:26:00,753 --> 00:26:02,672
Any idea when the Crime
Scene arrives?

397
00:26:02,672 --> 00:26:04,007
[Police Officer #1] Man, we're
gonna be here all day.

398
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,227
Is he all right?

399
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:20,440
He's got a ricochet wound to the
rear of his right shoulder...

400
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,567
and there are bullet fragments
and shrapnel from...

401
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:23,568
the tile as well.

402
00:26:25,403 --> 00:26:27,071
You're welcome to come with us.

403
00:26:28,323 --> 00:26:29,282
I'm sorry?

404
00:26:29,615 --> 00:26:31,617
[Police Officer #3] We'll get
your statement at the hospital.

405
00:26:31,617 --> 00:26:33,161
This way you can stay
with your son.

406
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,371
Stay with...

407
00:26:37,957 --> 00:26:38,875
Right.

408
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:41,836
[ER Nurse] If I can just get a
little information from you.

409
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:47,091
I just called his mother. She'll
be here as soon as she can.

410
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:49,844
Oh, o-okay. All right.
Well, um, in the meantime...

411
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:52,764
if you wouldn't mind giving me
his date of birth, height...

412
00:26:52,764 --> 00:26:56,559
weight, vaccination history, any
allergies to penicillin...

413
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,518
or anything.

414
00:26:57,518 --> 00:27:00,980
Date of birth February 2007.

415
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:05,818
Okay, February 2007.
Do you know what day?

416
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:07,820
[clicks tongue]

417
00:27:09,364 --> 00:27:11,574
All right. Um, uh, what about
how tall he is.

418
00:27:11,574 --> 00:27:13,576
Do you know approximately
how tall he is?

419
00:27:13,576 --> 00:27:15,453
- Five-eight, five-nine.
- Okay.

420
00:27:15,453 --> 00:27:17,997
And approximately how much
do you think he weighs?

421
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:22,919
You know, we-we can wait for
his mom to get here for that.

422
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,171
Most importantly, any allergies
that you know of?

423
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:26,172
To penicillin?

424
00:27:26,172 --> 00:27:28,174
Or any other medications
that he's taking?

425
00:27:28,174 --> 00:27:29,258
I don't know.

426
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:36,057
[door opens]

427
00:27:38,976 --> 00:27:39,936
[door shuts]

428
00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:43,022
[keys drop on the table]

429
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:46,984
Mom?

430
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:49,737
Shit.

431
00:27:50,863 --> 00:27:52,907
- Where's Dad?
- [groans] Hospital.

432
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:56,828
His, uh, his chess guy. The one
that, um, he was playing...

433
00:27:56,828 --> 00:27:57,912
with in the park.

434
00:27:57,912 --> 00:28:00,456
He, uh, had a stroke
or something.

435
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:05,253
Classic Jeff worried there's
some total stranger out there...

436
00:28:05,253 --> 00:28:06,671
in the world that doesn't
love him.

437
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,381
Mom, have you been drinking?

438
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:15,012
Yes.

439
00:28:16,305 --> 00:28:18,599
But only for [chuckling]
49 years. [laughs]

440
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:25,731
Wow. Okay. Well, I can't deal
with this headfuck right now...

441
00:28:25,731 --> 00:28:30,820
so I'm gonna put it over here. Um...

442
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:34,532
Thanks, Mom. [scoffs]

443
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,952
[Kristin] How's Derek
by the way?

444
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:41,622
[exhales] [annoyed chuckles]
Derek.

445
00:28:41,622 --> 00:28:45,835
Well, Derek is in a hotel...

446
00:28:46,252 --> 00:28:49,338
because it turns out that
Charisse is not a place.

447
00:28:49,338 --> 00:28:52,175
No. Charisse is a person.

448
00:28:52,842 --> 00:28:55,303
So, yeah. Another
fucking secret.

449
00:28:56,471 --> 00:28:58,973
Oh, it's not a secret, Sam.

450
00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:03,895
Wait. You knew about Charisse?

451
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:08,024
Well, after Derek took
over the books for me...

452
00:29:08,024 --> 00:29:10,067
I used to double-check
for a while.

453
00:29:12,153 --> 00:29:14,906
What, because you didn't
trust him? W-What?

454
00:29:18,117 --> 00:29:22,788
Yeah, I noticed that he had
taken some money out...

455
00:29:23,623 --> 00:29:25,666
and then he put it back from a
different account.

456
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:27,084
It's very easy to trace.

457
00:29:28,127 --> 00:29:31,672
Wait and then... [chuckles] And
then you trusted him?

458
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:33,508
After that? [stammers]

459
00:29:34,217 --> 00:29:35,510
He paid it back.

460
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:39,305
Do you remember he never
wanted to live in New York?

461
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:41,974
But he did, for you.

462
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:47,104
He dug in and dedicated every
moment after that to you.

463
00:29:47,104 --> 00:29:51,692
And to the Chef Jeff of it all.
And-And to Jared.

464
00:29:56,739 --> 00:29:58,574
You're looking at me
like I'm crazy.

465
00:29:58,574 --> 00:29:59,492
[chuckling exhale]

466
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:00,368
Like Dad looks at me.

467
00:30:02,745 --> 00:30:04,789
- No, Dad's right. You're...
- Yeah, no, I know.

468
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:05,748
I know, it's his bit.

469
00:30:05,748 --> 00:30:07,750
I'm the ostrich not the eagle.

470
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:10,336
But he's wrong, Sam because
I see.

471
00:30:10,336 --> 00:30:11,379
Okay.

472
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:14,632
Well, if you're an eagle, you're
an eagle with her head in...

473
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:16,676
the sand which is fucking worse.

474
00:30:20,263 --> 00:30:22,640
You didn't tell me about my
own fucking husband.

475
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,310
[laughs] Because you would never
have forgiven him! Would you?

476
00:30:27,103 --> 00:30:28,813
And you would have lost him!

477
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:30,231
[haunting instrumental music plays]

478
00:30:38,781 --> 00:30:39,699
[Natalia] Louis!

479
00:30:53,796 --> 00:30:55,131
This from them.

480
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,426
From Saturday night.

481
00:31:00,845 --> 00:31:04,140
Ms. Mahabir say a circle is
gonna protect everybody.

482
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,185
You think that shit works?

483
00:31:11,564 --> 00:31:13,357
I don't know what's worse...

484
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:19,322
it works and it's all
broke up now...

485
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,451
or it never worked
in the first place.

486
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,167
[Harmony] Sam.

487
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:36,172
Inspector Harmony.
Uh, how can I help you? [scoffs]

488
00:31:36,172 --> 00:31:39,884
Oh, I would perhaps limit to the
scope of that question being...

489
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:43,179
that I have been suspended
starting noon tomorrow.

490
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:44,972
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

491
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:47,141
No, you're not. Uh...

492
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:49,935
[Sam slightly chuckles]

493
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:53,648
Your case, by the way, uh,
it's almost been solved.

494
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:56,567
At least they're about to make
a bunch of fancy arrests, so...

495
00:31:57,318 --> 00:31:59,695
And you came here
to tell me that?

496
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:02,448
Oh no, no. [chuckles]
The truth is...

497
00:32:02,448 --> 00:32:03,366
Well, you're fishing.

498
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:09,372
What do they call it when a fish
is fished and then it's on...

499
00:32:09,372 --> 00:32:11,040
the deck gasping?

500
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,085
Uh, flailing?

501
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:16,003
That would be me.

502
00:32:17,713 --> 00:32:19,256
[elevator door chimes]

503
00:32:19,757 --> 00:32:20,716
[Sam exhales]

504
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:23,761
Your Uncle Gene told
me everything.

505
00:32:24,845 --> 00:32:29,016
Oh. You mean the disgraced
former cop who shot himself...

506
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:31,519
in the foot to avoid prison and
get a lifetime of disability?

507
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:34,939
I think you're saying that just
to try to scare me. [scoffs]

508
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:37,274
Doesn't really matter anyway
because why would you say...

509
00:32:37,274 --> 00:32:38,943
anything to incriminate
yourself?

510
00:32:39,276 --> 00:32:41,654
Well, especially when it has no
material effect on...

511
00:32:41,654 --> 00:32:42,780
this investigation.

512
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,909
Or worse, possibly expose you
to all sorts of liability.

513
00:32:47,952 --> 00:32:50,579
Nah, if I were you,
I'd be like...

514
00:32:51,372 --> 00:32:54,333
"I worked hard for this life and
I'm gonna protect...

515
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,584
"the fuck out of it."

516
00:32:55,584 --> 00:32:58,462
- Why are you here?
- The Series A Investments.

517
00:32:58,462 --> 00:33:01,716
Who made them and through
which banks. We've hit a wall.

518
00:33:01,716 --> 00:33:02,925
I thought you were fired.

519
00:33:03,718 --> 00:33:06,387
It may help Roan Jessup find
other people from down there...

520
00:33:06,387 --> 00:33:08,723
who are now in other
cities in other states.

521
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:14,103
Well, I-I... [exhales] Wait, he
may help you to find a job?

522
00:33:15,438 --> 00:33:17,398
As I said, it's a Hail Mary.

523
00:33:18,524 --> 00:33:19,900
And the ball's up in the air.

524
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,238
I don't know where it's gonna
land or if it's gonna land.

525
00:33:25,614 --> 00:33:27,450
But you're right.

526
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:33,497
Because why would you fuck
all of this up for that?

527
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:38,461
You should probably get inside.
Where it's safe.

528
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:39,920
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

529
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:47,136
[security alarm on door beeps]

530
00:34:02,443 --> 00:34:04,528
[Harmony] So I'm looking for the
name of the person who...

531
00:34:04,528 --> 00:34:07,823
rented the chalk cart and the
address it was sent to.

532
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:10,075
Thank you.

533
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,412
Could you spell that for me?

534
00:34:14,747 --> 00:34:16,749
[Broward] All right. This is a
microphone and a camera.

535
00:34:16,749 --> 00:34:18,709
Whatever you see, we see.

536
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:20,294
You know what you're doing?

537
00:34:20,836 --> 00:34:25,716
Uh, [exhales] look at everyone,
uh, hold on them.

538
00:34:25,716 --> 00:34:26,842
And?

539
00:34:26,842 --> 00:34:28,427
[exhales] Say names whenever
I can.

540
00:34:28,427 --> 00:34:29,428
Yeah.

541
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:30,513
[Sanders] If...

542
00:34:30,888 --> 00:34:32,097
It's not weird.

543
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:35,351
Hey, Detective Sanders and I are
gonna be behind you...

544
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:36,435
the entire time.

545
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:40,898
And-And Agent Jessup is-is
ghosting you in a follow van.

546
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:44,276
Our eyes are gonna be on
you the entire time.

547
00:34:44,276 --> 00:34:45,569
[Fong] How are we looking?

548
00:34:45,569 --> 00:34:47,488
[Sanders] Mahabir is meeting at
20-hundred.

549
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:48,989
We're going in at 20:30.

550
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:53,410
Ah. Yeah. At first we thought
our error on the night of...

551
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:56,831
the event meant that our
rebirth would be impossible...

552
00:34:56,831 --> 00:35:00,292
but then Mr. Willoughby
explained what we thought...

553
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,544
were mistakes...

554
00:35:02,128 --> 00:35:07,216
were actually a series of
necessary turns...

555
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:11,178
that would expel the impurities
within our circle.

556
00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:16,225
So now we are ready to go ahead
with what we're meant to do.

557
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:18,477
Oh.

558
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,191
I haven't had the same feelings
of enthusiasm and hope...

559
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:29,488
since the day we exchanged
rings, Ranny.

560
00:35:30,656 --> 00:35:32,449
It's a new beginning.

561
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:38,581
I really think you'll be happy
with how this evening...

562
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:39,999
will turn out.
