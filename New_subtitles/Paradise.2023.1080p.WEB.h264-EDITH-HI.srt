347
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,541
[woman] You didn't tell him?

348
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
[Max] What?

349
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,250
Tell me what?

350
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,041
I put up something else
as collateral back then.

351
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm a match.

352
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,541
You... you put up your lifetime?

353
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,333
The bank advisor told me it was risk-free.

354
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,416
Worse comes to worst,
we could just sell the apartment.

355
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,416
I don't believe this. How can anyone...

356
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,250
And you never thought
to tell me about this before?

357
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,416
- I wanted the apartment for us.
- [Max sighs]

358
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,666
For our family.

359
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,833
No, we're gonna find a way to fix this.
It's... I'm also a match.

360
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,083
I already looked into that, Max.

361
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,125
According to Aeon,
there's no match for you in the database.

362
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,809
- But I've donated before.
- [woman] I know.

363
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,458
But apparently, that recipient
recently passed away.

364
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
[somber music playing]

365
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,208
Elena is the only one
who can still donate.

366
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Two and a half million. That's like...

367
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,333
forty...

368
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,500
forty years.

369
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,625
[tense music playing]

370
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,500
There has to be something we can do.

371
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,958
[woman] Unfortunately,
I don't see any other way.

372
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,458
[rain pattering]

373
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,541
[unsettling music playing]

374
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,041
[woman] Elena Toma?

375
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,892
- You're gonna need to come with us.
- She didn't do anything.

376
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:35,916
Sir, step back, please.

377
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,958
A writ of execution
has been issued against you.

378
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,791
We've reason to believe
that you're planning to leave the country.

379
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,291
We just went to see our lawyer.

380
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,958
Just a precautionary measure.

381
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,958
My colleague will escort you
to our vehicle.

382
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,625
[Max] What? Hey!

383
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,458
Elli?

384
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,666
We'll fix this, okay? We'll fix this.

385
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,916
I'll find a way.

386
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:00,873
[officer] Watch your head.

387
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,625
[unsettling music continues]

388
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,041
[Max] Ms. Theissen?

389
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,375
Uh. Remember? Max Toma?

390
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,750
Donation Manager of the Year.

391
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,250
Of course. How are you?

392
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,958
I need a loan. Two and a half million.

393
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,125
I know that's a lot of money,
but I can work it off.

394
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,916
The bank's trying to collect
40 years from my wife.

395
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,583
We've tried everything we could
to pay it off, but this,

396
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,666
it's just too much.

397
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,041
So your wife is having a donation
legally enforced on her.

398
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,205
Is that what you're saying?

399
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,250
Yes, 40 years.

400
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,750
To be honest, you're our last hope.

401
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,833
Send me your documentation.
I'll see what I can do for you. Okay?

402
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,916
[indistinct chattering]

403
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,750
[man] Our customers
need to feel 100% safe with us.

404
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,208
Otherwise, the whole business is at risk.

405
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,333
We've already taken countermeasures.

406
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,875
And as far as our business is concerned,

407
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:19,375
we sell a product worldwide
that's never been seen before,

408
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,708
and the quarterly profits
are reflecting that.

409
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,434
[woman] And you've invested
the entirety of those profits

410
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,666
into research
and other philanthropic projects.

411
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,416
We're talking about lost dividends
to the amount of 23 billion euros.

412
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,041
And that's just last year.

413
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,458
Research is what made this company
what it is today.

414
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,875
Yes, that may be true,
but we've now perfected the procedure.

415
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,083
"Perfected"?

416
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,625
How the hell can we say we perfected it

417
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,541
if donors and recipients
still need to be DNA compatible?

418
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,041
We're still wasting
way too many valuable resources

419
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,833
looking for suitable donors.

420
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,375
That some people will never find.

421
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,416
[pensive music playing]

422
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,041
A minority
with a rare genetic disposition.

423
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,375
I mean, can we really justify
spending this much

424
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:05,125
on questionable research
that only covers a tiny niche?

425
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,625
And one more thing...

426
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,458
The shareholders are worried that
because of this, Ms. Theissen,

427
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,958
you might be a bit too biased.

428
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,833
As opposed to you?

429
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:19,541
[pensive music continues]

430
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,250
[footsteps approaching]

431
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,333
You ready?

432
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,500
[Max] She promised.

433
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,916
Sophie Theissen promised
she'd get back to me.

434
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,208
[sighs] Max.

435
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:48,708
I've been trying to reach her office
every day for weeks. Every day.

436
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,750
Welcome to Aeon.

437
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,541
Luna Ackermann.
We're here to see a patient.

438
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,625
Elena Toma. I'm her lawyer.

439
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,458
Her donation is in two hours.

440
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,351
I can't let her see any visitors
until after the procedure.

441
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,726
Look, I work over at headquarters.
I just wanna see my wife.

442
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,208
For enforced donations, you have to wait
until after the operation.

443
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:33,333
You're sucking 40 years from her,
and I'm not even allowed to see her?

444
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,666
Regulations. I'm sorry.

445
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,375
"Regulations"? You asshole! Her life
will be over after you're done with her!

446
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,083
- I wanna see her now!
- Max.

447
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,708
This is getting us nowhere.

448
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:46,041
Luna, that's all I ever hear from you.
Why are you even here, huh?

449
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:47,833
Fuck!

Elena?

455
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,250
- [tense music playing]
- Elena!

456
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,000
Oh!

Elena! Elena!

459
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:19,791
Let go of me!

460
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:22,958
I just wanna see my wife! Let go of me!

461
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:26,000
You need to calm down right now...

462
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,000
[grunting]

463
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,416
...or else my colleague
is going to hurt you.

464
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,958
Hey, please! This isn't necessary.

465
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:36,541
The man just wanted to see his wife.
That's all. Please let him go.

466
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,708
He'll be calm.

[Sophie] <i>Why were we finally able
to stop the climate crisis?</i>

470
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:52,333
Because the top 5%
decided to invest into green technology.

471
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:56,833
<i>Because the prospect of presumably living
in this world for, hopefully, much longer,</i>

472

their perspective on the climate.</i>

[beeping]

00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:30,541
You, Ms. Elena Toma,
hereafter referred to as "the debtor,"

479
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:34,125
have had an attachment of assets
issued against you.

480
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:37,583
The seizure shall be levied
against the time assets of the debtor.

481
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:41,791
As decided by the court,
the amount shall be 38 years.

482

In accordance with section 863
of the Civil Procedure Code,

483

after the procedure
is performed by Aeon Inc.,

484
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:53,250
the seized amount shall be

<i>What do you have to say about that?</i>

488
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,291
It's innovation. You can't stop it.

489
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:06,750
Uh, but what you can do is
enforce the responsible handling

491

- Preexisting conditions?
- Not in his file, at least.

703
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:32,000
But his donation was only
three months ago.

704
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,625
It probably hasn't sunk in for him yet
that he isn't 30 anymore.

705
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:36,166
I'll take it from here.

706
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:39,541
- Theater 2 has just become available.
- You don't have to.

707
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:41,958
- Elli, you need to take it slow.
- [groans]

708
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:44,000
Your shift is almost over anyway.

709
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:45,583
Okay?

710
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:47,958
[whispers] Okay.

711
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,083
[Max] Elli.

712
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,166
Elli, we need to talk.

713
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,130
- Oh, Max.
- You have to come with me right now.

714
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,458
- Listen to me.
- What for?

715
00:45:58,541 --> 00:46:00,791
Let it go, please.

716
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:03,208
You have to accept the situation.

717
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:06,250
What if I've found a way?

00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:08,333
[pensive music playing]

719
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:12,458
Just trust me.

[mysterious music continues]

726
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:04,041
This is Sophie Theissen.

727
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:08,875
The woman who stole 40 years from you.
And now we're taking them back.

728
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,000
[male officer] I'll start here.

729
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:15,750
Are you gonna do that side?

730
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,208
- [Nowak] Thanks. I owe you one.
- [male officer] No worries.

731
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:29,958
They think it was Adam?

732
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:33,166
Well, that's pretty conclusive evidence.

733
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,250
And you? What do you think?

734
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:38,708
Usually, they just kill their targets.
Kidnapping is new.

735
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:40,833
What else they got?

736
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:43,375
According to traffic surveillance,

737
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:47,083
there was a car from Berlin Cars
at the cemetery, around the back.

738
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:50,291
Booked via a fake account
that can't be traced back to anyone.

739
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:54,583
However, that same account
has been used before at Tempelhof Field.

740
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,500
I went and checked our database.

741
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,458
And guess who just happened
to enter the field

742
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:01,291
at that exact time using an Aeon ID.

743
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:07,458
- Have his work phone traced.
- I think we can skip past that.

744
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:10,083
He's Employee of the Year.
He's not stupid.

745
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:13,666
But as long as you have a face,
you can't hide forever.

746
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,541
Well, you're not as stupid as you look.

747
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,541
Have you lost your damn mind?

748
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:25,375
[Max] It's the only way.

749
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:26,500
No!

750
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:28,291
This is crazy.

751
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:31,916
I've got everything set,
but we need to get out of Germany now.

752
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:36,291
I packed you some clothes.
You'll have to leave your phone here too.

753
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,750
I'm not doing this. Absolutely not.

754
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,125
Well, then what? Huh?

755
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:44,208
We just live like this?

756
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:48,916
You run yourself down as a doctor
for a few more years until you drop dead?

[somber music playing]

758
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:58,250
What are you going to do
after the operation?

759
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:02,333
Kill Theissen and run?

760
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:04,666
We'll start over.

761
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:07,791
Away from here, by the ocean.

762
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,291
Max, we aren't kids anymore.

763
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:13,375
If they catch us,
it's not just my life that'll be over.

764
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:15,708
Yours would be too.

765
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,416
Yeah.

[pensive music playing]

767
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,958
[Max] I guess you shouldn't have
blown me off, huh?

768
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:51,125
You're right.
Our lives are over either way.

769
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:57,250
So, should I go to prison for this woman,
or are you coming with me?

770
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,916
[tense music playing]

771
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:16,166
Should we inform the local authorities?

772
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:18,166
What for?

773
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:44,250

[man 3] Gonna check on the gallery.

779
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:05,750
- All clear!
- [man 4] Okay. Moving down.

780
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:09,541
Back to position one.

781
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,375
We'll find them.

782
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:14,791
You can save it with the platitudes.
I've been at this longer than you.

You still surprise me sometimes.

[Max chuckles]

788
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:49,333
I surprise myself.

789
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:57,208

799
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:51,041
Do you know the story
of how Max Toma met his wife?

800
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:55,083
He was assigned to her
as a donation manager.

801
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:56,666
But in the course of making the sale,

802
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,458
they fell head over heels in love
and got married.

803
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:01,125
Hmm. How romantic.

804
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:02,458
Yeah.

Until their apartment suddenly burns down,
and they're drowning in debt.

I know we're not dealing
with criminal masterminds here.

These are two people
in a desperate situation.

Well, if you were Elena Toma,
how do you think you'd feel?

00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:17,625
If your life was stolen from you
and given to some billionaire

810

because you forgot to blow out a candle.

811
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:22,250

"Your time. Your chance. Your choice."

They wouldn't be the first
to fall for something like that.

815
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:32,375
That suddenly gives them the right
to kidnap someone?

What about you?

827
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:14,708
I started working as a bodyguard
for Sophie Theissen over 30 years ago.

828
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:16,916
I owe her a lot.

829
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:24,041
Apparently, a lot more
than first impressions would imply.

830
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:27,750
Chronologically, I'm 64.

831
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:31,041
Sophie Theissen needs people
she can trust implicitly.

832
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:34,375
And I guess the rejuvenation treatment
is just an added perk.

you can stop quietly sulking

00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:24,458
Is that for us?

872
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:26,458
Shit, I don't know.

873
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:28,916
Who else would it be for?

874
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:32,833
We still have the passports.

875
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:36,125
Those won't help us
if they check too closely.

876
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,208
So, this is it, then?

877
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:42,291

Um, uh, a bathtub from Germany.

892
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,401

What's inside?

920
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,291
Bathtub, I think.

921
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,250
You think?

922
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:20,458
Tell him you're just the driver.

923
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:23,541
I... I'm just a driver.

924
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:28,916
[officer on phone] <i>Sir, I'm gonna need you
to open the whole box.</i>

Sir, did you hear me?

01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:39,125
Everything okay here?

927
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:41,291
He looks a little nervous.

928
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:44,875
Why are you so nervous?

[baby crying]

930
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:49,333
All right, have a good trip.

931
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:51,166
- Hey.
- [car engine starts]

932
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:53,416
Just take a deep breath.

933
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:56,541
<i>Just smile and tell them
you're not used to this.</i>

934
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,125
I'm just not used to this.

935
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:00,708
Not used to what?

936
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:04,166
Being threatened by a gun.

937
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,083
[tense music playing]

938
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,291
How many times have I told you?

939
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:14,791
Stop pointing that thing at people
for no reason.

940
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:18,356
We're sorry, sir. You're good to go.

941
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:20,666
Okay.

It's all right, Emilia.
Everything'll be okay.

946
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:47,708
Can we go now?

947
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:49,666
Your phones.

948
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:51,750
Phones!

- [baby crying]
- [mother shushing]

950
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:55,541
I'll just get the phone, okay?
It's all right.

01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:57,666
- [baby crying]
- [mother shushing]

952
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:08,875
I'm sorry.

[ethereal music playing]

957
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:54,000
We had no choice.

958
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:58,583
Yeah.

959
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,250
[phone chimes]

960
01:03:09,791 --> 01:03:11,000
We crossed the border.

961
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,291
We should check on her.
She's not doing well.

962
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:22,500
We can't stop now.
They'll call the police.

963
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:24,833
We need to take side roads.

964
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:27,458
And then?

965
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:30,000
Wait for the doctor to contact us.

966
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:45,625
[music fades]

967
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:53,625
What do you want from me?

968
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:57,750
We're just gonna take back what's ours.
Then we'll let you go.

969
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,625
You can have whatever you want.
My mother will pay it.

970
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:02,000
Your mother?

971
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:03,916
Sophie Theissen.

972
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:06,500
You are Sophie Theissen.

973
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:10,000
What? I'm...
I'm Marie Theissen, her daughter.

974
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:14,583
[chuckles] No.

975
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:16,333
She's lying.

976
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:20,583
My mother keeps me out of the public eye
for reasons just like this.

977
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:25,375
SOPHIE THEISSEN DAUGHTER

978
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:26,791
[Max] Daughter. See?

979
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:29,500
This is Theissen's daughter.

980
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:31,708
She died of progeria over ten years ago.

981
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:33,708
That was my older sister Lucy.

982
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:38,250
Listen, my mother and I
have always looked alike.

983
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,059
- But after this fucking donation...
- Shut up!

984
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:43,250
Did she have any ID on her?
Driver's license, anything?

985
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:44,916
Yes, only it's in my purse.

986
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,791
That was left at the cemetery,
and she knows that.

987
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:53,083
- Nice performance you put on though.
- No. No. Please. Please!

988
01:04:53,166 --> 01:04:56,126
My mother will give you anything!
Honest to god. She'll give you... Please!

989
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:57,833
- [Marie whimpers]
- [taser crackling]

990
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:15,250
We gotta make sure it's her.

991
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:17,708
[breathing heavily]

992
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:20,708
How?

993
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:25,166
Call Aeon to find out
if we've actually got the right one?

994
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:27,125
So her people can track us down?

995
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:28,958
That's exactly what she wants us to do!

996
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:31,125
Theissen would say anything
to save herself!

997
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,375
We're sticking to the plan.

998
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:35,791
What is the plan?

999
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,125
Why hasn't this Dr. Berg contacted us?

1000
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:43,458
What if it's a scam,
and they just wanted the money?

1001
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:45,708
How long are you going
to keep her in there?

1002
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,541
She's dehydrated and hypothermic.

1003
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,916
We need to find a warm place to hide.

1004
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:54,875
[keys jingling]

1005
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:58,583
[ethereal music playing]

1006
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,083
[Elena] Why isn't anyone here?

1007
01:06:26,166 --> 01:06:27,791
The tourism industry collapsed

1008
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:30,208
when the Baltic States
left the European Union.

1009
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:34,083
We've got the hotel to ourselves.

1010
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:37,916
Theissen's used to it.

1011
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:47,416
[Elena] Ha ha.

1012
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:57,250
Well, it sure beats that hotel
you booked us that time in Tuscany.

1013
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:58,708
[Max] Ha ha.

1014
01:06:58,791 --> 01:07:00,375
[chuckles softly]

1015
01:07:08,416 --> 01:07:09,666
It really hurts.

1016
01:07:13,458 --> 01:07:15,000
[footsteps approaching]

1017
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:16,166
Thanks.

1018
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,140
- Watch what you're doing.
- We don't have to be assholes about it.

1019
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:27,083
You're the one who sold 40 years
to my mother, aren't you?

1020
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:28,625
[sighs] Quit playing.

1021
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:30,791
You know better than anybody
that it was enforced.

1022
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,083
Don't let her get to you.

1023
01:07:33,166 --> 01:07:35,666
I'm against donations, too, you know.

1024
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,875
What happened to you
happens to so many people.

1025
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:43,958
Look at the refugees that go missing
from the camps outside the EU borders.

1026
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:47,416
Even children!
They're sold by their own parents.

1027
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,625
Not to Aeon
but to illegal Eastern Bloc clinics

1028
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:54,875
so that third-rate celebs and influencers
can rejuvenate on the cheap.

1029
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:56,958
Are you trying to make me feel guilty?

1030
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:59,833
- You of all people?
- No.

1031
01:07:59,916 --> 01:08:03,458
I'm trying to tell you
that I'm on the same side as you.

1032
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:05,901
I've been trying to convince my mother
that what she does...

1033
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:06,958
Bullshit!

1034
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:11,583
Please. You've got to believe me.
Please don't.

1035
01:08:11,666 --> 01:08:14,041
I won't say another word. I promise.

1036
01:08:17,083 --> 01:08:18,375
Hey! Hey!

1037
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:21,125
Whose side are you on here, huh?

1038
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:22,291
Whose side?

1039
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:23,708
Yes! I'm doing this for you.

1040
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:24,791
For you!

1041
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:29,375
We don't even know
if you kidnapped the right woman.

1042
01:08:29,458 --> 01:08:30,458
[sighs]

1043
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,541
Even if it is her daughter,

1044
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:37,583
then she's probably compatible with you.

1045
01:08:37,666 --> 01:08:40,541
First-degree blood relatives
are almost always a match.

1046
01:08:40,625 --> 01:08:41,875
We can still use her.

1047
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
"Use her"?

1048
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,166
Uh, she can just get it back after
from her mother.

1049
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:51,000
They can sort it out themselves.
It's not our problem.

1050
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:55,833
The consequences of what we're doing here
are absolutely our problem.

1051
01:08:55,916 --> 01:08:58,875
Oh, okay. So we let her go.
I mean, it's just your life.

1052
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:00,916
She still has hers.
Maybe she wants a child.

1060
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:38,416
Is there any running water here?

1061
01:09:40,416 --> 01:09:41,875
I'd like to clean myself up.

1062
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,500
Please.

Wait a sec.

- [restraint snaps]
- [Marie] Thanks.

1067
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:11,875
My mom just wanted to help Lucy.
That's how the whole thing started.

1068
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:16,958
She was researching cell aging
and made groundbreaking discoveries.

1069
01:10:17,916 --> 01:10:21,250
But she couldn't find
a match for Lucy in time.

Help me!

What happened with Theissen?

1119

She said she wanted to clean herself up,
and I didn't wanna be an asshole.

1120
01:14:52,666 --> 01:14:53,708
Of course not.

1121
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,666
Are you angry with me?

1122
01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:00,000
No. Why? Should I be?

1123
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:04,000
[sighs] After everything
I've done for you?

1124
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:08,500
For me? What about what I need?
Are you interested in that?

1125
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:13,458
Yeah, right.

1126
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:16,750
I'm not doing this for you,
for us, or our child.

I really don't know what you want from me.

The skin regenerates

Elli, she... she's manipulating both of us
by acting all innocent.

1133

You know what went through my mind
when I saw her going under?

01:15:50,666 --> 01:15:52,833
If she dies, then it was all for nothing.

1135

She's my only chance.

1136

That's at the border of Belarus,

I'm getting Marie out of there alive.
I don't care how.

1181
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:19,083
So we'll be digging
a couple of graves today.

You think I would do that?

I'm wondering if I could do it.

1185
01:19:28,291 --> 01:19:30,625
Whether I could live with those ghosts.

1186
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,375
It isn't easy.

It may sound tempting,

but youth alone doesn't
make your life better or happier.

1192
01:19:59,708 --> 01:20:00,875
Just longer.

When you've worked
in the private sector for so long,

you sometimes forget why you started.

1196
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:13,708
I know a trick.

1197
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:16,541
It's called anchor.

1198

Any time I start to doubt, I do this.

1199
01:20:23,916 --> 01:20:26,500
It reminds me

- I know.

But I'm afraid
this is much bigger than you.

My wife was forced to make a donation.
We're the victims here.

1220

I know your story, Max.

your house burns down.

Just when Sophie Theissen
urgently needs a donation.

1226
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:58,375
And your own recipient, Max,

1227
01:21:58,458 --> 01:22:00,625
just happens to die
in a motorcycle accident

1228
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,166
so that only Elena remains as a donor.

1229
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:08,125
So many tragic coincidences.

1230
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:09,875
What?

1231
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:11,833
W... what are you saying?

1232
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:14,916
You were supposed to be
Elena's donation manager.

1233
01:22:15,791 --> 01:22:17,333
Isn't that how you two met?

1234
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:20,708
[Marie whimpers]

1235
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:24,916
Sophie Theissen already knew back then
that Elena was a possible donor.

1236
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,375
The only match she'd ever really found.

1237
01:22:28,291 --> 01:22:30,625
You were supposed to convince Elena.

1238
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:32,708
Instead, you married her.

1239
01:22:32,791 --> 01:22:34,541
[Marie whimpers]

1240
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:36,625
[Lilith] Too bad for Sophie Theissen.

1241
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:40,000
How is she gonna get access
to Elena's lifetime now?

1242
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,000
[Marie whimpers]

1243
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:47,541
The apartment that was much too expensive
for the two of you?

1244
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:50,166
The bank that nevertheless
gave you the loan?

1245
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:53,166
But only if Elena
put up her lifetime as a collateral.

1246
01:22:54,875 --> 01:22:56,416
Then a little fire,

1247
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,625
and the two of you are so deeply plunged
into financial misery

1248
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:02,208
that she could simply take your lifetime.

1249
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:06,875
And now the two of you
wanna do exactly the same with this girl,

1250
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:10,083
the only Theissen
with a bit of a conscience.

1251
01:23:10,166 --> 01:23:12,366
It was a mistake.
I didn't know we had the wrong person.

1252
01:23:12,416 --> 01:23:15,666
Really? After spending two days with her?

1253
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,500
Or you just didn't wanna see it?

1254
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:21,791
You are no better.

1255
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:25,166
You're killing innocent people.

1256
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:27,375
"Innocent"?

1257
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:34,625
- [Marie whimpers]
- Hey. Hey! Hey!

1258
01:23:37,791 --> 01:23:38,958
[Elena grunts]

1259
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:44,833
[tense music playing]

1260
01:23:49,916 --> 01:23:52,500
Finish what you started. Kill her.

1261
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:54,083
Wha... what?

1262
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,166
What?

1263
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:01,583
You were prepared to take
40 years of her life.

1264
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:05,583
Obviously you decided some time ago
that your life is worth more than hers.

1265
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,166
That's just sick. I won't do it.

1266
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:10,166
Stop. This is madness.

1267
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,375
[whimpering] I've never done anything.

1268
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:17,583
Exactly. What did you ever really do
to stop your mother?

1269
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:22,666
There's only one bullet,
so no funny business.

1270
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:24,708
[gasping, whimpering]

1271
01:24:24,791 --> 01:24:27,041
- [guns cocking]
- [Lilith] Your life or hers.

1272
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:28,458
Make your choice!

1273
01:24:34,583 --> 01:24:36,583
[tense music intensifies]

1274
01:24:45,666 --> 01:24:48,583
[whimpering] Please! Please! Please don't!

1275
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:50,000
Please. Please.

1276
01:24:54,291 --> 01:24:56,000
[Marie whimpering]

1277
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
[Marie groans]

1278
01:25:00,833 --> 01:25:01,666
[gasps]

1279
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,708
[tense music subsides]

1280
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:09,666
[Marie gasps, whimpers]

1281
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:14,000
Most people become pacifists

1282
01:25:14,083 --> 01:25:16,375
when forced
to pull the trigger themselves.

1283
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:20,041
But if it's doctors in white coats
arranging it for you,

1284
01:25:20,125 --> 01:25:21,958
few have a problem with it.

1285
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:23,458
[phone buzzing]

1286
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:27,333
[Lilith] That's why Aeon is so successful
and so dangerous.

1287
01:25:27,416 --> 01:25:28,541
What?

1288
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:34,416
[man] Dr. Berg has shared
the location of his clinic.

1289
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:39,791
Valid for six hours.

1290
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:42,708
You're gonna miss that appointment,
I'm afraid.

1291
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:47,000
[man] Sophie Theissen
will be making an appearance soon,

1292
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:48,958
and she'll wanna talk to you.

1293
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:53,958
Our source is telling us
make sure she comes in with you alone,

1294
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:55,291
without her guard dogs.

1295
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:56,375
Is that clear?

1296
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:04,583
We're just the bait.
You wanna kill Sophie Theissen.

1297
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,125
And make a martyr of her?

1298
01:26:08,208 --> 01:26:10,833
No. We'll take her with us,

1299
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:12,791
provided you don't make a mistake.

1300
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:16,958
[vehicles approaching]

1301
01:26:38,916 --> 01:26:41,083
- [tense music playing]
- [guns cocking]

1302
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:47,958
Come on.

1303
01:26:49,208 --> 01:26:50,708
[guns cocking]

1304
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:56,333
You've got this.

1305
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:04,625
[door hinge squeaking]

1306
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:11,166
[man] Get down!

1307
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:14,625
On the ground now!

1308
01:27:15,333 --> 01:27:17,375
[Max] Marie Theissen is alive.

1309
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:20,750
If nothing happens to me,
nothing will happen to her.

1310
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:22,458
[man] Down on the ground!

1311
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:25,500
I wanna talk to Sophie Theissen.

1312
01:27:26,416 --> 01:27:27,500
Nobody else.

1313
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:30,416
Sophie Theissen.

1314
01:27:31,083 --> 01:27:32,375
If he fucks it up?

1315
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:34,916
Plan B.

1316
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:38,666
Sophie Theissen leaves either with us
or not at all.

1317
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:41,958
Judas will take care of that.

1318
01:27:51,416 --> 01:27:54,541
[unsettling music playing]

1319
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,041
My wife's youth suits you.

1320
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Mr. Toma,

1321
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:23,291
I understand that you feel

1322
01:28:23,375 --> 01:28:25,708
that what happened with your wife
was an injustice.

1323
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:26,958
From your point of view,

1324
01:28:27,041 --> 01:28:29,333
I can absolutely see
why you did what you did.

1325
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,500
My daughter is innocent.

1326
01:28:32,291 --> 01:28:33,791
More than anyone else in this.

1327
01:28:34,458 --> 01:28:36,833
I assume you don't want
to hurt innocent people?

1328
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,041
Only if I'm forced to.

1329
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:40,125
[Sophie] Good.

1330
01:28:41,083 --> 01:28:43,958
I'm prepared to pay you
for your wife's years a second time.

1331
01:28:44,958 --> 01:28:45,875
Ten million.

1332
01:28:45,958 --> 01:28:48,666
That's more than anyone in your position
could hope for.

1333
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:51,500
You can start a new life with that.

1334
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:54,750
And maybe you'll even find her
a new donor.

1335
01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:55,833
I have one.

1336
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:01,125
I'm Donation Manager of the Year.

1337
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:07,375
[gun cocks]

1338
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:10,041
I know how those conversations go.

1339
01:29:11,125 --> 01:29:14,750
How you list all the advantages
of donating like it's a big win for them.

1340
01:29:16,041 --> 01:29:18,500
All the while knowing
you have the upper hand.

1341
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:21,750
That you're holding all the aces.

1342
01:29:24,041 --> 01:29:26,375
And those poor suckers
sitting across from you...

1343
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:29,708
only had their lives.

1344
01:29:33,375 --> 01:29:36,250
We have your daughter,
and you have my wife's 40 years.

1345
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:40,041
If you give those back,
then we don't need Marie anymore.

1346
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:41,666
If you don't,

1347
01:29:42,666 --> 01:29:44,875
then we'll have no other choice.
Your call.

1348
01:29:47,333 --> 01:29:49,833
How do I know that Marie's still alive?
That she's well?

1349
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:52,583
She's not doing well.

1350
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:54,958
But she's still alive.

1351
01:29:55,916 --> 01:29:57,708
You can go see for yourself.

1352
01:29:58,625 --> 01:29:59,625
In person.

1353
01:30:00,458 --> 01:30:03,125
Sophie Theissen is not
entering the building without me.

1354
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:08,416
The very minute any other person
goes through that door,

1355
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:11,333
my wife pulls the trigger.

1356
01:30:11,416 --> 01:30:13,458
Then we'll call Marie on the phone
from out here.

1357
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:15,791
Forget it, guys.

1358
01:30:17,166 --> 01:30:18,875
I know who I'm dealing with here.

1359
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,458
People who will do anything,

1360
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:24,416
burn down houses, arrange accidents.

1361
01:30:25,333 --> 01:30:27,541
This deal is going to go down
exactly the way I say.

1362
01:30:38,583 --> 01:30:39,708
All right, I'll come in.

1363
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:43,125
Good.

1364
01:30:44,166 --> 01:30:45,708
I will not lose Marie as well.

1365
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:49,666
[Kaya] Just one question, Mr. Toma.

1366
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,041
You wanted to talk
to Sophie Theissen directly.

1367
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:55,041
How did you know
she was going to be here in person?

1368
01:30:58,541 --> 01:31:02,000
[whispers] Say something.
You idiot, just say something.

1369
01:31:04,958 --> 01:31:06,083
It's a trap, Sophie!

1370
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:08,125
Fuck!

1371
01:31:09,208 --> 01:31:10,625
[tense music playing]

1372
01:31:15,541 --> 01:31:16,541
[whispers] Do it.

01:31:21,458 --> 01:31:23,291
- [gunshots]
- [Nowak grunts]

1374

[Nowak grunts]

1376
01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:33,083
Sophie!

1377
01:31:33,958 --> 01:31:35,500
Make sure she's dead.

1378
01:31:35,583 --> 01:31:37,083
- Fire!
- [guns cocking]

1379
01:31:38,916 --> 01:31:40,000
[Kaya] Fire!

1380
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:42,083
Fire!

1381
01:31:43,291 --> 01:31:45,291
[tense music playing]

1382
01:31:47,916 --> 01:31:50,375
- [gunshots continue]
- [breathing heavily]

01:31:58,791 --> 01:31:59,833
[groans]

1385
01:32:00,791 --> 01:32:02,791
- [breathing heavily]
- [gunshots continue]

1386
01:32:04,625 --> 01:32:05,625
Elena.

1387
01:32:11,458 --> 01:32:12,708
[Max grunting, groaning]

1388
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:16,833
- [man 1] Get down! Get down!
- [man 2] Come on! Come over this way!

1389
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:19,916
[indistinct shouting]

1390
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:23,875
[Lilith] Max, do you...

1391
01:32:25,083 --> 01:32:27,083
[indistinct shouting]

1392
01:32:35,166 --> 01:32:38,250
[indistinct shouting]

1393

- [Max coughing]
- [high-pitched ringing]

1394

[muffled groaning, coughing]

1395
01:32:56,458 --> 01:32:57,541
[man] I'm behind you.

1396
01:32:58,333 --> 01:32:59,416
I've got you covered.

1397
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:01,583
[Max grunting]

1398
01:33:03,541 --> 01:33:04,541

You said she's also compatible.

1474

She can get it back from her mother.

Her mother is dead.

Theissen took it from us.

1485

Theissen burned down our home,

1486
01:38:45,416 --> 01:38:47,125
had your recipient killed.

1487
01:38:47,666 --> 01:38:48,958
We need to go public with that.

1488

Will it?

01:38:55,208 --> 01:38:58,708
There's gotta be another way
to fix this, Elena. It's just not right.
