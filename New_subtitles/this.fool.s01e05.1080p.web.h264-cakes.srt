1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,654
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Wake your ass up.

2
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,281
I'm leading group hug this week.

3
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,200
Come on, hurry up. We're gonna be late.

4
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:16,975
Alright. Damn!

5
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,707
Hey, dawg, you finished
your GED homework?

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,083
Nah.

7
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,211
- What you mean nah?
- You gotta stay on top of that shit.

8
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,528
I don't wanna write you up.

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,464
Come on, you never write me up.

10
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,907
Hey, bitch, I'm in charge now.

11
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,534
Don't test me.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,580
Fuckin' idiot.

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,977
Hey, come on, we're gonna be late.

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,021
Why you playin' around and fighting, huh?

15
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,380
Let go! Let go!

16
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,439
Back in the days, it was more innocent.

17
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,694
Just me at the computer, public library,

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,114
waiting 20 minutes
for a damn titty to load.

19
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,409
But now,

20
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,161
my porn addiction is outta control.

21
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,725
I even jacked off
in the computer lab here,

22
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,751
which I'm truly ashamed of.

23
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,189
Bro, what have I become?

24
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,692
Damn.

25
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,301
This fool's horny!

26
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,513
Luis, shut up.

27
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,766
Randy, please continue.

28
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,913
Basically, every time I try to have sex,

29
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,355
my dick is like wet spaghetti.

30
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,443
I'd rather watch porn
than have sex with my own wife.

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,423
Now, she even
thinking about leaving me.

32
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,883
It's okay.

33
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,886
Hey, hey, Randy, you know,
that's real sad and all,

34
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,162
and no disrespect, homey, but...

35
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,081
does porn make you randy, baby?

36
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,561
Nah, nah, nah, wait, wait.

37
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,879
Does porn make you randy, Randy?

38
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,758
You get it? Austin Powers!

39
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,445
- You know what?
- Let's wrap it up there.

40
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,030
Come on, everybody. Let's bring it in.

41
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,615
Let's get a group hug going.

42
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,866
Hey, no, I'm not,
I'm not huggin' this fool.

43
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,409
He probably has a boner right now.

44
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,393
Nah, I'm just playin',
he can't even keep it hard.

45
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,647
- Okay, come on. Just ignore him.
- He's an idiot.

46
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,151
I'll handle it, Randy.

47
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,737
Luis, hold up.

48
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,533
You gotta start
taking this shit seriously.

49
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,054
This shit is corny,
especially with you in charge.

50
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,597
You know what they say:

51
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,373
Laughter's the best Tylenol.

52
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,768
Don't you mean best medicine?

53
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,394
Is Tylenol medicine?

54
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,963
- Yeah.
- Well, then I think I got it right.

55
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,050
Dawg, you're the only one laughing
at your dumb-ass jokes.

56
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,261
Austin Powers is an old-ass movie.

57
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,697
You gotta update your references, playboy.

58
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,784
Hey, pendejo, Austin Powers is timeless.

59
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,452
All you do is quote movies.

60
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,853
That's what unfunny people do.

61
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,647
Fuck you.

62
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,543
- I'm fuckin' funny.
- No, you're not.

63
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:12,985
And you've never been funny.

64
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,862
And you never will be.

65
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,243
We'll see about that.

66
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,834
So I'm thinking about
getting my face tattoos removed.

67
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,131
But it's a tough decision because...

68
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,468
I don't know who I am without my tattoos.

69
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,097
I'm scared I'd be
killing a part of myself.

70
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,142
Does that make you randy, Candi?

71
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,330
Dawg, what the fuck?

72
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,375
I said, does that make you randy, Candi?

73
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,443
I know it makes you randy, Randy.

74
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,426
Why aren't you fools laughin'?

75
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,011
I'm just trying to make group hug

76
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,369
more groovy, baby.

77
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,765
Why the fuck are you quoting Austin Powers

78
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,876
while wearing a fuckin' dinosaur costume?

79
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,730
Do I have to explain
everything to you fools?

80
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,064
Look, it's simple, alright?

81
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,484
I wanted to make you fools laugh,
so I went to Party City.

82
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,068
I asked him if he had
any Austin Powers costumes.

83
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,653
I couldn't find any,
I said, "Do you have any in the back?"

84
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,572
He said, "No."
I said, "What else you got?"

85
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,157
He goes, "I got dinosaur costumes."

86
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,658
And I said, "That's perfect!"

87
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,536
'Cause comedy's all about
the element of surprise.

88
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,830
And that fool got the joke
and he was nice as fuck.

89
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,332
And he gave me a discount.

90
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:33,791
Cut the shit, dawg.

91
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,210
Nobody thinks you're funny.

92
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,461
Yes, they do. Stop hating!

93
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:40,006
Hey, my G. You got
some serious psychological issues.

94
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,449
Yeah, this ain't it, Luis.

95
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,785
Sit your ass down!

96
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,554
Alright then, whatever.

97
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,455
You fools don't like comedy,
then fuck it.

98
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,874
Somebody help him, please.

99
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,272
You're always disrupting the group
with your bullshit.

100
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,526
And you know what?
Everybody here is tired of it.

101
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,801
We're all here for you, dawg.

102
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,572
But I personally think you need
a trained mental health professional.

103
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,157
Whatever you got going on,

104
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,451
we can't even begin to address here.

105
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,018
You should go see Sandy.

106
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,038
Oh, yeah!

107
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,439
He definitely needs to go see Sandy.

108
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,042
Who the fuck is Sandy?

109
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,502
She's our volunteer psychologist.

110
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,902
And you know what? She's great.

111
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,197
And you could really benefit from therapy.

112
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,676
- You know what?
- Fuck it then.

113
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,970
I'll go to therapy right now
if it gets you fools off my back.

114
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,122
Maybe Sandy could tell me why none of you
have a sense of humor anymore.

115
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,838
Sorry, everyone.

116
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,900
Nobody here appreciates how funny I am.

117
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,819
These fools have no sense of humor.

118
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,512
You know, I bet some of them
don't even think a fart is funny.

119
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,450
Why do you feel the need
to be funny all the time?

120
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,019
- I don't know.
- I've always been funny since I was a kid.

121
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,455
You know, I have the gift of humor.

122
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,291
You know, my father was funny
and so am I.

123
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,959
You know, it's DNA and shit.

124
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,795
So your father encouraged
your sense of humor?

125
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,880
Oh, yeah, yeah.

126
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,864
We used to watch funny shit
all the time together.

127
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:08,344
We'd watch Cantinflas, Anchorman, Friday.

128
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,638
But most importantly,
we'd watch Austin Powers.

129
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,331
That shit had us rollin'.

130
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,977
It's nice to have that connection
with your father.

131
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,146
Yeah, yeah. Well, I did, you know,
before he passed away.

132
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,940
But now I like to think that fool's up
in heaven shaggin'.

133
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,317
Yeah, baby.

134
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,443
I see.

135
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,446
Do you think your having
to be funny all the time

136
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,806
has anything to do with filling the void
your father left?

137
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,320
Oh, fuck.

138
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,245
I got my fuckin' dino costume all wet.

139
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,497
Can't return this shit.

140
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,958
It's okay, Luis.

141
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,943
Yeah, so Sandy says
I've been hiding my trauma with humor.

142
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,153
You know, that I need to look
the trauma in the eye and be like,

143
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,781
"Hey, what's up, trauma?
I need you to chill the fuck out."

144
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,449
Hey, I told you she was good, huh?

145
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,535
What the fuck? I've been trying
to get everyone in this family

146
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,161
to go to therapy for years.

147
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,479
Damn, Ana, not everything
is about you, greedy.

148
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,124
All I know is I feel way better.

149
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,794
Like I feel lighter,
like I lost ten to fifteen pounds.

150
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:23,920
Probably gonna lose another five

151
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,130
when I go take this
big-ass masa right now.

152
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,239
Nasty.

153
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,910
Hey, Julio,
I notice you don't finish your crust.

154
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,932
You think that's because of something
fucked up from your childhood?

155
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,185
Hey, Dr. Phil,
you only had one therapy session.

156
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,395
Chill out, alright?

157
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,896
- I don't know.
- Maybe Luis is onto something.

158
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,274
I mean, it's pretty fucked up
that you don't eat the crusts.

159
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,651
- I just don't like the taste.
- It's not deeper than that.

160
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,487
Well, I don't know,
Sandy says everything is interconnected.

161
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,364
You know, and I had said to Sandy
that I used to clown you

162
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:55,100
and Sandy said that since I had
so much power over you as a kid,

163
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,912
- that it probably messed you up.
- Oh.

164
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,081
- At least that's what Sandy says.
- Makes sense.

165
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,333
So you've been talking
to Sandy about me?

166
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,157
Yeah, I talk to Sandy
about a lot of things.

167
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,695
But, yeah, you know,
you were in there a little.

168
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,840
Ohh!

169
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,551
I probably beat your ass one time
while you were eating pizza.

170
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,856
Damn, I just helped you
with a psychological breakthrough.

171
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,871
I can't wait to say that to Sandy.

172
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:17,932
Could I have your crusts?

173
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,268
Luis never beat my ass
while I was eating pizza

174
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,502
so I can still eat them.

175
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,172
Hey! Look at me.

176
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,174
You okay?

177
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,241
Julio.

178
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,910
What a surprise.

179
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,495
Are you here for a therapy session?

180
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,705
Oh, no, no, no. I don't need therapy.

181
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,208
I'm just here to check on
how my cousin Luis is doing.

182
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,335
Well, you know, I can't tell you much.

183
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,945
I mean, doctor-patient confidentiality.

184
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,948
But I can tell you that he's doing great.

185
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:52,866
Oh. Okay.

186
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,286
Just let me know if he's not
taking this shit seriously.

187
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,747
I don't mind checkin' his ass.

188
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,559
Thank you, but I don't think
that'll be necessary.

189
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,186
Are you sure?

190
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,796
I got no problem
putting that fool in check.

191
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,510
What exactly do you mean by checking?

192
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,430
You know, like checking his ass.

193
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,851
You mean, um, writing him up?

194
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:23,665
Yeah, I mean, actually I've never
written him up before, but I could.

195
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,583
- Hmm.
- But if I were to write that fool up

196
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,335
for all the shit
that he's done around here,

197
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,479
he would have been kicked out
of this program already.

198
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,465
That's why I check his ass instead.

199
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,883
I see.

200
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,927
He's lucky he has me to put him in check.

201
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,578
Not that he appreciates it.

202
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,722
You feel he doesn't appreciate you?

203
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,807
Not at all.

204
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,393
Just the other day, he tripped me
on the way out of the house.

205
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,520
I didn't know you lived together.

206
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,462
Yeah. He's crashing at my place.

207
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,924
Well, technically, it's my mom's house.

208
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,429
What are you writing down?

209
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,199
This isn't a session.

210
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,892
This doesn't count.

211
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,852
Just here to help Luis.

212
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,729
I understand.

213
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,733
So you sure you don't need me
to check him?

214
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,627
Nope.

215
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:10,903
Great.

216
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,256
Just sometimes

217
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,531
get insecure

218
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,034
about what I'm supposed to do
with my life.

219
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,370
I was on the inside
locked up for so long,

220
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,957
it's like I lost who I am on the outside.

221
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,792
Hmm.

222
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,420
That reminds me of Austin Powers.

223
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:33,151
Luis, I thought
we talked about this shit.

224
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:36,112
Hey, dawg,
I really thought about this, alright?

225
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,447
Just let me share my truth, okay?

226
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,532
Fine. Go.

227
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,933
You know, see, it's like this.

228
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,203
I was in prison
for a long-ass time, you know,

229
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:46,623
just like Austin Powers was frozen
in that block of ice for a long-ass time.

230
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,847
When we both got out,
we didn't know how to act anymore.

231
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:53,362
See, the thing is,
is Dr. Evil stole that fool's mojo.

232
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,966
You know, just like
the California prison system took my mojo.

233
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,951
And I know I'll never
get all my mojo back.

234
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,825
And, believe me,
I'm trying to make peace with that.

235
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,807
I'm just, you know, I'm tired
of wasting time living in the past.

236
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,812
Ideally, we'll change,
the world is ever-changing, homey.

237
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,295
I gotta change with it.

238
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,464
That's what Austin Powers is all about.

239
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,592
You know, I used to think
that movie was a comedy.

240
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,637
But now I know,

241
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,306
it's a tragedy.

242
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:25,119
- Okay. That's enough, Luis.
- Damn, bro.

243
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,831
I actually never even
thought about it like that.

244
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,290
Thank you, Luis.

245
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,961
Yeah, I totally relate
to that Austin Powers shit now.

246
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,671
Okay, well, you know what?

247
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,840
That's enough
Austin Powers talk for a while.

248
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,800
People here are
trying to do real work, Luis.

249
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:39,824
Julio.

250
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,911
Why do you always feel
the need to control me?

251
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:46,099
Look, playboy,
if I wasn't around to help your ass,

252
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,100
you'd be lost.

253
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,884
Sandy said you would
throw that in my face.

254
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,171
She told me you stopped by
her office earlier to talk about me.

255
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:55,817
Fuckin' snitch.

256
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,384
That was confidential.

257
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,988
Sandy just broke the law.

258
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:03,408
Yeah, well, Sandy says you said
it technically wasn't a session,

259
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,326
so it's actually public information now.

260
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,603
This is not the time
to share that information, okay?

261
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,456
People here are waiting to share, alright?

262
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,876
- Someone share. Come on.
- Hey, no, no, no. You're right.

263
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,861
The appropriate time would be
at therapy with me and Sandy.

264
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:21,491
Especially since you yourself
have never even been to therapy.

265
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:27,432
You've never been to therapy,
but you're leading a group hug session?

266
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,225
That's fucked up, Julio.

267
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,543
- Wow.
- You know what? Everybody calm down.

268
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:35,648
Group hug is not about me, okay?

269
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,026
It's about me helping all of you.

270
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,861
I don't need therapy. I'm all good.

271
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,029
Well, maybe the only way

272
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,697
you could help all of us out

273
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,116
is if you help yourself out first, homey.

274
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,660
Randy, whose fuckin' side are you on?

275
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,746
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Take a breath.

276
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,788
You okay?

277
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:54,459
'Cause Sandy says you and I
should go to therapy together, Julio.

278
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:58,046
Sandy says that'd actually be the best way
for me to make real progress.

279
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,530
Stop saying what Sandy says!

280
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,925
- Damn.
- Okay?

281
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,384
I'm not going to therapy with you.

282
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,136
Go tell Sandy I says that.

283
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,222
You know, that's funny
you're acting this way

284
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,665
'cause you always say
that you want what's best for me.

285
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,500
This is what's best for me.

286
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,169
At least that's what Sandy says.

287
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,190
- Yeah, partner.
- Mm-hmm.

288
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,507
Don't fuckin' touch me.

289
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,680
Thank you, Sandy. I always love your tea.

290
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,269
Julio, thank you for being open to this.

291
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:33,456
I'd like to start
by talking about your relationship

292
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,107
with Luis while you were growing up.

293
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,836
Luis tells me that as the older cousin,

294
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,445
he would bully you and make fun of you.

295
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,906
How do you feel about that?

296
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:46,285
- We were just dumb-ass kids.
- It-it's really not a big deal.

297
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,055
What about you, Luis?

298
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,205
Thanks for asking, Sandy.

299
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,667
Ah, you know, I just feel that Julio,

300
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,546
you know, he tries to
check me a lot as a grown-up

301
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:00,400
and I believe it's some form of revenge

302
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,486
for all the times that
I legitimately checked him as a kid.

303
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,072
Dawg, I'm your case manager,

304
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,098
and there's certain shit
I'm responsible for,

305
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,893
and sometimes I gotta check your ass.

306
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,204
There's that checking again.

307
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,914
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Check his ass, Sandy.

308
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,940
I'm not here to check anybody.

309
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,045
But I'm trying to understand
Julio's need to check.

310
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,047
I don't feel the need to check.

311
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,842
It's just Luis
needs to be checked sometimes.

312
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,468
May I speak?

313
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,660
Go ahead, Luis.

314
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,538
Listen, primo.

315
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:36,001
You know, I just feel that
you treat me like your little Mini-me,

316
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,670
when in actuality,

317
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:40,940
I'm regular-sized me.

318
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,734
Dawg, if you quote

319
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,277
Austin Powers one more time,

320
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,278
I'm gonna kill you.

321
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,071
And put your fuckin' hand down.

322
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,375
You see what I'm dealing with?

323
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,057
I have a suggestion.

324
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:54,078
I feel it would be healthy
for you to spend some time apart.

325
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,290
Hey, lady, I'm his fucking caseworker,
and we live together.

326
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,317
Well, we can't do anything
about the living situation,

327
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,879
but in my professional opinion,

328
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,465
your unresolved relationship issues

329
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,909
are getting in the way
of you being an effective case manager.

330
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,119
You hear what Sandy says?

331
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,515
Fine. Fuck it.

332
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:16,792
If you both are against me,
I won't be your case manager, okay?

333
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:20,128
Good luck finding someone who isn't family
to put up with your bullshit.

334
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:23,549
Have fun, Sandy.

335
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:27,678
Mm!

336
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,406
Chamomile, huh?

337
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,140
No, English Breakfast.

338
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,017
That's what's up.

339
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,551
- Great work, everyone.
- Really good shares.

340
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,344
Really, really good shares.
You killed it, Randy.

341
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,369
Thank you.

342
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,705
We missed you today, ese.

343
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,415
Damn, fool.

344
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,812
Hey, fool. Why didn't you wake me up?

345
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:01,896
I had to take the bus.

346
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,565
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

347
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,483
But I'm not your
case manager anymore.

348
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,301
I don't wanna control your life.

349
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,654
By the way, meet your new case manager.

350
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,180
Kestin, come here real quick.

351
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,891
This is the homey Kestin.

352
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,934
Hope you fools are happy together.

353
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,788
Hey, hey. What's up, man?

354
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,081
So nice to meet you.

355
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,000
You know, I'm really glad
we get to work together.

356
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,502
Hey, but I heard
you missed group hug today.

357
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,172
Yeah, you know, I overslept,
but Julio was supposed to wake me up.

358
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,924
Hmm. The tough thing
about relying on other people

359
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,825
is sometimes they might let you down.

360
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:35,346
That's why you always gotta be responsible
for your own actions.

361
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,040
Anyway, I gotta write you up.

362
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,893
The fuck, dawg?

363
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,186
Julio never wrote me up.

364
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,879
Oh. Well, my name's Kestin.

365
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,762
Take care.

366
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,350
Hey, you ate shit, dawg!

367
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,190
So why did you trip Kestin?

368
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,309
It was a joke, you know,
it was supposed to be funny.

369
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,630
You know, Kestin's got a stick up his ass.

370
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:53,424
Remember, we talked about
how all your joking around

371
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,367
is masking unresolved issues.

372
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,263
Something else bothering you?

373
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,413
I don't know.

374
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,500
I guess I maybe miss dumb-ass Julio
being my caseworker.

375
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,646
At least that fool
didn't write me up all the time.

376
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,150
Well, it sounds like Kestin is
holding you accountable for your actions.

377
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,026
It's a good thing.

378
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,989
It's also something
Julio is too codependent to do for you.

379
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:18,653
- Hey, hold up, Sandy.
- Don't talk about Julio like that, alright?

380
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,494
- We're still blood.
- That may be,

381
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,622
but we established
Julio's too controlling.

382
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:25,999
Hey, you know what?

383
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,376
Julio said that you're the one
that's too controlling, Sandy.

384
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,836
You ever think about that?

385
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,254
Luis, I didn't mean to...

386
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,630
Shh!

387
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,798
- Luis, uh...
- Shh!

388
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,466
- Uh, Luis, I...
- Shh!

389
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,926
- Luis, I...
- Shh, shh, shh!

390
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,160
Shh-shh, shh!

391
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:39,984
- Luis, I have to...
- Shh. Shh.

392
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,141
- Luis, let me just...
- Shh! Shh. Shh.

393
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,041
Shh.

394
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:46,895
What are you doing right now?

395
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,519
- What do you mean what am I doing?
- Come on, it's Austin Powers.

396
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,341
Sorry, I've never seen it.

397
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:53,926
What?

398
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:01,201
Hey, Jorge, did you finish
your GED homework?

399
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,476
Yup. All finished, chief.

400
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,496
Okay, good.

401
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,247
But have you started to résumé yet?

402
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,606
Yep. I'm almost finished.

403
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,830
I've been working very hard on it, chief.

404
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,711
Guess you never need me
to check you, huh?

405
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:14,238
Nah. I'll never
put you in that position.

406
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:16,031
Got a lot of respect for you.

407
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,968
Hey, chief, you wanna see
the five-year plan

408
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,094
to get my life back on track?

409
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,388
No, Jorge. I don't wanna see that.

410
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,890
Stop calling me chief.

411
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,499
- Okay, chief.
- Hey, Julio.

412
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,394
Think I could talk to you for a second?

413
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,522
Hey, Jorge, give us a minute.

414
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,906
Okay, chief, I'll go see
if they need help in the kitchen.

415
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,151
Yeah, you do that.

416
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,176
See you later, chief.

417
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,305
So what's up?

418
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:41,765
Not much.

419
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,976
How you been?

420
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:45,894
I've been good.

421
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:47,540
Life is good.

422
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:49,439
Oh, good, good.

423
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:51,650
How you been?

424
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,127
Good, I hope.

425
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,153
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm good, you know.

426
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:57,406
Nothing to complain about, really.

427
00:19:58,949 --> 00:19:59,802
Good. Good.

428
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:02,679
Well, hey, I should get going.

429
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:03,704
Oh, okay.

430
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,557
It was nice seeing you.

431
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,790
Yeah, good to see you too.

432
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,961
Hey.

433
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,202
Hey, you know what I found out?

434
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,984
That Sandy hasn't even seen Austin Powers.

435
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,653
- What? For real?
- Crazy, huh?

436
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,113
What, did she live
in a cave or something?

437
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,514
Yeah. A cave
that didn't even have cable.

438
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,994
I can't believe I was listening
to everything that bitch was saying to me.

439
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:28,037
Knowing everything
we know about her now,

440
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,101
she was probably wrong
about everything she told us.

441
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,459
Hey, you know what would
really piss Sandy off?

442
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,378
Is if you became
my case manager again.

443
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,070
That would drive her ass nuts.

444
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,507
Then she'd need to go to therapy.

445
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,759
- Too bad that shit don't even work.
- Therapy's for losers.

446
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:42,927
Lame-ass fools.

447
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,345
Don't even know
why you went in the first place.

448
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:47,748
Yeah, dawg, I don't know how the fuck
I thought that shit was gonna fix my life.

449
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,251
You need a ride?

450
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,922
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be cool.

451
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,237
Hey, but I still don't understand
why you don't eat the pizza crusts.

452
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,198
Dawg, I just don't like the taste.

453
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:05,450
That shit tastes like cardboard.
It's not that deep.

454
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,100
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

455
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,297
Hey, fool, I forgot something.

456
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,322
I'll catch you outside.

457
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,680
Can I help you with something, Julio?

458
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:30,791
Just wanted to let you know

459
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,377
Luis asked me to be
his case manager again.

460
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,630
I guess you were wrong.

461
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:38,983
I was only trying to help.

462
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,301
If that's what the two of you want,
then that's okay.

463
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:46,557
You thought you could destroy
a fuckin' family, didn't you, Sandy?

464
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,351
Fuckin' home-wrecker.

465
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,276
Hey, fuck Sandy.

466
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,239
Oh.

467
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:03,843
Come on, turn the wheel
all the way, dawg.

468
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:05,009
I got it. I got.

469
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,594
Cállate, pendejo. I got.

470
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,738
Alright, alright, alright.

471
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,163
- Oh.
- God.

472
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,417
Tsk.

473
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:15,728
Oh!

474
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:16,813
Come on, let me do it.

475
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,755
I can do it, you fuckin' idiot!

476
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,571
- Oh!
- Playin' bumper cars or what?

477
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:26,930
Who the fuck
parked their cars like this?

478
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:29,410
Ohh!

479
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:30,994
Even Miss Daisy drives better than this.

480
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,287
Man, shut up!

481
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:33,770
Just give me time.

482
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,940
Fuck! Help!
