1
00:00:02,486 --> 00:00:05,353
<i>The Dukes are coming in
for another landing.</i>

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,156
Couldn't keep away from me, gorgeous?

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,323
Young lady, you are in a peck of trouble.

4
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:18,991
I've got claustrophobia.

5
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,228
Is that catching, Sheriff?

6
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,035
These people are crazy!

7
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:29,571
I hope you weren't
too inconvenienced, <i>ma'am.</i>

8
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:30,646
<i>Coming at you.</i>

9
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:40,950
<i>There ain't no place where one little thing
can lead to a multiple catastrophe...</i>

10
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:43,315
<i>like it can in Hazzard County.</i>

11
00:01:48,392 --> 00:01:51,384
-Who was that guy?
-It don't make no difference.

12
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:53,964
-Teach him some manners.
-All right.

13
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:21,348
Well, that's showing him, Bo.

14
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:25,223
You know, I knew
you were gonna say that.

15
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:41,509
I'm telling you, I got a close-up look at it,
and it's the same car.

16
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:45,047
Sol suppose you're gonna tell me
he's in here, right?

17
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:53,180
<i>Now, you start with a little bumping
on a Hazzard County road...</i>

18
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,349
<i>then go to the Bears Nest...</i>

19
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:59,223
<i>add a stranger or two
who look like they're up to no good...</i>

20
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:01,190
<i>and a lot of spice...</i>

21
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:04,358
<i>mix in a little sugar, and watch out.</i>

22
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:05,492
What did he look like?

23
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,831
-He looked mean.
-And ugly.

24
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:10,134
That covers just about everybody in here.
Except me.

25
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,072
Well, I'd know him if I saw him again.

26
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,633
Good luck.

27
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:16,679
Y'all going to the Costume Clog
Dance Party tomorrow night?

28
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,147
Daisy, we ain't got time for that.
We got a race.

29
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:22,583
-It's the biggest dance all year.
-It's the only dance all year.

30
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:25,747
Wait till you see what I'm wearing:
short and fantastic.

31
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:27,984
I'm going as a circus bareback rider.

32
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:30,890
Hey, baby, I'd like to be your horse.

33
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:34,554
Okay, sugar.
As soon as I find the front end.

34
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:36,189
Ain't that him?

35
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,563
I don't take no dirt from a barmaid.

36
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:39,999
That's him.

37
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:05,391
All right.

38
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,025
Hush!

39
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:15,728
Now, she's the one
who started this whole thing.

40
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:21,338
Now, you see what you've done?

41
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,777
You're under arrest for grabbing at her...

42
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:27,577
and you two are under arrest
for swinging first.

43
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:30,186
-Enos, read them their rights.
-What?

44
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:33,455
You dumb dipstick, you soaked me--

45
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:36,390
One: Y'all have the right to remain silent.

46
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,589
Enos, they'll be out on bail
before you finish with that.

47
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,563
Just arrest them. Get them out of here.

48
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:52,634
Step one, Stanley.

49
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:58,979
$180, $190...

50
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:02,351
$200.

51
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:07,322
<i>Besides being the county commissioner,
Boss Hogg is also the justice of the peace.</i>

52
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:10,394
<i>That's kind of like having
a goat guard the cabbage patch.</i>

53
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:12,758
Sorry you made bail for them boys.

54
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:16,697
Seeing a Duke behind bars
is my favorite form of entertainment.

55
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:18,999
Mine, too.

56
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:25,366
Well, good morning.
I want to thank you boys.

57
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:26,442
Thank us?

58
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:29,444
For making my sunset years
so stimulating.

59
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:33,681
Now, you take this morning, for instance.

60
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:35,979
I got up and was going over...

61
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,283
to pay Jason Higgins
my $200 mortgage payment.

62
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:43,292
But, lo and behold, instead of making
my mortgage payment...

63
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:46,658
I find myself in here, paying your bail!

64
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,426
-Want to guess how much?
-$200?

65
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,203
Now we got to go to the bank,
take out what we've got left...

66
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:56,602
-and make that payment.
<i>-Came</i> an.

67
00:05:57,173 --> 00:06:00,768
Now, don't you Dukes
leave the country before trial.

68
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:02,470
Hold on up there!

69
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,314
-Ain't nobody going nowhere.
-Who's that?

70
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,850
That's Doc Petticord.
He's down there with that Colt fellow.

71
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:12,011
That's the guy that these two boys
beat the pudding out of.

72
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,795
Rosco, I want you to make sure
nobody leaves here.

73
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:23,388
What're you doing here, Doc?

74
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,231
Tending the sick, Jesse.
What the hell else do I do?

75
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:28,566
Come on, Doc, I didn't hit him that hard.

76
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:31,141
Now, listen. Everybody listen good.

77
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,509
I don't want to start a panic.

78
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,511
But this sure looks
like some kind of plague.

79
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,947
Plague?

80
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:40,573
Until I know more,
as county health officer...

81
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:44,312
I'm declaring this jail
and everybody in it quarantined.

82
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:47,718
Quarantined?

83
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,849
I'm just a lovable old country doctor.

84
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,590
I ain't had me a good epidemic
since the hog cholera of '43...

85
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:55,731
and that was mostly pigs.

86
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,961
This sure looks like pneumonic
or bubonic plague.

87
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:07,375
I“ don't get that mortgage payment
to Jason Higgins before midnight...

88
00:07:08,878 --> 00:07:10,073
we lose it.

89
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:12,705
<i>And to think, this all got started...</i>

90
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,080
<i>because this jackass wanted
to be a horse for Daisy.</i>

91
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:37,373
Step two, Stanley.

92
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:41,069
<i>What do you reckon them two are up to?</i>

93
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:43,970
<i>Anyway, a little later...</i>

94
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:47,713
Rosco, I can't stand this anymore:

95
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:49,546
you working out of my office.

96
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:52,987
Besides, I gotta find me
a decent place to sleep...

97
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,251
in this pigsty you call a jail.

98
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:57,793
These accommodations stink!

99
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:02,190
Boss, they're supposed to stink.
See, this is a jail.

100
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:03,697
We work at that.

101
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,430
Rosco, I wish, I just wish...

102
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:10,668
you would use your head
for something other...

103
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:13,334
than a handy place to hang your teeth.

104
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:17,210
Listen, there's two cells downstairs...

105
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:20,044
but that sick guy's in one
and the Dukes are in the other.

106
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:21,776
Well, then, I'll sleep up here.

107
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,183
I ain't sleeping downstairs
with the criminal element.

108
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,655
Where you gonna sleep up here?

109
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:31,585
How about there?

110
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:35,422
You <i>mean</i> this old cell?

111
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:38,835
They haven't used that for 75 years.

112
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,462
This is where they used to put the guy
just before they hang him.

113
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:45,406
Sounds perfect for you, Boss.

114
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:48,375
Don't give me sass, Duke boy.
I'm feeling testy.

115
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:51,140
-Luke, what are you doing?
-I'm calling Daisy.

116
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,215
Listen, don't use that but once.

117
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:55,818
You're only supposed to use it once
when you're in jail.

118
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,286
-Rosco, we ain't prisoners.
-You will be if you use that phone again.

119
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,756
Boss, see, what we use this cell for...

120
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:04,919
is just for supplies and for Enos' comics.

121
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:07,554
All right, I'll take it!

122
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:12,299
Just move that junk out
and put my other barber chair in there.

123
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,936
Boss, you gonna sleep
in your barber chair?

124
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:21,537
I been sleeping in it half the time
since I married your fat sister.

125
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:27,010
Leastways that chair don't roll over
on me in the middle of the night.

126
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:31,316
But, Luke, I've got to change.
I just got fitted for my costume.

127
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:35,016
<i>-Now, is Uncle Jesse--</i>
-He's fine. Look, nobody else is sick.

128
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,286
Now don't panic.

129
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:39,225
Get that mortgage money
to Jason Higgins before midnight.

130
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,061
You just take care of Uncle Jesse,
and I'm on my way to the bank right now.

131
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,634
-All right?
<i>-Well, hurry.</i>

132
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,293
Okay, all right!

133
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:49,728
<i>Now, anybody that knows anything
about Hazzard County...</i>

134
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,104
<i>knows that it just ain't gonna be that easy.</i>

135
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,703
-Here.
-Thank you.

136
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,948
Bo tells me you think something's up.

137
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,106
It's that Colt.

138
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,776
Something peculiar is going on there.
His fever's down...

139
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:06,617
and if the doc hadn't looked at him,
I'd swear he's faking being unconscious.

140
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:09,886
Why would anybody fake the plague
just to stay in jail?

141
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:12,758
Beats me. It's gonna take some cogitating.

142
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,457
-One thing's sure, it ain't the coffee.
-You can say that again.

143
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:20,498
-What are we gonna do about food?
-Cooter volunteered to bring it in.

144
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:23,834
No wonder. A plague would dry up
and die on Cooter.

145
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,608
There she is, Mr. Hogg.
Ready to move right in.

146
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:32,113
-Good work, Enos.
-Thank you, sir.

147
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:38,380
-Enos.
-Yes, sir?

148
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:41,717
Did you lock that door?

149
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:47,159
Yes. That must be out of force of habit.
I'm sorry, Mr. Hogg.

150
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,930
-Unlock the door, son.
-Yes, sir.

151
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,908
-It's stuck.
-Stuck?

152
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:12,287
Rosco! Get in here!

153
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,721
What can I do for you, Boss?

154
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:18,851
Your pea-brained ninny of a deputy
locked me in!

155
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,529
He did?

156
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:25,627
-Unlock the door, Enos.
-Yes, sir, but it won't unlock.

157
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:28,638
Well, then, get out of the way
and let me do it.

158
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:30,631
You dumb dipstick.

159
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:38,076
It's a little rusty. It's just old, and I don't...

160
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:42,212
That it?

161
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,578
No, not exactly.

162
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:50,226
You see, that's the key,
but it needs that little piece up here...

163
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,095
Rosco, I've got claustrophobia.

164
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,624
Is that catching, Sheriff?

165
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,537
You two ain't got the combined
intelligence of a pot of turnips.

166
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:06,000
I know it.

167
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:08,578
And get them Dukes downstairs!

168
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:10,646
I'll get them right away.

169
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,575
Get him out of here.

170
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:19,987
Okay, I ain't gonna tell you
but one time. Downstairs.

171
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,319
-Let's humor him, boys. It's his jail.
-All right.

172
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:34,094
"All hope abandon, ye who enter here."

173
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:37,231
Where'd you come up
with that bit of sunshine, Rosco?

174
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,331
My sweet <i>mama</i> does needlepoint.

175
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:42,070
Gives a sort of a homey touch,
don't you think?

176
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,910
As I recall, that's supposed
to be the sign over the gates of Hell.

177
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:49,508
Very appropriate.
That's from Dante's <i>Inferno.</i> Ain't it?

178
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,382
From my <i>mama.</i> Hush!

179
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:16,839
Would you look at that?

180
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,409
Hello, gorgeous.

181
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:27,656
I'm just a lonely stranger in town.
So, why don't you show me the sights...

182
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:31,318
-starting with you.
-Have you seen our jail? It's a sight.

183
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:36,755
So long, gorgeous.

184
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:39,426
That was very sick, Stanley.

185
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:41,736
We're working. Let's go.

186
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:53,004
-Hey, Rose Ellen, y'all been busy?
-The mill payday.

187
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:56,816
We sure missed you
in church Sunday, Daisy.

188
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,614
Are you singing this week?

189
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:00,812
Now.

190
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:32,087
$200.

191
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:36,014
All right, everybody!

192
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:40,324
Everybody do exactly as you're told,
and nobody will be hurt.

193
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,956
-So, hands above your head.
-Thank you.

194
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,600
Come on, now.

195
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,969
Where is yours?

196
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,440
Thank you.

197
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,638
Hello, gorgeous.

198
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:04,751
Let's go. Everybody in the back room.
Let's go. Come on.

199
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,648
Let's go. Hurry.

200
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:09,123
No, don't lock us up in there. No!

201
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:17,593
-Everybody, let's go. Move it!
-Nothing will happen.

202
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,909
I don't like it in there.
It makes me wheeze.

203
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:31,707
Come on.

204
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,241
What happened to gorgeous?

205
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:38,752
Can't you even forget women
long enough to rob a bank?

206
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,004
Will you come on?

207
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:12,353
Anybody spots us, start shooting.

208
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:24,157
Did you get them?

209
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:34,672
<i>Hang on, Daisy. You got them now.</i>

210
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,749
-Possum on a gum bush!
<i>-Nape,</i>

211
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:49,415
<i>It's Daisy on an RV.</i>

212
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:19,351
Just stay loose, goose, I'm coming.

213
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:24,794
-I think we have company.
-Yeah.

214
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,290
Can't you shake him?

215
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,522
I'm trying to, Stanley.

216
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,366
Hang on, Daisy.

217
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:46,946
Why don't you pop him?

218
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:54,189
All right, I'll pop him.

219
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:00,195
Hang on, Daisy.

220
00:18:10,273 --> 00:18:12,799
<i>While Daisy was playing gangbusters...</i>

221
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:16,401
<i>old Bo and Luke were puttering around,
looking for something to do.</i>

222
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:19,105
Here, Boss. I brought you a little coffee
for your nerves.

223
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:23,014
Rosco, what am I supposed to do
if I have to get out of here?

224
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:26,613
You know, have to.

225
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:37,861
Got it, Sheriff. Hazzard County Sheriff.

226
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:42,597
For you, Sheriff. Rose Ellen at the bank.

227
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,571
Let me have it. Here.

228
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:54,879
Rose Ellen, I told you
not to call me here at work.

229
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:57,316
You cute little rascal, you.

230
00:19:00,256 --> 00:19:01,951
The bank was robbed?

231
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:03,859
My bank?

232
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:06,156
By Laurel and Hardy?

233
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:08,962
Find out how much money they got.

234
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,624
Was anybody hurt?

235
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,868
-Go get Jesse.
-Yeah.

236
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:16,166
-Nobody was hurt.
-How much did they get?

237
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:19,804
Did anybody see the vehicle
that they got away in?

238
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:22,443
-What about Daisy?
-Don't know, but nobody was hurt.

239
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:24,013
That must <i>mean</i> she's okay then.

240
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:26,513
Rosco, how much did they get?

241
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:30,384
Enos, take this down.

242
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:34,050
"The bank robbers...

243
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:39,018
"drove away in one
of those big RV campers."

244
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:40,854
Only in Hazzard.

245
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:44,198
I'll be right there.

246
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:50,571
No, I can't come. I'm in quarantine.

247
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:55,310
Well, just tell them to sit tight.

248
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:59,279
Rosco, for the last time,
how much money did they get?

249
00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:00,816
Two bagfuls.

250
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:03,716
That's not a very accurate count.

251
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,981
You might say that.

252
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,393
This is Sheriff Rosco Coltrane
calling all deputies.

253
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,392
Coltrane calling all deputies. Come on.

254
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,663
Sheriff, all the deputies
are quarantined in here.

255
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,905
Hazzard County Sheriff. Hey, Cooter.

256
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:30,773
Cooter just chased an RV camper
with Daisy hanging on top.

257
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,672
Let me have it.

258
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,445
How long ago was that,
and which way did they go?

259
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,514
About 30 minutes.

260
00:20:41,557 --> 00:20:43,025
Heading north?

261
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:47,354
I'm sorry, Jesse.

262
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,436
I'll tell you something, boys.

263
00:20:56,539 --> 00:21:01,033
One thing about a crisis:
You sure learn what ain't important.

264
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:04,508
With Daisy in this trouble...

265
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:07,742
losing that farm
don't amount to a hill of beans.

266
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:11,416
Uncle Jesse, what if the plague
ain't for real?

267
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,954
That's a big if, Bo.

268
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:16,456
-And a whole passel of coincidences if it is.
-What do you mean?

269
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,324
Look, a guy picks a fight,
gets thrown in jail...

270
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:22,659
he gets sick, gets himself
and the police quarantined...

271
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:24,426
on the same day a bank is robbed.

272
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,501
And on the mill's payday.

273
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:30,839
Look, Uncle Jesse, you yourself said
that he might be faking some.

274
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,238
Which could tie him in
with them bank robbers.

275
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:34,935
If that's true...

276
00:21:35,478 --> 00:21:39,574
it's gonna take a lot of tall shucking
to outsmart them fellas. They're good.

277
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,350
All right. I'll have Rosco call Doc...

278
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,614
and see if he can take another look at Colt.

279
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,590
We ought to figure out an escape plan,
just in case.

280
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:54,493
There will be no escape
until we're sure this plague is phony.

281
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:57,794
And while you two are at it...

282
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:01,562
figure out how we're gonna find Daisy,
when nobody else can.

283
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,916
Funniest people in the world.

284
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:20,948
You think you can tear yourself away
and give me a hand?

285
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:22,683
I'm the boss, Stanley.

286
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:26,125
All right already with the Stanley bit.
My name is Irving.

287
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:27,557
Humor me.

288
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:31,224
Next job, you'll be Abbott
and I'll be Costello.

289
00:22:37,473 --> 00:22:39,464
-Unload the RV.
-Unload?

290
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,608
I just locked it.
How come we gotta unload it now?

291
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:45,373
Because we're going to sink it
in the lake, Stanley.

292
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:46,948
That's Irving.

293
00:22:47,316 --> 00:22:50,115
And we're not doing that fill tomorrow,
when Colt gets here.

294
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:52,153
Nothing like being ready.

295
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,315
I'm still very peeved at you, Stanley.

296
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,553
Talking to that beautiful girl in the bank
was <i>trés stupido</i>.

297
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:02,654
I had to pick a part-time sex maniac
for a partner.

298
00:23:02,932 --> 00:23:04,422
Tacky, Stanley.

299
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,101
Lay out the money, and I'll count it.

300
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:15,173
<i>Now to get to that CB and call for help...</i>

301
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:17,837
<i>all Daisy's got to do is climb down...</i>

302
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:20,573
<i>break in without being shot or worse.</i>

303
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,116
<i>So what's the problem?</i>

304
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,718
<i>She's a Duke.</i>

305
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,915
<i>That's the problem.</i>

306
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:36,489
<i>And I think she's got a long way to go.</i>

307
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:42,260
Boss, I was just downstairs,
talking to old Jesse.

308
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:45,739
He thinks maybe that plague is fake.
So I'll call Dr. Petticord.

309
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,002
-Rosco.
-What?

310
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:49,203
You ain't gonna call nobody.

311
00:23:49,545 --> 00:23:51,513
-Boss, now, listen--
-No, you listen.

312
00:23:51,614 --> 00:23:53,946
I just figured this whole thing out.

313
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:58,111
Now, tell me. Why is that fellow
Colt in jail in the first place?

314
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,157
Because he was fighting
with Bo and Luke Duke.

315
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:04,759
Pretended to.

316
00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:09,287
And who is off
with them bank robbers right now?

317
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:13,861
Daisy.

318
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,764
You see, pea brain, the Dukes are in on it.

319
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,336
Now, let me ask you something.

320
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:24,245
Why would old Jesse jeopardize the farm?

321
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,480
Because he ain't in on it.

322
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,953
Them Duke boys didn't know their scheme
would clash with Jesse's mortgage.

323
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:34,647
So they got caught in their own trap.

324
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:37,153
And you ain't calling Doc...

325
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:40,524
because you got three of the robbers
in jail right now.

326
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:42,791
Colt and Bo and Luke Duke.

327
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:46,734
But, Boss, what happens
if that plague is real?

328
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:48,933
Then, we just sit tight...

329
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:51,769
and Jesse loses the farm either way.

330
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:57,671
Boss, why should do you care?
Higgins owns the mortgage on that farm.

331
00:24:57,813 --> 00:24:59,008
No, he don't.

332
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:02,882
I bought all Jason's holdings last week.

333
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:06,151
By midnight tonight,
that farm will be mine.

334
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,245
Yours?

335
00:25:07,356 --> 00:25:10,018
I'm gonna burn it down, plow it up...

336
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:13,024
and have me a real nice junkyard.

337
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:16,828
I love it.

338
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:21,166
Rosco, get me out of here. I'm going crazy.

339
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:34,441
Couldn't keep away from me, gorgeous?

340
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,018
-Let go! Let go of me!
-Oh, no.

341
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,155
-You're going with me.
-Let go of me!

342
00:25:42,324 --> 00:25:45,089
-You're going right with me.
-Let go!

343
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:48,487
You're going right with me.

344
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:58,363
Young lady, you are in a peck of trouble.

345
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,006
<i>Do y'all realize
that this whole mess got started...</i>

346
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,914
<i>by two cars just bumping into each other?</i>

347
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:16,024
<i>Like I said...</i>

348
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:18,659
<i>y'all realize
that this whole mess got started...</i>

349
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:21,253
<i>by two cars bumping into each other?</i>

350
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:24,663
<i>While Luke was doing a little sabotage
for the breakout...</i>

351
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:26,701
<i>by doing some repairs...</i>

352
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:31,199
<i>Ba was diverting everybody's attention
With Jesse's old card tricks.</i>

353
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,736
<i>And that boy had a tough audience.</i>

354
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,674
All right, I'll show you one card trick.

355
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:38,975
-I want you to pick a card.
-I don't believe in gambling, Bo.

356
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:43,017
Enos, it's not gambling. Will you pick
a card, or we'll be here all day.

357
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,481
-You got it?
-Yep. Two of hearts.

358
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:48,818
Enos, you're not supposed
to tell him the card.

359
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:50,153
Dipstick.

360
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:53,058
All right, Enos,
let's try it one more time, okay?

361
00:26:53,162 --> 00:26:54,323
Oh, no.

362
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:57,898
-This time, don't tell me what it is.
-Don't tell him.

363
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:00,259
Now, pick a card.

364
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,998
-You got it?
-Yeah.

365
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:06,165
-Okay.
-Can I ask a question?

366
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:07,299
Sure.

367
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:11,403
The little black three-leaf clover,
is that clubs or spades?

368
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,517
Enos, don't help him
any more than you have to.

369
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,017
Give me that, Enos. Let's see it.

370
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:19,948
We're gonna try again, all right?

371
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:28,354
That's your card, ain't it?

372
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:30,989
I'll be ding-danged.
You know how he did that, Sheriff?

373
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:32,834
Magic.

374
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:37,728
<i>Downstairs, Jesse was trying to trick Colt
to see if the plague was phony.</i>

375
00:27:39,374 --> 00:27:42,400
That was smart. Real smart.

376
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,840
You getting the law all quarantined...

377
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,919
while the rest of them hit the bank.

378
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:54,915
That was good. Real good.

379
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:58,152
Except you made one mistake.

380
00:27:58,327 --> 00:28:00,318
You picked Hazzard County...

381
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,491
where the only law
is Boss Hogg and Rosco.

382
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:08,034
So, me and my boys
is going to make a run for it.

383
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:10,230
We invite you to come along.

384
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:12,774
I“ know Rosco, and I do...

385
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:18,342
your partners are gonna have
all that money split and spent...

386
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,710
by the time he turns you loose.

387
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:36,463
Did you fix up the squeaky wheels
on my chair?

388
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:38,329
-Sure did.
-Thank you.

389
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,061
You're welcome.

390
00:28:45,274 --> 00:28:48,300
It's all planned. Getaway car, everything.

391
00:28:51,747 --> 00:28:52,976
Seems a shame.

392
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:58,019
Big-time pro like you,
rotting away in a hick town jail.

393
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,617
-You all set?
-Yeah, we're all ready.

394
00:29:29,718 --> 00:29:32,653
I hope Cooter got that message
I smuggled out with the lunch.

395
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:35,155
-I hope he can read.
-Now, listen.

396
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,287
I think I may have struck out with Colt...

397
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,821
so if he don't go, we don't go.
You understand?

398
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,630
Sure hope this works.

399
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:58,846
Jailbreak!

400
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,973
Where?

401
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,652
Jailbreak!

402
00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:12,727
Enos, let me out of here.

403
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:14,588
This door's stuck.

404
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:17,424
-Come here, you pigskin, open the door.
-I'm trying.

405
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:23,601
Rosco, get in here!

406
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:32,977
Let's get out of here!

407
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,623
They're getting away.

408
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,096
Don't touch me. Get them.

409
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:59,470
Old Cooter got the message.

410
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:01,872
He even put it back together for us.

411
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:09,407
If we hadn't made a cute remark to her
while robbing...

412
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:10,609
we wouldn't have this mess!

413
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:13,380
How would I know she'd get so turned on
she'd follow me?

414
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:15,513
Oh, no. That's not how it was, sugar.

415
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,991
Do you mind if I sit down while y'all fuss?

416
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:21,495
These new shoes I bought
for the costume cotillion are killing me.

417
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:23,758
Y'all going to the cotillion?

418
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,726
You know, the way you two dress
when you rob banks...

419
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:28,997
I bet you'll take first prize.

420
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,231
The costume bit is his idea.

421
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:34,838
The last bank job,
he was Dracula and I was Wolf man.

422
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,168
Yes, and you were terrible.

423
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,008
Now, get a rope and tie her up.

424
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,946
I figured we'd hear a lot more traffic
on the police radio.

425
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,449
Don't worry, we will.

426
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:46,180
Look, Cooter even packed us a lunch.

427
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:48,222
Lunch? Great. I'm starved.

428
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:51,815
I hope y'all ain't planning
on stopping for lunch.

429
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,891
<i>This is Hazzard Sheriff Rosco Coltrane.
All units, report in.</i>

430
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,131
All units. What units?

431
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:03,235
<i>This is Choctaw Sheriff Emitt Ragsdale,
with all units reporting.</i>

432
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:09,142
Sheriff Ragsdale from Choctaw County?

433
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:11,406
With two more cars, he'd invade Russia.

434
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:12,980
Wow, that many?

435
00:32:13,115 --> 00:32:14,549
No, that mean.

436
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:16,443
Hold on, listen up.

437
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:20,453
This is Sheriff Rosco Coltrane
calling Hammerhand. Over.

438
00:32:20,555 --> 00:32:23,217
This is Choctaw Sheriff Emitt Ragsdale.

439
00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:26,818
You will use correct radio procedure
on police business. Over.

440
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:28,589
I'm sorry about that, Hammerhead...

441
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,922
<i>Hand.</i>

442
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:34,830
Listen, did you or your boys
spot any of the fugitives? Over.

443
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:39,430
Negative. We have all primaries blocked
with roving patrols on secondaries.

444
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:42,204
Good. Whatever that means.

445
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:46,906
Listen, Hammer, Sheriff,
we're gonna move north and join you.

446
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,143
I want you to be real careful,
because those fugitives are tough.

447
00:32:50,285 --> 00:32:52,720
So are we. Out.

448
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:55,448
The Choctaw
and Hazzard sheriffs together?

449
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,322
Don't forget the FBI and the state patrol.

450
00:32:58,827 --> 00:33:00,386
What are they after us for?

451
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:02,964
Bank robbery is a federal rap, man.

452
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,931
Welcome to the big time, boys.

453
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,999
Now, wait a minute.
We didn't rob no bank.

454
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,503
Tell that to the judge,
after they get you there.

455
00:33:14,376 --> 00:33:15,901
And every road blocked.

456
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:19,037
-I guess we only got one choice.
-Go for it.

457
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:45,333
Chains?

458
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:48,271
I couldn't find any rope.

459
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:50,038
No way.

460
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:54,110
You flake.

461
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,309
Get her, Stanley.

462
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:25,074
You all right back there?

463
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:31,038
-That looked like old Hammerhand.
-You better step on it, he's after us.

464
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,729
Helicopters. Gonna need helicopters.

465
00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:31,899
It looks like Rosco's gonna give us a hand.

466
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,542
What kind of untrained...

467
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:06,533
Coltrane, your driving is substandard.

468
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,036
I didn't turn over.

469
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:10,802
Do you reckon we ought to help him?

470
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:14,575
Will you hush? He ain't hurt.
Turn off the lights.

471
00:37:14,716 --> 00:37:15,911
Yes, sir.

472
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:23,614
Make sure you tie her well, Stanley.

473
00:37:26,795 --> 00:37:30,595
You win, gorgeous. No chains.
Just fishing line.

474
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:35,769
Thanks. I have always depended
on the kindness of strangers, Stanley.

475
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,828
The <i>name</i> is Irving.

476
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:40,600
What do we do now?

477
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:46,477
We're gonna sit tight till dark.
That way our chances will be better.

478
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:48,212
Then what?

479
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,613
Shoot, we reckoned
you were going to tell us.

480
00:37:50,718 --> 00:37:53,119
Look, we're neck-deep
in this thing already.

481
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:56,782
We was thinking maybe we could
throw in with you and your partners.

482
00:37:57,826 --> 00:37:58,816
Oh, yeah?

483
00:37:58,927 --> 00:38:01,225
Luke and me, we're both great wheel men.

484
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,826
Wheel men?

485
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,063
Breaking out of jail ought to prove
we can handle ourselves.

486
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,965
Come on, how about it?

487
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:09,661
Tell you what I'm going to do.

488
00:38:10,338 --> 00:38:13,399
I'm gonna take you to the boss
and let him decide.

489
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:14,475
Deal.

490
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:16,736
You gotta tell me one thing.

491
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:19,470
How did you fake the plague?

492
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:23,217
Now that was simple.

493
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:26,618
-I'm allergic to poison ivy, right?
-Yeah?

494
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,020
When I get in the jail...

495
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:33,026
I just peel back the tape,
and expose the poison ivy.

496
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:37,324
Then I get the rash...

497
00:38:37,432 --> 00:38:40,402
I get the swelling, I even get a little fever.

498
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:43,294
Then I fake all the other symptoms
of the plague...

499
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:47,602
like delirium, cramping,
all that sort of stuff, you know.

500
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:50,235
And then, man, it looks real good.

501
00:38:50,445 --> 00:38:53,142
Looks just like the plague.

502
00:38:53,848 --> 00:38:56,510
Boy, it was beautiful. Really beautiful.

503
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:02,721
Anyway, do you realize
there ain't never been...

504
00:39:02,857 --> 00:39:07,055
no doctor ever seen a case of the plague
in this part of the country?

505
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,254
Do you know something, Luke?

506
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:15,462
It is sure going to be a pleasure
to work with a real professional, ain't it?

507
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:18,934
-You figure we can ever be that good?
-I don't know.

508
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:33,550
<i>Do y'all realize they ain't no closer
to Daisy than they were in jail?</i>

509
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,534
What are you doing here? You're supposed
to be in jail until tomorrow.

510
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,471
Can't anybody do anything right?

511
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:55,566
But, boss, I ran into some trouble
back there.

512
00:39:55,677 --> 00:39:56,667
What happened?

513
00:39:56,778 --> 00:39:59,577
You poor man, that's a terrible case
of poison ivy.

514
00:39:59,714 --> 00:40:02,240
You see, it didn't work in jail either.

515
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:03,680
Some hillbilly spotted me.

516
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:07,380
-Where's your car?
-I had to make a getaway in this thing.

517
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:09,382
Ain't that the girl from the bar?

518
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,288
Yeah, she belongs to me.

519
00:40:11,392 --> 00:40:12,826
Look, dummy...

520
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,555
are we supposed to sneak out of here
in an orange stock car...

521
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,598
with a big number one on the side...

522
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,964
and a Confederate flag on the roof?

523
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:22,468
Look, little man...

524
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,835
it'll be a whole lot easier
than trying to hide her.

525
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:27,570
Imbeciles.

526
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:29,474
It was a very simple plan.

527
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:33,104
These two idiots couldn't follow
instructions on a cereal box.

528
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:35,875
Y'all don't get along very well, do you?

529
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:40,053
-No, young lady, we don't.
-I wanna see the money.

530
00:40:40,154 --> 00:40:43,852
I think you should see about getting
some calamine lotion on that poison ivy.

531
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,448
Ger her inside.

532
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:51,558
Because of your stupidity,
we're gonna have to dump that RV truck...

533
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:54,567
and escape in that clown car.

534
00:41:10,351 --> 00:41:14,515
<i>Looks like the Dukes got a little
shuck and jive working, don't it?</i>

535
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:17,186
Listen, I want to know
how we did on the money.

536
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:20,192
That may all prove to be academic
if we don't get away.

537
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:26,965
Right now, we happen
to have a more pressing problem.

538
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,226
What are we gonna do with her?

539
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:34,034
Right now, I'm thinking about sinking her
in the lake with the RV...

540
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,640
where there's no witnesses.

541
00:41:49,123 --> 00:41:51,455
Hey, this is Cooter coming at you.

542
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,117
Y'all got your ears on?

543
00:41:53,628 --> 00:41:55,995
-Come in, Cooter.
-It <i>worked.</i>

544
00:41:57,799 --> 00:42:00,166
Boy, we thought he'd never steal that car.

545
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:01,829
Me, too. Hey, y'all...

546
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:05,731
I'm down here
at old Bubba's fishing shack...

547
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,740
the one that Boss Hogg foreclosed on.

548
00:42:08,342 --> 00:42:10,276
<i>You mean Bearclaw Swamp?</i>

549
00:42:10,912 --> 00:42:14,314
The very same.
Now look here, Daisy's all right.

550
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:16,679
But there's three of them,
and they got shotguns...

551
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,752
and looks like they're fixing to leave.

552
00:42:18,886 --> 00:42:21,878
<i>Got you. You're gonna
have to delay them, Cooter.</i>

553
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:24,287
Okay, I will. That's a big 10-4.

554
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:26,292
-But y'all hurry.
<i>-Did you copy that, Jesse?</i>

555
00:42:26,828 --> 00:42:28,819
Loud and clear, Luke, and I'm on the way.

556
00:42:29,163 --> 00:42:30,460
I got them now.

557
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,531
<i>-Do you copy that, Rosco?
-You bet</i> I <i>copy.</i>

558
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,799
-And when I get my hands on you--
-Bearclaw Swamp?

559
00:42:39,006 --> 00:42:41,566
That's at the other end of the county.

560
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:43,834
Enos, I know where it is.

561
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,789
Wait a minute! I'm not into exotic stuff
like stuffing a broad.

562
00:43:00,728 --> 00:43:02,753
Don't look at me. I've been sick.

563
00:43:02,864 --> 00:43:05,458
-Fellas, could I say something here?
-No!

564
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,097
You may not.

565
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,307
This is all your fault.

566
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:17,503
It was a perfect bank heist,
with a true theatrical flair.

567
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:19,803
It worked twice without a hitch.

568
00:43:19,947 --> 00:43:21,881
And then we hit Hazzard.

569
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:23,642
It was a perfect setup.

570
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:27,910
An outmoded bank,
an inept police department...

571
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,884
and then we met you.

572
00:43:31,058 --> 00:43:32,287
Disaster.

573
00:43:35,096 --> 00:43:38,760
Let's see, Cooter said that
there's three guys with shotguns?

574
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:43,298
You don't need me. I'll just take a nap.

575
00:43:43,404 --> 00:43:45,702
-You can handle it.
-Left-handed.

576
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:49,167
I sure hope Cooter is being creative.

577
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:05,450
How're you?

578
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,389
Now, sugar,
before you get yourself all het up...

579
00:44:09,497 --> 00:44:11,625
things just happen to be different
in Hazzard.

580
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,894
Actually, y'all fit right in.

581
00:44:14,101 --> 00:44:15,535
Why don't you stick around?

582
00:44:15,636 --> 00:44:19,595
I'll bet if you gave that money back
and apologized real sweet...

583
00:44:21,342 --> 00:44:23,106
Stick around Hazzard?

584
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:25,336
Wrong!

585
00:44:29,016 --> 00:44:31,110
-Who's that?
-Why, Cooter!

586
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,549
Hey, Daisy.

587
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,048
-How you been?
-Fine. And you?

588
00:44:35,156 --> 00:44:38,217
-I can't complain.
-What is going on?

589
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:41,458
Caught this guy
goofing around with the RV tires.

590
00:44:41,629 --> 00:44:43,927
The place is crawling with them.

591
00:44:44,065 --> 00:44:45,464
Where did you come from?

592
00:44:45,566 --> 00:44:47,227
See if you can guess.

593
00:44:47,335 --> 00:44:51,101
Maybe we ought to sink the RV
before something else crawls out of there.

594
00:44:51,205 --> 00:44:55,699
You know, that's gonna take y'all
a while 'cause it's got two flat tires.

595
00:44:56,544 --> 00:44:59,639
Tie them both up, put them in the RV,
and sink it.

596
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,842
-Can I ask you a question?
-No, you may not.

597
00:45:03,985 --> 00:45:06,579
Okay, good. If y'all sink that RV...

598
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,655
how are you gonna get out of here?

599
00:45:08,756 --> 00:45:11,817
We'll make our getaway
in the little orange car.

600
00:45:11,926 --> 00:45:14,258
Yeah? It ain't gonna start nohow.

601
00:45:14,428 --> 00:45:16,396
I hid the distributor cap...

602
00:45:16,731 --> 00:45:18,859
right before I did them tires.

603
00:45:20,735 --> 00:45:22,225
Get over there.

604
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:26,272
All right, you two, get out there
and start that car.

605
00:45:26,374 --> 00:45:27,967
What's that noise?

606
00:45:28,276 --> 00:45:29,505
Now what?

607
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:33,209
Stop him.

608
00:46:15,623 --> 00:46:18,251
They're throwing dynamite!

609
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,623
You didn't say anything about dynamite.

610
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:36,004
These people are crazy!

611
00:46:53,928 --> 00:46:56,260
Hold it right there.

612
00:46:56,364 --> 00:46:59,334
Come on here. Get in here.

613
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:03,102
Don't slop all over me, now.
This is my good uniform.

614
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:13,411
Sure was nice of y'all to get here
just in time to take all the credit.

615
00:47:13,948 --> 00:47:17,851
Will you hush? Any more flap-lip
out of you, I'll cuff you, too.

616
00:47:18,052 --> 00:47:21,955
<i>You are surrounded. Throw down
your weapons and put your hands up.</i>

617
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,080
Hammerhand.

618
00:47:24,191 --> 00:47:26,592
How many times do you have
to surrender around here?

619
00:47:26,694 --> 00:47:28,719
I said hands up, everybody.

620
00:47:29,697 --> 00:47:32,689
-You just--
-Hello, Coltrane. What are you doing here?

621
00:47:33,334 --> 00:47:35,063
All right, move out.

622
00:47:35,836 --> 00:47:37,463
Hammerhand, now listen...

623
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:39,596
this is Hazzard County. This is my county.

624
00:47:39,707 --> 00:47:42,108
And I'll do all the arresting in...

625
00:47:42,743 --> 00:47:44,507
Hot pursuit, Sheriff.

626
00:47:45,012 --> 00:47:46,707
-Look it up.
-You...

627
00:47:50,818 --> 00:47:53,719
I hope you weren't
too inconvenienced, <i>ma'am.</i>

628
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:57,683
All right, men, move them out.

629
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,022
You tin-badged robot!

630
00:48:01,062 --> 00:48:03,053
I think he's kind of cute.

631
00:48:03,664 --> 00:48:05,132
For a sheriff.

632
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:08,525
We played it pretty close.
Got only one stick left.

633
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,400
You know what we ought to do with that?

634
00:48:10,504 --> 00:48:13,997
We ought to offer to blast Boss
right out of his cell.

635
00:48:19,246 --> 00:48:21,237
He'd be just a big, white smithereen.

636
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:25,348
<i>That's the legend of the Hazzard Plague...</i>

637
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,883
<i>in which nobody caught nothing.</i>

638
00:48:28,122 --> 00:48:32,059
<i>Especially Rosco, who didn't even ca tab
the bank robbers.</i>
