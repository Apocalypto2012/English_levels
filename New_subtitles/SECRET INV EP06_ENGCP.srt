1
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:08,417
This is the promise.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,583
While you work to keep my home safe,

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,333
<i>Carol Danvers and I
will find you a new one.</i>

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,958
<i>You're tellin' me there's a million
Skrulls walking amongst us right now?</i>

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:28,125
<i>We need a single commander
whose war power is total and unchecked.</i>

6
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:32,375
<i>Therefore, I nominate Gravik
to the post of Skrull General.</i>

7
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:36,417
<i>Would you have loved me
if I'd never changed?</i>

8
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:39,250
<i>If I'd been my true self?</i>

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,000
You had another chance to kill Fury today,
and you didn't take it.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,292
<i>What DNA did Gravik steal?</i>

11
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,583
<i>Only a few samples.</i>

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,708
<i>But he took those because
he couldn't find what he was looking for.</i>

13
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:56,958
What was he looking for?

14
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,875
Something he called "the Harvest."

15
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,250
I got a deal for you.

16
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,292
Bring it to me in person,
I'll call the whole thing off.

17
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,042
And bring some iodide pills.

18
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,542
The reactor room
can be a touch aggressive.

19
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,208
This is the first time
you called this number in years.

20
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:37,958
I have dialed this number a million times.

21
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:41,583
This is just the first time
I pressed send.

22
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,500
Oh.
Well, that's cold consolation.

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,458
<i>You sound far away. Are you?</i>

24
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:53,750
Far enough to where it makes sense
to keep going the way I'm going.

25
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,500
Know if you'll be coming back?

26
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:03,500
Um, I'll, uh... I'll let you go now.

27
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,042
You don't have to,
if you don't want to, darling.

28
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:11,792
Take care of yourself.

29
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:23,208
<i>Mr. President,
we need to stay focused</i>

30
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:26,333
on honing your response
to the attack on your motorcade.

31
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,500
Respectfully, we still need time

32
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,292
to confirm that this was in fact
an official Russian act.

33
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,708
President Vladimov
has strenuously denied responsibility.

34
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,112
Oh, he's "strenuously denied it."

35
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,958
Then I guess we're all right then.

36
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:40,208
President Vladimov is a bald-faced liar

37
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:42,917
and I've got 30 dead Russians
on a motorway to prove it.

38
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,042
We cannot rule out the possibility
of a false flag attack.

39
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,250
Did you take a stupid pill
with your breakfast this morning, Admiral?

40
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,875
What happened on that motorway
was an all-out assault on our republic,

41
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,000
orchestrated by the Skrulls
and the Russians

42
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,833
who are giving them safe haven.

43
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:59,875
Our commander-in-chief
is still nursing internal injuries

44
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,458
from an assassination attempt

45
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,958
that he barely survived
by the skin of his teeth.

46
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:05,833
So, unless you have some actual evidence

47
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:08,875
to back up this ridiculous
false flag proposition,

48
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,583
I suggest you move on to doing
what it is you were summoned here to do,

49
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,958
which is present
the President of the United States

50
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:18,625
with his options
for a military response to Russia.

51
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,583
Put it on the monitor.

52
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,167
What are we looking at here,
Colonel Rhodes?

53
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,250
Real time satellite imagery, sir,

54
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:39,833
this is the Russian tanks taking positions
on the Finland and Ukrainian borders.

55
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:41,375
Now, sir, if I may,

56
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,833
I've taken the liberty

57
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:45,958
to prepare a rough copy
of your remarks to the nation.

58
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,542
The American people
need to hear from you, sir.

59
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,792
They need your leadership.

60
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,542
They need to understand
who's responsible for this.

61
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,833
And it's the Russians, 100%.

62
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,750
There's your proof right there.

63
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,208
Make the call, Mr. President.

64
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,167
Hello?

65
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,833
<i>- You have to get him out of there.</i>
- Who?

66
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,667
<i>The President, you bloody idiot.</i>

67
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,417
<i>Fury's headed straight for you.</i>

68
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,125
Fury? Why are we concerned about Fury?
We got enough security for him.

69
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,708
<i>For what? Target practice? Fury's lost it.</i>

70
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:35,042
<i>He wants Ritson stopped
before the bomb is launched.</i>

71
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,792
<i>Move the President now.</i>

72
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,083
Where is everybody?

73
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:10,833
Locked away.

74
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,875
Looks like it's just you and me, Fury.

75
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,875
All out of pills?
That's a shame, ain't it?

76
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,208
No more protection for you.
How about a drink instead?

77
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,417
Yeah, I wouldn't say no.

78
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Here.

79
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,250
There you go.

80
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,250
To the last stand of the great Nick Fury.

81
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Rhodey, what are you...

82
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,542
We're taking you to safety, Mr. President.

83
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,833
Hey. We're moving the President upstairs.

84
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,542
- What about the others?
- Clear!

85
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,225
- Tell 'em to start hunting.
- Copy that.

86
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,750
<i>Sweep every floor.
Lock down the elevators.</i>

87
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,333
<i>National security threat.</i>

88
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,583
Bet you never would've thought
your last 20 minutes on Earth

89
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,250
would be spent down here,
having a drink with me.

90
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,625
You see these tremors?

91
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,833
They're natural at this level of exposure.

92
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,500
It's once the shaking
gets above the elbow,

93
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,208
close to the heart,
that's when you need to be concerned.

94
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:20,292
I look concerned?

95
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,750
Of course without the pills,
the symptoms are gonna accelerate.

96
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:28,708
Fury, tell me you got a backup plan.
Your little Avengers on standby?

97
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,208
What about
that invisible cloak and shield?

98
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:38,708
You're too busy playing dress-up,
using my skin like a costume.

99
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:41,292
A costume, Fury?
Do you not recognize this skin?

100
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,667
Huh? This face.

101
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:48,042
This was the first human I killed.

102
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,833
And you know why I killed him?

103
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,042
I killed him because you told me to.

104
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,417
Oh, wow.

105
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:57,542
You don't even remember.

106
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,542
The first mission you sent me on.

107
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,417
You know, I was young. I tried my best.

108
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,375
I wanted to give everything
to impress my hero.

109
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,375
You know, the one who promised us a home.

110
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,708
But this man...

111
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:18,750
This man, Fury, he had a wife.
And he had children.

112
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,500
Yeah, all right,
maybe he was a bit misguided.

113
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,250
But I killed him because of you.

114
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,000
I killed him and I killed so many more.

115
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,917
And everyone I killed
took a little piece out of my heart.

116
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,125
- Well, you're not the only one.
- No.

117
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,875
But I am the only one
brave enough to admit it.

118
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,000
Talos was weak.

119
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:46,500
And we wandered in the shadows
for 30 years because he was weak.

120
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:50,292
He turned a war people
into a band of beggars and what,

121
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,417
I'm supposed to emulate that?

122
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:56,333
I'm supposed to be like Talos
and put my trust in you?

123
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,917
You pimped us, Fury.

124
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,583
You put us out to work for you

125
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,833
and when you were done with us,
you threw us away.

126
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:05,375
So, first, I'm gonna kill you.

127
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,250
And then I'm gonna take
a flamethrower to humanity.

128
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,583
And just so I am absolutely clear
about this, Fury...

129
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,292
You look at me. Look at me.

130
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,875
You did this.

131
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,125
All the bombs and the blackouts

132
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,542
and the massacres and the wildfires

133
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:26,583
and the imminent removal of humans
from their habitat, that is all you!

134
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:31,583
The species you spent
your entire adult life defending,

135
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,833
they were condemned to die

136
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,583
the day I realized
you weren't a man of your word.

137
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:41,958
You know, Fury,
you really should've kept your promise.

138
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,958
You're... You're right.

139
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:48,292
You're right, I failed you.

140
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,125
I failed you.

141
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,208
I knew within a few years of searching

142
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:57,208
that there was no other planet
out there for you.

143
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,167
I knew the only way
for me to keep my end of the bargain

144
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,875
was to build you a home here.

145
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,500
Why didn't you do it?

146
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:13,917
Because it's easier to save the lives
of eight billion people

147
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,542
than it is to change
their hearts and minds.

148
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,000
Even for Nick Fury?

149
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,958
Even for Nick Fury.

150
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,750
And then The Blip came.

151
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
You know,

152
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:43,292
the last thing I felt before I flaked off?

153
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,167
What's that?

154
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,125
Relief.

155
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,833
Relief that I didn't have
to fight anymore.

156
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,875
That I finally had a way out.

157
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,042
<i>- But you're right...</i>
- Clear the floor.

158
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,625
- Move! Move!
- Clear the floor.

159
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,833
Agent, your weapon.

160
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,333
<i>I wasn't brave.</i>

161
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,375
Agent Cannon, floor three, status?

162
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,458
Agent Cannon?

163
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:13,250
<i>Do you know why
I came back to Earth?</i>

164
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,375
You.

165
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,667
You were the youngest Skrull on my team.

166
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,667
I felt responsible for you.

167
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,792
Agent Johns, floor two, code four.

168
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,708
<i>I should have taught you
that you never give up the fight.</i>

169
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:32,167
Move.

170
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,000
<i>Because I failed you,</i>

171
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,875
<i>and failed your people,</i>

172
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:42,792
I've decided to give you what you want.

173
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:45,625
Is that what I think it is?

174
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:48,917
Carol Danvers' DNA.

175
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:54,875
Along with the Avengers',
that you and your team collected.

176
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,167
The Harvest.

177
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:03,542
In exchange for what?

178
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,250
That you take it, take your powers,

179
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:10,167
go to some other planet,
wipe out some other species,

180
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,417
I don't give a damn.

181
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,625
Just leave Earth the hell alone.
And leave it now.

182
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,667
Call off the strike and save your people.

183
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:23,542
Oh...

184
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,500
Oh, Fury.

185
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,500
I think the radiation
is eating your brains, mate.

186
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,333
- Watch that door.
- Yes, sir.

187
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,250
I need a gun.
Give me your gun, God damn it.

188
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:57,292
It's pure.

189
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,750
You really wanna die.

190
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,750
Okay, we can move him in here.

191
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,792
No checking behind the doors?
You really are a Skrull.

192
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,375
Whatever it is you think
you're doing, but...

193
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,125
No buts.
Just yours back into the hallway. Go on.

194
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,875
What the hell?

195
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:33,708
You.

196
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,458
You might wanna aim that gun
to your left, sir.

197
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:50,458
Shoot him right now, Mr. President.

198
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:54,042
I'm not here to hurt you, sir. But he is.

199
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,292
Rhodey?

200
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,625
You killed my mother. My father.

201
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,542
You're flailing. You're weak.

202
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,667
He is a Skrull.

203
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,042
And if you don't call off the strike,

204
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,292
you're going to kill the man
he's replicating

205
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,792
along with some
of the world's greatest minds.

206
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,667
Wait. What?

207
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,208
Skrull rebels have kidnapped
dozens of world officials.

208
00:19:58,042 --> 00:20:00,167
Along with Colonel Rhodes.

209
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,417
He and other world officials

210
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,000
are being kept in pods
beneath the Skrull compound.

211
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,833
You nuke that, you nuke them.

212
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,417
Please tell me this isn't true.

213
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Are you listening to this insanity?
Of course it isn't true.

214
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,292
Mr. President, listen.

215
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:37,333
Just stay the course, all right?
And all our enemies will be gone.

216
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,458
Yeah.

217
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,812
Mr. President, listen to me...

218
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,583
Sir, you're looking at your enemy.

219
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:59,417
You wait another minute,
he and the rebel Skrulls will win.

220
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:35,792
Sleep.

221
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,625
For Christ's sake, Ritson,
what have you got to lose?

222
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,792
She's right.
Just delay the strike.

223
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:55,250
If I'm wrong, you can send me
to prison and flatten Russia.

224
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,625
You're just like your father.

225
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:29,333
Just like them.

226
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,208
Jesus,
somebody give me the phone.

227
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,125
Colonel Rhodes?

228
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:54,625
How long have you been in here?

229
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:58,500
Whoa! Colonel Rhodes, I've got you.

230
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,583
You've been held hostage
for a long time.

231
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,708
<i>We all witnessed the terror attack</i>

232
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:41,250
<i>that was carried out on my motorcade
earlier this week in England.</i>

233
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,125
<i>The terrorists responsible</i>

234
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:47,000
<i>were a shape-shifting alien-born species
known as Skrulls.</i>

235
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,958
{\an8}That is why tonight
I'm presenting to Congress,

236
00:24:50,042 --> 00:24:51,708
{\an8}for immediate emergency authorization,

237
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:55,833
{\an8}a bill that designates all off-world born
species enemy combatants.

238
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,125
We know who you are.
We know how to find you.

239
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,417
And we will kill every last one of you.

240
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:19,042
Love what you've done with the place.

241
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:24,458
I'm sorry.

242
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
For what?

243
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,333
Not being here.

244
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:31,083
I can take care of myself.

245
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:34,375
I know that. But you shouldn't have to.

246
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:39,333
I... I know who I am when you're not here.

247
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,292
It's when you come back

248
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,833
that I start to wonder...

249
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,417
Did you fall in love with me?

250
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,750
Or the face that puts you at ease?

251
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:57,792
I love you, Priscilla.

252
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:02,875
I'm here to ask you for one last chance.

253
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,542
I'm leaving tonight.

254
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:09,208
Then I guess this is goodbye.

255
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:19,708
If you can find a way to forgive me,
you know where to find me.

256
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:44,583
We meet at last.

257
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,083
Unless you have an army
crammed in the back of that car,

258
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,768
I advise you to go back the way you came.

259
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:53,500
Oh, I haven't come for fight, G'iah.

260
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:57,417
With your special abilities,
it would be a lopsided affair.

261
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,333
Who are you?

262
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,292
A friend of a friend.
Your people need a leader.

263
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:07,000
You'll need resources to fight this war
that Ritson has launched on your people

264
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,250
and I can get them to you.

265
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:11,125
And let me guess, you're doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

266
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,917
Oh, God, no, don't be silly.

267
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,833
My father entered into a deal like that.
It didn't end so well.

268
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:20,000
Yes, let's be sure not to repeat
the mistakes of Talos and Fury

269
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,917
and leave love and friendship out of this.

270
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,917
I will use you and you will use me

271
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,250
and together we'll make this planet safe
for both our people.

272
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,542
I was relieved that we made it out alive.

273
00:27:58,625 --> 00:27:59,917
<i>I was relieved, too.</i>

274
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,833
Until I watched
that hateful-ass speech you made.

275
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:08,167
<i>Putting things back together
was never gonna be easy.</i>

276
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,583
What the hell is all this?

277
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:13,708
This is how the enemy got so good.

278
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:21,042
<i>You took a bad situation
and made it worse.</i>

279
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:24,042
<i>That's real one-term-President stuff.</i>

280
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,375
<i>But we have to act now.</i>

281
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,458
<i>Before the hit squads you inspired</i>

282
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,583
<i>kill off the Skrulls
who still wanna help us.</i>

283
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:41,000
<i>Now you've got dumbass vigilantes
killing innocent humans, too.</i>

284
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,917
<i>When they're not getting
killed themselves.</i>

285
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,625
<i>Call off your war.</i>

286
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:56,000
<i>Give me a break.
There's only one way this ends.</i>

287
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,000
<i>The old Nick Fury would have known that.</i>

288
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:02,750
And if you truly care about the Skrulls,
get 'em off my planet.

289
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:35,375
Hold a minute.

290
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:07,542
Sounds like peace, doesn't it?

291
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:10,042
Yeah. That's all I want.

292
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,875
- Priscilla...
- Varra.

293
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:20,000
Now that humans know we're among them,
I'd like to use my birth name.

294
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,208
Well, Varra. Good news from S.A.B.E.R.

295
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:29,417
The Kree said they are open to peace talks
with the Skrulls.

296
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:31,875
The Kree make peace.

297
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,792
Reminds me of that old joke.

298
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,833
What do Skrulls call good luck?

299
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,083
Bad luck.

300
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:42,500
Stop it. It's a good thing.

301
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,083
- I need your help.
- My help?

302
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:48,958
Yeah, with this, you know,
this peace summit.

303
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:54,292
You're the best diplomat
the Skrulls have ever had.

304
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,375
I'm no good with people. You are.

305
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:00,417
- You've got your own way.
- Yeah, well, I'm sick of it.

306
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,583
And we're better together.

307
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:05,292
Well, at least, I am.

308
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:11,208
Please, come with me.

309
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,083
I'll help you get started.

310
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:23,792
But then I've gotta get back.

311
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,500
All my work is here, darling.

312
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:28,750
And it's never been more important.

313
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,292
I just wanted to tell you that...

314
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:46,833
That I love you.

315
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,958
As I am.

316
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:59,042
Only as you are.
