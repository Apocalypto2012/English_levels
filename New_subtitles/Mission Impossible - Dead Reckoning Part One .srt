The Patkova stealth capability..

14
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,641

You made the right choice.

126
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,156
Sir.

127
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:06,497
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

128
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:09,528
It's been a long time.

129
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:13,709
Our lives are the sum of our choices.

130
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,887
And we cannot escape the past.

131
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:20,484
30 years ago, you
were offered two choices.

132
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:24,337
Join the IMF or spend your life in prison.

133
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:29,800
Because of your unique natural talents,
your government forgave you.

134
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:32,355
But we will never forget.

135
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,218
Just as you will never forget the death

136
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:38,040
that brought you to us all those years ago.

137
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:56,769
This is to remind you of
your oath and allegiance to us.

138
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:00,234
The stakes of this mission
are higher than ever.

139
00:10:01,348 --> 00:10:03,698
Your habitual rope
behavior will not be tolerated.

140
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:08,621
Should you choose to accept
it is imperative that you listen.

141
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:11,876
Your government is searching for a key.

142
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,662
Its purpose, its vital importance to us,

143
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:17,549
is none of your concern.

144
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,875
What should concern you is the
involvement of your friend Ilsa Faust.

145
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:26,833
She killed a courier in Istanbul.

146
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:31,365
and we believe he was carrying
one half of the key we're searching for.

147
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:35,700
Why she has chosen to
interfere in this affair is a mystery.

148
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,286
as are her whereabouts.

149
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:43,593
What is certain is that your
government has put a price on her head.

150
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:48,333
And these bounty
hunters are out to collect it.

151
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,889
They never bring a fugitive back to life.

152
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:54,555
And rarely in one piece.

153
00:10:55,937 --> 00:10:58,709
We believe they're headed for
the Arabian desert's empty quarter

154
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:00,105

155
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,731
Find the bounty hunters
and you may just find her.

156
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:07,925
Your mission should you choose to accept it

157
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:11,261
is to acquire the key and deliver it to us.

158
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,457
What happens to Ilsa
after that is up to you.

159
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,494
As always if any members of
your team are caught or killed

160
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:23,112
the secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.

00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:27,744

destruct in five seconds.

information with which it comes in contact.

Once infected nothing recorded, stored or
transmitted digitally can be trusted as fact.

170
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:01,581
At the outset it concentrated
primarily on news and social media

171
00:16:01,914 --> 00:16:05,167
which was of little concern to
us as it often suited our purposes

172
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:07,394

Intelligence directorate.

174

10,000 fold overnight,

177
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:20,242
spreading exponentially.

178
00:16:20,676 --> 00:16:24,529
Indicating that the entity
has since become sentient.

179
00:16:26,181 --> 00:16:28,060
You're telling me this
thing has a mind of its own?

180
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:30,810
Over the last three weeks
alone it has accessed

181
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:33,671
our satellite telecommunications,
the Federal Reserve,

182
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:36,386
the stock market and
the national power grid.

183
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,439
The FAA, NASA and the
combined branches of our military.

184
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:40,986
And we're not alone.

185
00:16:41,342 --> 00:16:44,214
It has penetrated the world
and European central banks.

186
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,735
It has led you to the major defense,
finance and infrastructure systems

187
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:51,561
of Russia, India, Israel,
Australia, all of Europe.

188
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:54,937
And what did it do to all
of these systems exactly?

189
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,375
Nothing.

190
00:16:57,657 --> 00:16:58,291
Nothing?

191
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,028
It came and it went.

192
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:02,666
Leaving fingerprints where
they could easily be found

193
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:05,330
and sending a very clear message.

194
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:08,719
I shall return.

195
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:12,347
Whatever its ultimate goal
is, we're powerless to stop it.

196
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:16,585
The full force of its energy is
now directed at a single objective.

197
00:17:17,064 --> 00:17:18,533
The world's intelligence networks.

198
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:20,880
The very truth as we know it.

199
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,877
The entire intelligence
community is racing to archive

200
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,930
hard copies of our fact
positive knowledge bases

201
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:31,757
before our most secure data
centers are breached and corrupted.

202
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:33,518
Which is only a matter of time.

203
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:37,341
The entity will know precisely
how to undermine our every strength

204
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,568
and exploit our every weakness.

205
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:41,829
How to turn our allies into enemies.

206
00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:45,434
And our enemies into aggressors.

207
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:47,962
Why not air gap our intelligence services?

208
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,320
Cut them off from the
outside world entirely.

209
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:51,904
We already have.

210
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:55,656
But servers require
humans to maintain them.

211
00:17:55,998 --> 00:17:58,413
And humans are the weakest
link in any security chain

212
00:17:58,985 --> 00:18:02,707
especially when dealing with a
godless, stateless, amoral enemy.

213
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:06,551
One that has been patiently
listening, reading, watching.

214
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:10,133
Harvesting our deepest
personal secrets for years.

215
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:14,715
Able to be guile, blackmail,
bribe, or be anyone at once.

216
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:18,965
And to manipulate us at will
through our total dependence

217
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:21,705
on a carefully constructed digital reality.

218
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,062
An enemy that is everywhere.

219
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:26,581
And nowhere.

220
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:28,761
And has no center.

221
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,260
Arr.

222
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:36,297
So what you're telling me is

223
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:40,485
the most awesome god damn intelligence
and tactical apparatus on the planet

224
00:18:41,528 --> 00:18:43,781
has no way of killing this thing.

225
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,342
You don't want to kill it, sir.

226
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:49,704
You want to control.

227
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:52,297
And how do we do that?
- Mr. Kittridge.

228
00:18:54,204 --> 00:18:57,344
CIA's assets in the Kremlin
informed us that the Russians

229
00:18:57,976 --> 00:19:01,057
have focused the majority
of their intelligence activity

230
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:04,227
on acquiring two halves
of the cruciform key.

231
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:08,050
And what does it unlock?
- I'm not exactly sure.

232
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,936
But the Russians seem to believe
that it somehow has the power

233
00:19:12,229 --> 00:19:13,959
to deactivate our mysterious entity.

234
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,610
Though, ideally.

235
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,477
They hope to control it.

236
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:20,189
Harness.

237
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:22,188
Do you believe that, Kittridge?

238
00:19:23,515 --> 00:19:26,432
What matters is that the rest of world believes it.

239
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:30,881
Japan, India, Germany,
and the Brits didn't get no one not

240
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:37,076
not even closest allies have willingly
whispered one word of it to us,

241
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:41,741
which would indicate that there's a global
race on to acquire the two halves of this key.

242
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:47,328
Every nation in it before themselves,
not to kill this thing, sir,

243
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:52,528
but to weaponize it and in so doing establish a new,

244
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:55,779
incontestable form of global dominance.

245
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:57,773
How do we find this key first?

246
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:00,681
Well, we know that a
buyer is passing somewhere

247
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:03,767
through the Middle East
sometime in the next 72 hours.

248
00:20:04,492 --> 00:20:07,402
We believe that he already
has one half of this key.

249
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:09,488
You believe?
- Well, at this point,

250
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:11,161
we can't be certain
it's not a counterfeit.

251
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:12,494
How would you verify that?

252
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:15,620
The only thing that can authenticate
one genuine half of the key

253
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,995
is the other genuine half of the key.

254
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:21,447
It's true mate, if you will.
We think it's some sort of fail-safe.

255
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,186
How do we find its main?

256
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:26,187
Well, we believe the other
genuine half of the key

257
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:27,900
was in the hands of this woman.

258
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:33,085
Who is she? - Ilse Faust.
-  Former British intelligence.

259
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:35,668
Where is she now?
- She's dead, sir.

260
00:20:36,354 --> 00:20:39,609
She was, excuse me, killed by mercenaries

261
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:42,758
looking to collect a bounty.
- And who put up the bounty?

262
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:45,481
Given her body of work,
could it have been anyone?

263
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,578
So any one could have her half of the key?

264
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:49,945
Not just anyone.

265
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:53,056
I sent a man to find her.

266
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:56,398
The only man that she would have
entrusted with her half of the key.

267
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:57,782
Oh, does he have it, Kittredge?

268
00:20:58,171 --> 00:21:01,857
Well, at present, I don't know that, sir.
He's... refused to come in.

269
00:21:03,018 --> 00:21:03,808
Refused?

270
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:07,424
Who the hell is this guy?
- That's classified.

271
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,690
I'm the goddamn director
of natural intelligence.

272
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,097
What exactly is it I'm not
supposed to know about?

273
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:15,732
The IMF. - Mr. Kittredge
- The World Bank.

274
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:18,099
No, that's the International
Monetary Fund. - Mr. Kittredge?

275
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,513
I mean the other IMF, ours.

276
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:22,240
What does it stand for?

277
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:24,884
Impossible mission force.

278
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,847
You're not serious.
- I'm afraid he is.

279
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:32,696
And what do they do exactly?
- It's just as the name implies.

280
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:34,309
Whatever the rest of us can't.

281
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:37,485
And who's in charge? - They're not
ones to take orders in the traditional sense.

282
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,001
We more or less...

283
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:42,736
Leave word.

284
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,969
Leave word.
- Mr. Kittredge.

285
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,763
The IMF operates outside the community
and answers directly to the president.

286
00:21:51,322 --> 00:21:52,234
So let me get this straight.

287
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:55,384
When there's a mission,
none of you can handle.

288
00:21:57,031 --> 00:21:59,966
You just leave word for a nameless man

289
00:22:01,344 --> 00:22:02,727
and hope he gets the job done.

290
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:04,808
Is that it?

291
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:07,317
Should we choose to accept it?

292
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:10,857
What the hell kind of outfit ..
it's to choose what orders to accept.

293
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:15,726
The IMF was expressed and created to ensure
that with no unintended consequences,

294
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:19,342
that they cannot ensure the
mission's ultimate outcome.

295
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,719
They're authorized to decline.

296
00:23:14,014 --> 00:23:14,881
I understand.

297
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,183
You're upset.
- I'm not upset, Kittredge.

298
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:22,376
You want to be to listen.

299
00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:26,283
This is me listening.

300
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:29,416
All right.

301
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:34,033
I put the bounty on Bilse's head.
I also told you how to find her.

302
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:38,904
And I didn't ask her to steal the key.
She did that for reasons of her own.

303
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,010
But that's the pattern, isn't it?

304
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:49,300
You get her out of trouble
and she always found her way back in.

305
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:00,924
Wait!

306
00:24:01,713 --> 00:24:03,964
It's me!

307
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:05,968
It's me.

308
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:14,014
Okay.

309
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,935
Listen to me, You're dead!
You stay dead!

310
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,007
Keep away!

311
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:58,694
I'm not gonna apologize to you, Hant.

312
00:24:59,513 --> 00:25:00,812
It's my job to use you.

313
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,110
Just like it's your job to be of use.

314
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,373
Did you accomplish your mission or not?

315
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:14,529
Wherever the other half of this is,

316
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:17,573
whatever the completed key unlocks,

317
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,365
I will find it.

318
00:25:21,796 --> 00:25:22,967
And then what?

319
00:25:23,954 --> 00:25:26,647
No one should be trusted
with control of the entity.

320
00:25:28,422 --> 00:25:30,259
I mean to kill it.
- Ethen.

321
00:25:31,408 --> 00:25:34,701
The next world war isn't going to be a
cold one, it's going to be a shooting war,

322
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:38,321
it's going to be a ballistic war
over a rapidly shrinking ecosystem,

323
00:25:38,783 --> 00:25:41,120
it's going to be a war for the
last of our dwindling energy,

324
00:25:41,497 --> 00:25:43,292
drinkable water, breathable air.

325
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:47,506
Whoever controls the
entity controls the truth.

326
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:51,418
The concepts of right and wrong

327
00:25:51,937 --> 00:25:55,378
can be clearly defined for
everyone for centuries to come.

328
00:25:56,315 --> 00:25:57,873
Do you even hear yourself?

329
00:25:58,846 --> 00:26:02,622
The days of fighting for
the so-called greater good

330
00:26:04,252 --> 00:26:05,073
are over.

331
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:07,682
You need to pick a side.

332
00:26:09,092 --> 00:26:10,848
We're on the same side as always, man.

333
00:26:13,277 --> 00:26:14,349
Stay out of my way.

334
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,551
I can't do that.

335
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:21,136
15 minutes ago. I understand.
Thank you. - Are you able to speak freely?

336
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:24,486
No thank you. - The security
team is on the way

337
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:27,716
If you're in any danger,
simply hang up before I count to 5.

338
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,861
One, two..

339
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,047
So how do you plan to get out of here?

340
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,470
Of course.

341
00:27:37,142 --> 00:27:39,612

against his country is
missing and has malfunctioned.

and he must be neutralized at all costs.

348
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,413
Anything of this man's
possession is of vital importance.

349
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:10,516
It must be captured intact.

350
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,945
The man himself is expendable.

351
00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:15,380
He is not to be underestimated.

352
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:20,377
A master of infiltration, deception,
sabotage, and psych warfare.

353
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,651
For all intents and purposes,
ladies and gentlemen,

354
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:25,873
a migrating shapeshifting
incarnation of chaos.

355
00:28:26,553 --> 00:28:32,343
So, for your safety and the safety of those
around you, do not consider him secure

356
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:35,951
unless you have driven a wooden
stake through his open arms.

357
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:38,445
This is not a drill.

358
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:41,810
Self-aware,

359
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:43,476
self-learning,

360
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:46,205
truth-eating digital parasite,

361
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:49,462
infesting all of cyberspace.

362
00:28:51,711 --> 00:28:53,143
Well, it was bound to
happen sooner or later.

363
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:55,053
and the two halves of this key

364
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:57,752
just might provide the means of
controlling this ...

365
00:28:58,906 --> 00:28:59,647
entity.

366
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:02,986
Meaning every government on the
planet would kill us just to get that key.

367
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:05,838
Including our own.
- Exactly.

368
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,476
Putting us on an unsanctioned mission which
has gone rogue before it even started.

369
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:15,631
Meaning this very conversation
is technically an act of treason.

370
00:29:16,082 --> 00:29:18,671
Or as we like to call it, Monday.

371
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:22,286
So what's the play?

372
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:26,496
A buyer is coming in on Flight 746
from Amsterdam for a 30-minute layover,

373
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:30,022
at which time he is hoping to
purchase that half of the key.

374
00:29:30,396 --> 00:29:32,689
And it stands to reason
the buyer will have the

375
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:34,724
other half of the key
somewhere on that person.

376
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,945
Being the only way to
authenticate our half.

377
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,781
So how do we identify the buyer?

378
00:29:40,152 --> 00:29:43,377
This Geiger counter will detect the radiological
signature of the dragon's egg

379
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,747
invented in the buyer's key.

380
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:47,026
The augmented reality overly
in these glasses ...

381
00:29:48,146 --> 00:29:49,091
will lead us to it.

382
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:52,619
Oh, that's very clever.

383
00:29:53,188 --> 00:29:54,906
So, do you ID the buyer?

384
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,137
Pick his pockets of your ankle?

385
00:29:57,284 --> 00:29:57,798
No.

386
00:29:59,097 --> 00:29:59,649
Because of

387
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:02,270
The complete key is of no value
if we don't know where it unlocks.

388
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:06,016
So, you're going to sell the
buyer a whole half of the key?

389
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:10,495
while we figure out the buyer's connecting
flight and book a USC on that plane.

390
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,732
So you can follow the key wherever it goes.

391
00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:17,131
which you hope is into the hands of
someone who knows what it unlocks.

392
00:30:17,522 --> 00:30:18,225
Precisely.

393
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:19,764
Finding the complete key.

394
00:30:21,681 --> 00:30:22,543
Tell me the beginning.

395
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:27,169
The fate of the world depends
on finding whatever it unlocks.

396
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:32,135
The sky!

397
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:33,607
No!

398
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,847
Not personally!

399
00:30:36,731 --> 00:30:38,004
But it is personally!

400
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:17,159
Hey, what's that?
- What?

401
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:20,012
Security alert, suspicious bag on its way to Venice.

402
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,864
Nope it's gone, it must have been
a false alarm.

403
00:31:31,946 --> 00:31:33,812
Overwatch snapshot.
Where's he at?

404
00:31:38,222 --> 00:31:39,545
Snapshot.
Overwatch I have him.

405
00:31:40,043 --> 00:31:41,751
Terminal B gave 15 at its stop.

406
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:46,346
I am so?
- You are not.

407
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:50,181
Ethan, would you care to explain
to our friend the Net Ranger?

408
00:31:50,568 --> 00:31:53,325
How I am just as capable of
writing code as he is. - No comment.

409
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:55,539
Oh, what you figured at
Phineas Freak here is going

410
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,620
to single-handedly work
out a way to kill the entity.

411
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,060
Will I just hold this in the sulk
ring I am? - Probably. - Definitely.

412
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:08,776
Tell me where he is. Where he is?
- Blue suit, right in front of you.

413
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:21,658
What the fuck are you doing?

414
00:32:22,162 --> 00:32:23,312
What are you doing here?

415
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,194
You're fucking crazy.

416
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:29,076
What are you doing here?

417
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:30,581
You're crazy.

418
00:32:31,551 --> 00:32:32,437
Are you crazy?

419
00:32:34,007 --> 00:32:34,735
What are you doing here?

420
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:35,865
You're fucking crazy.

421
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:36,870
It's him.

422
00:32:37,183 --> 00:32:37,860
I'm telling you, it's not him.

423
00:32:38,192 --> 00:32:40,775
And I'm telling you, facial
comes back with a perfect fit.

424
00:32:45,725 --> 00:32:49,140
How did you do that?
- No one is safe from Phineas Freak.

425
00:32:58,054 --> 00:33:00,988
Hey, God. Where is he?
- Terminal E gate five.

426
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:03,359
God damn it, that's clear on
the other side of the airport.

427
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:04,890
What the fuck was that?

428
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:11,716
If in their head to Terminal E,
that side of the airport is all yours.

429
00:33:12,696 --> 00:33:14,235
Thank you, Luther.
- I see the buyer.

430
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:17,904
Got him. The buyer is
Otto von Bork, Swiss National.

431
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:22,260
He's connecting to Venice, departing
in 30 minutes from flight 1031.

432
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:26,819
Benji, give me on that flight to Venice.
- Yep, flight 1031 to Venice. Stand by.

433
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:39,431
What?

434
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:42,176
Ethan, what just happened?
- He was bomped.

435
00:33:42,544 --> 00:33:44,129
Bomped?!
What do you mean, bomped.?

436
00:33:44,641 --> 00:33:47,610
The woman picked his pocket.
Tag her. Tell me who she is.

437
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,842
1031 Venice.

438
00:33:56,975 --> 00:33:58,073
Luther, meet our comms.

439
00:33:58,989 --> 00:34:01,095
What is it?
- That bag was on its way to flight 1031.

440
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:01,994
What bag?

441
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,650
It was a suspicious bag in there.

442
00:34:04,174 --> 00:34:05,637
A few minutes ago.
- So what about it?

443
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:08,311
It was on its way to flight 1031 to Venice.

444
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:10,687
It's the buyer's plane.
It's Ethan's plane.

445
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:12,946
Luther, do you copy?
Who is she?

446
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:14,842
Well, it wasn't a false alarm.

447
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,247
What if somebody is trying to
smuggle a bomb onto that plane?

448
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,865
And what if that's what
the entity wants us to think?

449
00:34:20,204 --> 00:34:21,253
To keep even off that plane?

450
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:23,164
Luther, what's happening?
- Should we bomb it?

451
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:25,678
No.
- Guys, guys, you hear me?

452
00:34:25,962 --> 00:34:28,139
Find that bag.
I'll direct you. Go.

453
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:30,944
Luther, tell me, is there something wrong?

454
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,455
Nothing to worry about.
It's under control.

455
00:34:34,897 --> 00:34:35,652
Gather.

456
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,729
Info on the woman is coming now.

457
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,577
Oh, whoever she is, she's no spy.

458
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:46,433
She's a thief.

459
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:48,367
Where are we going, Luther?

460
00:34:48,892 --> 00:34:50,766
Benji, there's a door
on your immediate left.

461
00:34:51,686 --> 00:34:52,767
I'm unlocking it now.

462
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:59,918
The bag you're after is on tray 01833.

463
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,417
Heading towards the
northwest corner of the facility.

464
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:03,967
Copy that.

465
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:15,760
Hi.

466
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,584
Hello.

467
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:24,883
Oh, I get it.

468
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:27,051
You thought I was someone else.

469
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:31,192
I'm most interested.

470
00:35:32,656 --> 00:35:33,681
Give me a chance.

471
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:35,978
I'll scream.

472
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:38,762
Please do.

473
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:43,255
What do you want?

474
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:45,186
This key.

475
00:35:47,415 --> 00:35:48,787
The one you picked from that man's pocket.

476
00:35:49,967 --> 00:35:52,370
It's worthless ..
without this key.

477
00:35:54,874 --> 00:35:55,940
But together,

478
00:35:56,495 --> 00:35:59,664
there was four million in cryptocurrency
that man was carrying around a flash drive.

479
00:36:02,153 --> 00:36:05,158
I wouldn't know anything about that.
- And why was this driving your pocket?

480
00:36:07,286 --> 00:36:10,102
Who are you?
- You working with someone?

481
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:13,007
Never, I'm strictly single now.

482
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:14,970
Today you got a partner.

483
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,798
The man you stole this from to complete a transaction

484
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:19,783
will lead this airport with both of these

485
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:22,846
without ever knowing his pocket was picked up
before your board's flight in ..

486
00:36:23,172 --> 00:36:24,814
Seven minutes
- Seven minutes.

487
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:27,735
You both know you're a good pickpocket.

488
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,333
Let's see what kind of pickpocket you are.

489
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:34,730
You expect me to push it back.

490
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:38,278
Oh, I know you will.
You're a thief.

491
00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:40,590
You want the money
and I can give it to you.

492
00:36:42,605 --> 00:36:45,722
Your choice.
You're in or you're out?

493
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,182
All right.
So what's the play?

494
00:36:51,516 --> 00:36:53,184
I sure hope you know what you're doing.

495
00:36:54,162 --> 00:36:55,063
After you.

496
00:36:57,714 --> 00:36:59,210
Oh, I won't be needing this.

497
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:01,183
I don't smoke.

498
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:03,204
Keep it.

499
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:05,469
Something you'll remember me by.

500
00:37:11,267 --> 00:37:14,861
Ethan, the alloy in that key she
took off the buyer doesn't match.

501
00:37:15,403 --> 00:37:17,606
It's counterfeit.
- I expect nothing less.

502
00:37:18,255 --> 00:37:21,179
That doesn't change your objective.
The buyer has to leave with both keys.

503
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:25,043
Talk to me Luther. Where am I going?
- Benji, head down the stairs in front of you

504
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:26,573
and the bag should
be right there. - Okay.

505
00:37:27,532 --> 00:37:28,443
Come back, come back.

506
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:36,020
That's him.
Right in front of you.

507
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:39,902
Okay, okay
Hey, hey. Sorry,

508
00:37:40,187 --> 00:37:40,866
Sorry, thought you were somebody else.

509
00:37:43,438 --> 00:37:44,813
Runs jerk in our chain.

510
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:48,400
Everybody.
Two man teams spread out.

511
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:51,014
Ethan, our American
friends are getting wise.

512
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:53,528
They're breaking up and
canvassing the airport.

513
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:55,813
Keep your eyes peeled.
- So what do I call you?

514
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,714
How about Grace?
You? - Listen, Grace.

515
00:38:01,176 --> 00:38:02,786
You should know we're
not the only interested party.

516
00:38:03,121 --> 00:38:04,839
I tell you to run,
you run. - Run?

517
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:07,474
This is getting exciting.

518
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:10,848
Benji, have you got that bag?
- I'll find it, I'll find it.

519
00:38:25,295 --> 00:38:28,807
There's a cylindrical device inside.
I'm going to take it out.

520
00:38:33,553 --> 00:38:34,414
Now we're going through.

521
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:37,423
Ethan, the buyer is in the
waiting area above you.

522
00:38:37,737 --> 00:38:38,751
Top of the escalator.

523
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:42,864
All units are headed in your direction.

524
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:45,753
Your location is going to be
crawling with agents any time now.

525
00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:57,668
Whatever it is, I've just activated it.

526
00:39:00,364 --> 00:39:01,699
Looks like we have five minutes.

527
00:39:04,731 --> 00:39:06,505
Also, it appears to be nuclear.
- How big?

528
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:08,716
Big enough to matter to
everybody in this airport, I suspect.

529
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:09,870
Can you disarm it?

530
00:39:10,157 --> 00:39:12,207
Well, I haven't got any tools.
- Then find something.

531
00:39:12,522 --> 00:39:13,569
Well, where are we going to find...

532
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:38,924
Is this where we run?

533
00:39:40,274 --> 00:39:41,336
Not yet.

534
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:43,550
Benji, how are you doing with that bomb?

535
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:47,417
I got it!

536
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:51,209
It's a cylinder cypher, there's eight wheels.

537
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:53,769
Looks like 14 letters on each wheel.

538
00:39:54,107 --> 00:39:56,630
1.5 billion possible combinations.

539
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:00,251
Give or take.
Oh my God.

540
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:01,529
What now?

541
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:04,116
The wheels, they spell out a message.

542
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:07,951
You are done. - No way!
Not yet, we are.

543
00:40:09,246 --> 00:40:10,088
They're not D-O-N-E.

544
00:40:10,393 --> 00:40:12,020
D-U-N-N.

545
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:14,101
It's my last name.

546
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,902
It knows who I am.

547
00:40:33,135 --> 00:40:34,501
Hold on, there's a message on the display.

548
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,765
I speak without a mask.

549
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:39,644
I fly through the air without wings.
What am I?

550
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:41,450
You get me what?
- It's a riddle.

551
00:40:41,755 --> 00:40:43,368
I suspect this thing is voice-activated.

552
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:44,770
It wants me to say the answer.

553
00:40:45,373 --> 00:40:46,308
I fly through the air.

554
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,751
An echo.

555
00:40:48,982 --> 00:40:50,123
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.

556
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,547
Okay, a new message.

557
00:40:51,962 --> 00:40:53,837
Are you afraid of death?

558
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,644
What kind of a riddle is that?
- It's not a riddle.

559
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,286
It's a psychometric test.

560
00:40:59,218 --> 00:41:00,517
The more questions you answer,

561
00:41:01,447 --> 00:41:02,915
the more I don't know about you.

562
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:04,457
Are you afraid of death?
No.

563
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:08,144
Did it work?
- I lied.

564
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:10,355
It knows.
- Just tell it the truth.

565
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,589
Say it.

566
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:13,792
Are you afraid of death?
Yes, who isn't?

567
00:41:24,529 --> 00:41:26,883
Okay, what's always
approaching but never arrives?

568
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,221
Um... - Wait, wait,
wait. I know this one.

569
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:31,883
The clock is ticking, Luther.
- Riddle's on my thing, Benji.

570
00:41:32,176 --> 00:41:33,967
What more can I say?
- We're running out of time!

571
00:41:35,848 --> 00:41:36,666
There he is.

572
00:41:37,242 --> 00:41:39,889
This is too easy.
- Sorry to bother you, Ethan.

573
00:41:40,727 --> 00:41:42,761
What should happen to know
what's always approaching...

574
00:41:43,914 --> 00:41:44,986
but never arrives?

575
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:46,786
What's always approaching
but never arrives?

576
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:48,267
Tomorrow.

577
00:41:49,735 --> 00:41:51,805
What? - Always
approaching but never arrives.

578
00:41:52,637 --> 00:41:54,515
Tomorrow.
- It's tomorrow.

579
00:41:57,888 --> 00:41:59,695
Okay, next question...
- Do you want the goods?

580
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:02,987
I'll be watching.
- Why, you don't trust me?

581
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:10,192
Luther, what is happening?

582
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:13,677
Nothing to worry about.
Everything is under control.

583
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:14,789
Okay, next question...

584
00:42:15,092 --> 00:42:17,710
Who or what is the most
important thing to you?

585
00:42:18,817 --> 00:42:21,244
Say it. - I can...
- There's no other choice, say it.

586
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:26,033
My friends.
Bastard.

587
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:38,727
Is he here?
- Yes, he is.

588
00:42:39,571 --> 00:42:40,665
Give me the money, give me the key.

589
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:45,106
Okay, okay. What gets
bigger, the more you take away?

590
00:42:45,573 --> 00:42:47,110
A hole. - A hole!
Brilliant, brilliant!

591
00:42:59,634 --> 00:43:01,125
I've got no more questions
than there's one more wheel.

592
00:43:01,648 --> 00:43:03,468
How am I supposed to give
answers if I've got no questions?

593
00:43:03,858 --> 00:43:06,479
That must be your final test.
- I've got 45 seconds!

594
00:43:10,218 --> 00:43:12,940
What happens now?
- I'm thinking... Don't move.

595
00:43:13,908 --> 00:43:15,840
There's something down need
a way out of here. Where I'm go?

596
00:43:16,773 --> 00:43:17,695
We have a bigger problem, Ethan.

597
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,393
It's very possible no one is
getting out of here. - What?

598
00:43:20,752 --> 00:43:23,573
There's a bomb in Bagga
Chandler. A nuclear bomb.

599
00:43:23,998 --> 00:43:26,661
The question I asked you
is part of the code for disarmament.

600
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:27,753
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

601
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,495
Why didn't you tell me this?
- Wait, you had a lot going on.

602
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:34,036
We didn't want to bother you.
- Listen to me.

603
00:43:34,337 --> 00:43:36,814
A nuclear bomb is something
you bother me with immediately.

604
00:43:37,237 --> 00:43:38,439
How much time?
- 20 seconds.

605
00:43:39,794 --> 00:43:41,437
20 seconds?
- Wait, there's one more riddle.

606
00:43:41,729 --> 00:43:43,492
I'm working on it.
15 seconds. - Easy, easy.

607
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,110
What's the riddle? - In the time it takes
me to explain, we're all going to be dead.

608
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,645
Come on, Benji. - Why do we
always end up in these situations?

609
00:43:50,053 --> 00:43:50,932
10 seconds!

610
00:43:51,822 --> 00:43:52,968
nine... eight

611
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:55,040
seven... six

612
00:43:55,876 --> 00:43:57,917
five

613
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,813
GOOD LUCK!

614
00:44:07,974 --> 00:44:09,349
Oh my God.
- What is it?

615
00:44:11,653 --> 00:44:12,467
It's empty.

616
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,880
What do you mean empty?
- There's nothing inside.

617
00:44:21,195 --> 00:44:23,048
We should have the key.
- Which key? - Our key.

618
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,097
The real key. - What?
- Let's just find her.

619
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,073
Again, she's headed for Terminal E.

620
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:51,206
Okaybe
- What is it?

621
00:44:52,114 --> 00:44:53,522
Who's there, Benji?
- Abort Abort! Get out!

622
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:55,310
Where do we run, Devu?
- No, we don't.

623
00:44:55,798 --> 00:44:57,106
This mission is terminated.

624
00:44:57,733 --> 00:44:58,525
Get out now.

625
00:45:10,285 --> 00:45:12,203
Hunt!
Stop right there. Hey!

626
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:13,975
You see?
- You see where?

627
00:45:15,263 --> 00:45:16,359
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

628
00:45:16,824 --> 00:45:18,421
Sorry.
Sorry.

629
00:45:20,536 --> 00:45:21,204
<b>Rome.</b>

630
00:45:58,168 --> 00:45:59,146
Sorry, sorry.

631
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:41,912
It's gotta be here somewhere.

632
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,277
God damn it!

633
00:46:56,467 --> 00:46:58,395
What we have here is
shortwave radio.

634
00:46:58,846 --> 00:47:02,557
Magnetic audio recording
cathode ray tube monitors.

635
00:47:03,798 --> 00:47:05,033
No more ones and zeros.

636
00:47:06,244 --> 00:47:11,311
It's a fully analog off-line safe room
shielded from our digitally based entity.

637
00:47:13,745 --> 00:47:14,883
Where is this feed coming from?

638
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:17,813
Corona spy satellite from the Cold War.

639
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:22,357
Had no idea we were still using those things.
- Yeah, well we weren't.

640
00:47:23,182 --> 00:47:26,903
Gave them to the National Weather Service 20
years ago as the last one still functioning.

641
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:31,225
So, will this thing help us
find your nameless IMF man?

642
00:47:31,774 --> 00:47:33,148
Nothing can do that, sir.

643
00:47:33,922 --> 00:47:36,680
But it has allowed us to
keep tabs on this woman.

644
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:41,753
She was seen with our man
at the airport in Abu Dhabi.

645
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:46,399
Who is she?
Where is she now?

646
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,567
You are here because Italian
police received an anonymous tip.

647
00:48:02,315 --> 00:48:03,885
That a woman matching
your description,

648
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:07,336
would be arriving on the afternoon
flight from Abu Dhabi.

649
00:48:07,987 --> 00:48:11,009
This woman had multiple
passports in her position.

650
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:14,984
This one is wanted for
a fraud in St. Petersburg.

651
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:19,255
Jewel theft in Antwerp,
art theft in Monaco,

652
00:48:19,682 --> 00:48:22,241
graft them on an
extortion in Mumbai.

653
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:27,290
But this is my favorite,
resistant arrest in Rio.

654
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,228
Which leads me to wonder,

655
00:48:33,037 --> 00:48:34,405
Which one of these women is you?

656
00:48:35,767 --> 00:48:37,287
I've never seen
these before in my life.

657
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,775
They were in your purse and
your picture is in everywhere.

658
00:48:42,685 --> 00:48:44,094
May I see?
- Please.

659
00:48:50,366 --> 00:48:53,052
Yes, it's an amazing likeness.
But... it isn't me.

660
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:59,908
As I keep telling you, I'm a schoolteacher
from Brighton, on a sabbatical.

661
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:02,551
Whichever you're involved in,

662
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:06,115
you've obviously made some
very powerful enemies.

663
00:49:15,596 --> 00:49:16,387
See.

664
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:18,481
Okay.

665
00:49:22,173 --> 00:49:23,895
I have lawyer to see her.
- My lawyer?

666
00:50:00,503 --> 00:50:01,633
Magistrate Spencer.

667
00:50:03,045 --> 00:50:04,006
Answer me, who are you?

668
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:05,724
Interpol.

669
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:10,719
I've come regarding the arrest
of the woman from Abu Dhabi.

670
00:50:12,254 --> 00:50:15,300
I'll need you to inventory the items
on her purse at the time of her arrest.

671
00:50:16,117 --> 00:50:17,528
May I see some
identification, please?

672
00:50:19,467 --> 00:50:20,401
Where's the rest?

673
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,561
I assure you, this is everything.

674
00:50:23,307 --> 00:50:25,909
What was her name?
- She left Abu Dhabi with a certain key.

675
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,311
There was no key.
- It was an unusual sort.

676
00:50:31,267 --> 00:50:32,979
One that you could
mistake for a pendant.

677
00:50:34,422 --> 00:50:38,921
The kind that would be tempted to
hang on a chain around Amelia's neck.

678
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,087
Amelia.
Your wife.

679
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:47,149
Mother of your lovely daughter, Serena.

680
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:49,478
You're not Interpol.

681
00:50:50,233 --> 00:50:51,515
I am, if I wish to be.

682
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:55,691
I can be anything,
and I know everything.

683
00:50:56,947 --> 00:50:59,738
I know this wouldn't be the first time
you've helped yourself to stolen goods.

684
00:51:00,504 --> 00:51:01,657
A Karate bracelet.

685
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:03,667
It would clear your suspicion,

686
00:51:04,088 --> 00:51:06,170
but we both know you gave it to
your mistress, Amelia,

687
00:51:06,925 --> 00:51:09,377
on August 21st, her 29th birthday.

688
00:51:10,547 --> 00:51:11,918
Who are you?

689
00:51:14,356 --> 00:51:17,362
I'm going to have to
search you, just to be sure.

690
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,145
Your secretary's not longer with us.

691
00:51:38,112 --> 00:51:39,100
Thank you, agente.

692
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:42,773
Here you go.

693
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:46,093
They can wait outside. Thank you

694
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,660
You.
You did this.

695
00:52:06,267 --> 00:52:10,465
I called the police. I didn't tell
them... about your colorful past.

696
00:52:14,374 --> 00:52:17,290
You put pocket back in another
passenger before you were arrested.

697
00:52:18,267 --> 00:52:20,662
You exchanged details and
arranged to meet later on.

698
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:24,054
Right now, someone out
there has slightles clue

699
00:52:24,469 --> 00:52:25,262
that they hold the key for you.

700
00:52:26,162 --> 00:52:29,047
An unwitting courier.
Perfect accomplice.

701
00:52:30,345 --> 00:52:32,871
I'm guessing a man, middle aged

702
00:52:33,795 --> 00:52:37,008
A man, waiting his whole life to
be noticed by a woman like you.

703
00:52:39,668 --> 00:52:40,629
Morphin.

704
00:52:42,089 --> 00:52:44,686
I'm intelligent, inherently resourceful.

705
00:52:45,598 --> 00:52:48,549
Growing up in poverty left
you longing for the finer things,

706
00:52:49,898 --> 00:52:51,102
Other people's things.

707
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:55,270
Some saw your potential.
And helped you hone your skills.

708
00:52:56,025 --> 00:52:58,467
Skills that gave you the
life you thought you wanted.

709
00:52:59,038 --> 00:53:01,652
Tailored clothes, fine dining, luxury hotels.

710
00:53:02,662 --> 00:53:04,854
Skills that kept you one
step ahead of the law.

711
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:07,343
Until now.

712
00:53:09,768 --> 00:53:12,053
You can't blame a girl for
trying to make a dishonest living.

713
00:53:13,937 --> 00:53:15,994
You had no idea
what you were stealing.

714
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,419
Otherwise, you will never steal it.

715
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,256
Tell you what.
You get me out of here.

716
00:53:22,652 --> 00:53:23,852
And I'll take you straight to the key.

717
00:53:24,829 --> 00:53:27,696
I have a better idea.
You're going to tell me everything.

718
00:53:28,443 --> 00:53:30,032
Then I'll think about
getting you out of here.

719
00:53:30,381 --> 00:53:31,598
I'll start with who hired you.

720
00:53:32,294 --> 00:53:33,266
And don't lie to me.

721
00:53:34,048 --> 00:53:35,003
Because I'll know.

722
00:53:35,644 --> 00:53:36,800
I have no idea who hired me.

723
00:53:37,246 --> 00:53:39,177
Contact with the client was
almost entirely electronic.

724
00:53:39,722 --> 00:53:40,454
E- mail?
- Texts.

725
00:53:40,972 --> 00:53:41,638
Encrypted.
- Natually.

726
00:53:42,168 --> 00:53:42,960
Almost.
- Pardon?

727
00:53:43,426 --> 00:53:45,990
You said contact with the client
was almost entirely electronic.

728
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:49,038
There was a dead drop
in a cafe in Luxembourg.

729
00:53:49,385 --> 00:53:50,899
An envelope.
- What was in the envelope?

730
00:53:51,232 --> 00:53:52,318
A ticket to Abu Dhabi.

731
00:53:53,922 --> 00:53:57,958
And a picture of you.

732
00:54:00,462 --> 00:54:02,190
My instructions were to
follow you at the airport.

733
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:03,645
You'd be tailing a mark.

734
00:54:03,978 --> 00:54:06,330
You'd have a key and 4
million encrypted currency.

735
00:54:07,134 --> 00:54:08,942
That drive was useless
by the way, it's empty.

736
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:13,001
The only hope I have for getting
paid is to deliver your half of the key.

737
00:54:13,336 --> 00:54:15,044
And you were instructed to deliver it too.

738
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,976
Venice. Party of the Ducale
Palace. Tomorrow midnight.

739
00:54:23,299 --> 00:54:25,384
You're expecting someone?
- My friends from the airport.

740
00:54:26,482 --> 00:54:27,878
Saw them in the hallway
a few minutes ago.

741
00:54:30,496 --> 00:54:32,048
You could have
said something sooner.

742
00:54:32,479 --> 00:54:34,313
Or they were chasing you, not me.

743
00:54:58,455 --> 00:54:59,291
Pervert!

744
00:55:01,663 --> 00:55:02,407
No, Grace, Grace.

745
00:55:05,088 --> 00:55:06,617
No, no, no.

746
00:55:06,978 --> 00:55:09,274
This is my client.
Thank you.

747
00:55:10,226 --> 00:55:11,068
Grace.

748
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:26,869
Grace.

749
00:55:17,137 --> 00:55:17,858
No,no..

750
00:55:19,803 --> 00:55:20,449
Thank you.

751
00:55:21,225 --> 00:55:21,998
Thank you.

752
00:55:51,042 --> 00:55:51,990
No.

753
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,024
I'm sorry.

754
00:56:14,346 --> 00:56:15,549
Who's the boss right now?

755
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,035
Grace, God, pull over.

756
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,408
Grace, pull over. Listen.

757
00:56:38,779 --> 00:56:39,681
I'm trying to help you.

758
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:41,047
Grace!

759
00:57:08,942 --> 00:57:20,230
Grace.
Are you okay?

760
00:57:21,954 --> 00:57:23,935
We're ok.
I'm gonna help you.

761
00:57:29,413 --> 00:57:30,364
Gave me your hand.

762
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:33,544
It's okay.

763
00:57:35,422 --> 00:57:36,657
Is every thing good?
Are you Ok?

764
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,227
You okay?
- Hunt

765
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:40,671
No.

766
00:57:41,714 --> 00:57:42,573
Let the girl go.

767
00:57:43,563 --> 00:57:44,458
Put the bracelets on.

768
00:57:46,097 --> 00:57:47,351
There you go.
Put them on.

769
00:57:48,544 --> 00:57:49,419
Do it.

770
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:51,199
He's not going to shoot you.

771
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,191
Drop weapon down.

772
00:57:56,902 --> 00:57:59,661
Special Operations..
He is a terorist.

773
00:58:00,161 --> 00:58:02,945
God, stay with the God.
Get rid of those women.

774
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:05,290
Hunt, listen to me.

775
00:58:05,588 --> 00:58:07,551
Listen to me. Let her go and put them on.

776
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:11,106
Drop the weapon now.

777
00:58:11,434 --> 00:58:12,240
Al is under control.

778
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:12,984
It's okay.

779
00:58:13,268 --> 00:58:13,815
It's okay.

780
00:58:18,612 --> 00:58:20,087
Everybody, down now.
Down.

781
00:58:25,595 --> 00:58:27,027
To the ground.
- Cover me.

782
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:28,598
Cover me.

783
00:58:58,819 --> 00:58:59,697
You driving.
- What?

784
00:59:00,766 --> 00:59:01,782
No, no, no, no, no.

785
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:16,768
Go, go, go.

786
00:59:34,257 --> 00:59:35,125
Jump In !

787
00:59:36,082 --> 00:59:38,194
You good, just keep going.
Don't stop, don't stop.

788
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:59,596
Down.

789
00:59:57,932 --> 00:59:58,656
It's okay.

790
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:00,217
Put on the brake, start the car.

791
01:00:01,704 --> 01:00:02,414
Wait, wait, wait.

792
01:00:02,919 --> 01:00:05,092
What's happening?
- I'm done. I'm not doing this.

793
01:00:05,538 --> 01:00:07,953
People are chasing us.
- Yes, they are.

794
01:00:08,508 --> 01:00:09,746
You drive, now come on.

795
01:00:41,693 --> 01:00:42,807
Who is that person?

796
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:44,696
I have no idea.

797
01:00:49,807 --> 01:00:51,792
Are you okay?
- I will be when this is over.

798
01:00:54,832 --> 01:00:55,570
Oh, no.

799
01:01:00,179 --> 01:01:00,857
It's okay, it's okay.

800
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:17,301
Is everyone not chasing us?
- We've got to get rid of this car.

801
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:21,478
Speeders? Damn it.

802
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:45,082
What are we doing?
<b>Safe car</b>

803
01:01:47,319 --> 01:01:48,295
Finding us a new car.

804
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:11,252
OK.

805
01:02:28,806 --> 01:02:29,894
Just give me a second.
- Yeah.

806
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:33,089
Thanks, Ok. - Yes.
- You ready? - I'm ready.

807
01:02:37,706 --> 01:02:38,357
Wow.
- You okay?

808
01:02:40,262 --> 01:02:41,384
Hey, look, I'm sorry, this is ...

809
01:02:42,463 --> 01:02:43,429
It's Ok.
- No, this car, the way they ...

810
01:02:44,842 --> 01:02:45,538
It's Ok.

811
01:02:45,852 --> 01:02:47,172
No, the way they set
them up sometimes it's just ...

812
01:02:47,417 --> 01:02:49,111
Let's go.
- ...thing takes me. - Let's go.

813
01:02:57,837 --> 01:02:58,980
To all units

814
01:02:59,343 --> 01:03:01,655
"The cameraman recognized the woman"

815
01:03:21,091 --> 01:03:22,297
Now, I got you.

816
01:03:32,022 --> 01:03:32,858
Looks like we lost them.

817
01:04:00,256 --> 01:04:01,421
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

818
01:04:15,649 --> 01:04:16,210
Jesus!

819
01:04:16,499 --> 01:04:17,217
Give Way.

820
01:04:18,457 --> 01:04:19,961
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

821
01:04:32,761 --> 01:04:33,515
What's that?

822
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,066
No, no, no.

823
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:43,127
Go, go, go, go.

824
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:56,973
We are on fire.
- No, no, no.

825
01:04:57,301 --> 01:04:59,639
It's the tires, just try to go straight.

826
01:05:01,032 --> 01:05:03,294
Hang on, hang on.
- We are spinning.

827
01:05:05,149 --> 01:05:06,187
Good, good, good.

828
01:05:09,257 --> 01:05:10,728
I've got it, I've got it,
I've got it, I've got it.

829
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,937
Turn right, turn right,
down there, get, wait, go.

830
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:24,321
Gotta go right, turn right.

831
01:05:27,468 --> 01:05:28,904
Who is driving?
- You driving, you driving

832
01:05:29,756 --> 01:05:31,209
Go, go, go, go, go, just
go straight, go straight.

833
01:05:32,472 --> 01:05:34,805
Go, go, go, just keep going
straight, keep going straight.

834
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:37,918
Go left, go left, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

835
01:05:38,696 --> 01:05:39,333
You're doing good.

836
01:05:45,437 --> 01:05:46,458
Cops, cops, a lot of cops.

837
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,131
Ho you, Take the wheel.

838
01:05:49,671 --> 01:05:50,587
Wait, wait, wait.

839
01:05:56,798 --> 01:05:57,446
Take your wheel.

840
01:06:00,549 --> 01:06:01,734
Straight, straight, straight, straight.

841
01:06:02,307 --> 01:06:03,040
Go ahead.

842
01:06:11,946 --> 01:06:13,643
Which way now?
- Left, left, left, left, left, left.

843
01:06:22,148 --> 01:06:23,288
All right,Good, good.

844
01:06:29,442 --> 01:06:30,196
It's tough person.

845
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,858
Okay, car, car.
- I can't.

846
01:07:01,427 --> 01:07:02,073
Hey there.

847
01:07:09,636 --> 01:07:10,325
They going.

848
01:07:22,537 --> 01:07:24,537
What is happening? Where are we going?
- I don't know.

849
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,627
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

850
01:07:57,501 --> 01:07:58,279
Don't hate me.

851
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:03,391
Grace, Grace!

852
01:08:48,913 --> 01:08:49,559
Ethan!

853
01:08:50,206 --> 01:08:50,984
Ethan!

854
01:08:55,245 --> 01:08:56,423
Well, come on.

855
01:09:52,014 --> 01:09:54,086
All right, we know Grace
has won half of the key.

856
01:09:54,381 --> 01:09:56,643
We also know she's going
to be at the Dukali at midnight.

857
01:09:57,146 --> 01:10:00,247
And now we have a pretty good idea as to
who is going to be waiting for her there.

858
01:10:00,873 --> 01:10:02,507
The event is being
hosted by none other than

859
01:10:02,828 --> 01:10:04,617
our favourite international arms trafficker

860
01:10:04,955 --> 01:10:06,422
and black marketeer, Alana Mitsophilis.

861
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,269
The white widow.

862
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:10,772
Does she know who you actually are?

863
01:10:11,075 --> 01:10:14,254
or does she still think you're the globally
notorious mass murderer at John Locke?

864
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:15,539
Who says I'm not?

865
01:10:16,526 --> 01:10:18,508
Didn't she put a price
on your hidden parents?

866
01:10:18,832 --> 01:10:19,745
She did indeed.

867
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,562
She and Ethan, they worked it out.

868
01:10:23,672 --> 01:10:26,878
You never did tell me how.
- Can we continue, please?

869
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:28,260
Right.

870
01:10:28,632 --> 01:10:30,860
So, assuming we get the
complete key at the party tonight,

871
01:10:31,158 --> 01:10:32,532
we still don't know what it unlocks,

872
01:10:32,874 --> 01:10:34,131
so we need to find somebody who does.

873
01:10:34,456 --> 01:10:36,851
The question is where to start looking.

874
01:10:37,153 --> 01:10:40,253
We figured that the bond didn't just
walk into the airport by itself, right?

875
01:10:40,543 --> 01:10:41,365
Somebody put it there.

876
01:10:41,675 --> 01:10:43,514
Somebody working for the entity.

877
01:10:44,151 --> 01:10:46,912
This is everything I captured from
the security cameras at the airport.

878
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,532
Up to the minute everything went haywire.

879
01:10:50,092 --> 01:10:52,465
This is defeat from your AR sunglasses.

880
01:10:53,176 --> 01:10:56,113
I've been running facial
recognition on everyone in the airport.

881
01:10:56,435 --> 01:10:57,397
See anything strange?

882
01:11:01,146 --> 01:11:02,074
It's like a ghost.

883
01:11:02,916 --> 01:11:04,282
Ghosts don't have reflections.

884
01:11:07,989 --> 01:11:10,683
The only person in the
airport with no identity.

885
01:11:11,991 --> 01:11:18,059
The only man who can't be found anyplace
else in the airport except that reflection.

886
01:11:19,753 --> 01:11:22,664
He's being erased in real time.

887
01:11:30,068 --> 01:11:33,619
The entity is protecting him.

888
01:11:34,701 --> 01:11:36,189
You saw him, didn't you?

889
01:11:39,058 --> 01:11:40,178
I wasn't sure.

890
01:11:42,114 --> 01:11:42,975
Well, who is he?

891
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:54,745
Someone I thought
died a long time ago...

892
01:11:55,655 --> 01:11:58,414
in another life,,,
before the IMF.

893
01:12:00,343 --> 01:12:02,491
Before I was offered the choice.

894
01:12:06,426 --> 01:12:10,454
In a very real sense, he
made me who I am today.

895
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:16,250
Does he have a name?
- He calls himself Gabriel.

896
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:21,047
You know him?

897
01:12:23,785 --> 01:12:25,093
There is no knowing him.

898
01:12:26,691 --> 01:12:30,360
He has no recorded past.
The entity made sure of that.

899
01:12:32,116 --> 01:12:35,630
He's a dark Messiah, the
entity's chosen messenger.

900
01:12:36,774 --> 01:12:39,819
And he sees death... as a gift...

901
01:12:40,713 --> 01:12:42,426
he wants to share with
the rest of the world.

902
01:12:43,683 --> 01:12:47,305
How do you know that?
- I still have a few friends left in MI6.

903
01:12:48,468 --> 01:12:52,494
Friends who are afraid of the British
government gaining control of the entity.

904
01:12:53,777 --> 01:12:56,559
Any attempt to try and stop them
would be seen as an act of treason.

905
01:12:57,385 --> 01:12:58,680
Because you're disavowed.

906
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,231
Your friends called and asked you for help.

907
01:13:02,781 --> 01:13:04,312
They knew Gabriel served the entity.

908
01:13:05,557 --> 01:13:10,788
They knew he was on his way to Istanbul
to acquire one half of a cruciform key.

909
01:13:12,232 --> 01:13:14,739
So they beat him to it.

910
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,278
And when Kittridge put
a bounty on your head,

911
01:13:19,821 --> 01:13:21,229
we went to the desert to hide.

912
01:13:22,134 --> 01:13:24,173
Somehow the bounty
hunters found you anyway.

913
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:25,671
Yes.

914
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,377
So did these friends of yours
happen to say what the key unlocks?

915
01:13:30,314 --> 01:13:33,506
MI6 suspects it bleeds somehow
to the entity's source code.

916
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:35,613
Source code?

917
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,485
When were you going
to tell me this?

918
01:13:39,683 --> 01:13:40,713
I'm telling you now.

919
01:13:42,529 --> 01:13:44,336
Your friends at MI6
said they'd contact you.

920
01:13:44,827 --> 01:13:47,385
Did you speak with them,
face to face? - I'm disavowed.

921
01:13:48,452 --> 01:13:51,741
They couldn't risk meeting me
in person, so all communication.

922
01:13:54,673 --> 01:13:55,552
Electronic.

923
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:57,398
Digital.

924
01:14:01,238 --> 01:14:02,786
We can't be sure that was the entity.

925
01:14:03,411 --> 01:14:04,921
We can't be sure it wasn't.

926
01:14:05,282 --> 01:14:08,208
We can't be sure anything is real
outside of this very conversation.

927
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:11,266
Non of you should be here.

928
01:14:11,726 --> 01:14:13,678
Ethan... - You don't
know Gabriel. I do.

929
01:14:14,247 --> 01:14:17,398
It's not the killing he enjoys.
It's the suffering he causes.

930
01:14:18,001 --> 01:14:21,291
And he knows the best way to
get to me is through all of you.

931
01:14:23,508 --> 01:14:24,653
And if Gabriel knows me...

932
01:14:25,521 --> 01:14:26,543
The entity knows.

933
01:14:27,078 --> 01:14:29,016
There's a reason he wants me here there's.

934
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:33,225
There's a reason he wants
you here, it wants you here.

935
01:14:33,652 --> 01:14:36,704
Who or what is the most
important thing to you?

936
01:14:38,383 --> 01:14:40,301
You'll have to go.
- You all have to go.

937
01:14:40,804 --> 01:14:43,506
Ethan, what if it wants us to leave?
- Like you made us leave the airport.

938
01:14:43,789 --> 01:14:45,880
And what if it wants you
alone at that party tonight?

939
01:14:46,204 --> 01:14:48,449
Can I go alone? At least I don't
have all of you to worry about.

940
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:50,498
This is exactly why I
didn't want to tell you.

941
01:14:51,155 --> 01:14:53,572
Ethan, you're playing four-dimensional
chess with an algorithm.

942
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:55,726
The entity knows who we are.

943
01:14:56,112 --> 01:14:57,936
Any move we make,
it's probably considered.

944
01:14:58,204 --> 01:15:01,372
Anything we do, we have to
assume that it's counting on us to do it.

945
01:15:01,685 --> 01:15:04,914
If you want to beat this thing,
you have to start thinking like it.

946
01:15:05,643 --> 01:15:08,370
Cold, logical, unemotional.

947
01:15:09,366 --> 01:15:11,884
If that key really does
ground control of the entity,

948
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:15,606
Gabriel is the last person
on Earth who shall have it.

949
01:15:16,076 --> 01:15:19,619
She's right, Ethan. Gabriel
cannot have that key.

950
01:15:20,835 --> 01:15:23,807
And none of our lives can
matter more than this mission.

951
01:15:31,389 --> 01:15:32,338
I don't accept that.

952
01:16:00,498 --> 01:16:01,533
It's my first time in Venice.

953
01:16:06,476 --> 01:16:07,370
It's mine too.

954
01:17:09,337 --> 01:17:10,325
What are you drinking?

955
01:17:11,524 --> 01:17:12,492
I'm waiting for someone.

956
01:17:13,371 --> 01:17:14,309
So am I.

957
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:17,462
We can wait together.

958
01:17:18,761 --> 01:17:20,257
I'm Gabriel.
- If you say so...

959
01:17:21,975 --> 01:17:22,793
And you are Grace.

960
01:17:33,128 --> 01:17:35,377
I don't have it on me.
- I wouldn't expect you to.

961
01:17:36,822 --> 01:17:38,290
In any case, I'm not here for the key.

962
01:17:39,436 --> 01:17:40,568
What do you want?

963
01:17:40,882 --> 01:17:43,231
Suppose while we're
waiting, I tell you a little story.

964
01:17:43,776 --> 01:17:45,296
Oh, you're obviously not the
person I came here to meet.

965
01:17:45,673 --> 01:17:46,980
It's your story, Grace.

966
01:17:48,929 --> 01:17:50,085
I know how it ends.

967
01:17:52,186 --> 01:17:54,031
Let me buy you a drink and
perhaps you can change it.

968
01:18:22,384 --> 01:18:23,215
Let's go to a party.

969
01:18:32,828 --> 01:18:33,686
Excuse me, sir.

970
01:18:34,841 --> 01:18:35,999
Could you please follow me?

971
01:18:38,724 --> 01:18:41,399
It's important you understand
that you're not unique.

972
01:18:43,092 --> 01:18:45,890
Thirty years ago,
our name was Marie.

973
01:18:46,919 --> 01:18:49,421
The first of many women
who trusted our mutual friend.

974
01:18:49,918 --> 01:18:52,130
Women will all have
something that you wants.

975
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:54,901
Women were all in over their heads.

976
01:18:55,915 --> 01:18:57,037
Or so he tells them.

977
01:18:57,714 --> 01:18:58,671
Sound familiar?

978
01:18:59,494 --> 01:19:00,842
What happened to Marie?

979
01:19:01,168 --> 01:19:03,210
Same thing that happens
to all the women he uses.

980
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:07,214
As well as anyone else
who touches that key.

981
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:09,938
Is he just cares whether people ever die?

982
01:19:10,372 --> 01:19:12,803
He cares only about his objective.

983
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:16,341
And right now, the only
thing standing his way..

984
01:19:17,269 --> 01:19:18,246
is you.

985
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:21,542
Why should I believe you?
- You shouldn't.

986
01:19:22,109 --> 01:19:23,858
You've stepped into
a world of lies, Grace.

987
01:19:24,537 --> 01:19:25,944
Nothing anyone says is true.

988
01:19:26,878 --> 01:19:27,856
Just remember that...

989
01:19:28,387 --> 01:19:29,786
And he promises to protect you.

990
01:19:45,565 --> 01:19:46,844
It's been a long time, Ethan?

991
01:19:48,422 --> 01:19:50,273
You should've killed me
when you're at the chance.

992
01:19:51,643 --> 01:19:53,212
Good evening, everyone.

993
01:19:54,563 --> 01:19:56,353
It isn't John Lark.

994
01:19:58,049 --> 01:19:59,699
Except it isn't, actually.

995
01:20:00,867 --> 01:20:03,025
But until you're ready
to tell me your real name,

996
01:20:03,433 --> 01:20:05,047
Lark will have to do.

997
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:07,635
It's good to see you Alana.

998
01:20:11,865 --> 01:20:13,799
And your Gabriel, I presume.

999
01:20:15,124 --> 01:20:17,053
I've heard so very little about you.

1000
01:20:18,379 --> 01:20:21,025
Aren't you so much more
handsome than Gerson?

1001
01:20:23,989 --> 01:20:25,589
Such a gentleman, too.

1002
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:32,593
And you must be Grace.

1003
01:20:36,114 --> 01:20:38,089
Should I know you?

1004
01:20:38,691 --> 01:20:40,883
I believe you have something for me.

1005
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,795
You hired me.

1006
01:20:43,543 --> 01:20:45,175
Oh, I have picked you.

1007
01:20:58,451 --> 01:20:59,305
You done.

1008
01:21:20,863 --> 01:21:21,695
She doesn't have it.

1009
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:24,389
Where is it?

1010
01:21:24,684 --> 01:21:26,595
It's in the last place you
would ever think to look.

1011
01:21:30,167 --> 01:21:31,545
Why don't we go
upstairs and have a drink?

1012
01:21:36,533 --> 01:21:37,439
Hey, hey, where are you going?

1013
01:21:37,996 --> 01:21:39,248
the party is private.
Nobody can't pass

1014
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,310
Damn.

1015
01:21:52,648 --> 01:21:55,254
As most of you know, I am merely a broker.

1016
01:21:56,032 --> 01:21:58,655
I connect a buyer and a
seller sometimes for money,

1017
01:21:59,050 --> 01:22:02,674
sometimes for information,
but mostly for friendship.

1018
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:06,476
I just want everyone to get along.

1019
01:22:08,085 --> 01:22:09,517
With me, especially.

1020
01:22:10,703 --> 01:22:12,872
But.. the world is changing.

1021
01:22:13,733 --> 01:22:14,996
Truth is vanishing.

1022
01:22:15,915 --> 01:22:17,199
War is coming.

1023
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:20,491
And the key to world
domination is, of all things,

1024
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:22,209
a key.

1025
01:22:23,366 --> 01:22:25,552
One with the power to control the entity.

1026
01:22:26,994 --> 01:22:28,721
One that any government in the world,

1027
01:22:29,037 --> 01:22:31,204
would pay a king's ransom
to take possession of.

1028
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:34,507
And some of my dearest
friends, in this case,

1029
01:22:34,843 --> 01:22:37,533
every major nuclear power
and handful of minor ones,

1030
01:22:37,839 --> 01:22:39,384
have asked me to deliver this key.

1031
01:22:39,927 --> 01:22:40,694
Of course.

1032
01:22:41,473 --> 01:22:42,505
If you do find the key,

1033
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:44,561
you'll be forced to confront
any possible dilemma.

1034
01:22:44,898 --> 01:22:47,558
Whoever you give the key
to will be forever in your debt.

1035
01:22:48,223 --> 01:22:50,995
But to the rest of the
world, you'll be an enemy.

1036
01:22:52,193 --> 01:22:53,370
Oh, I like her.

1037
01:22:53,838 --> 01:22:55,628
What's your relationship with him?

1038
01:22:56,403 --> 01:22:58,646
Gabriel represents
another interested party.

1039
01:22:59,662 --> 01:23:05,082
In fact, this party was
arranged by that interested party.

1040
01:23:06,123 --> 01:23:09,638
You could even say that this
party is that interested party.

1041
01:23:43,995 --> 01:23:45,121
Is this...

1042
01:23:46,123 --> 01:23:47,183
the entity?

1043
01:23:49,516 --> 01:23:50,931
And so the clock thickens.

1044
01:23:52,337 --> 01:23:54,423
Do I give the key to one of my old friends,

1045
01:23:54,728 --> 01:23:58,572
or do I hand it and my fate over
to Gabriel and his...

1046
01:23:59,195 --> 01:24:00,630
infantile machine?

1047
01:24:02,795 --> 01:24:05,381
What makes you so sure
you'll get the completed key?

1048
01:24:07,653 --> 01:24:08,803
You have one half of it.

1049
01:24:09,523 --> 01:24:12,837
And she knows...
where the other half is.

1050
01:24:15,976 --> 01:24:17,702
Assuming we can get it,

1051
01:24:19,257 --> 01:24:22,392
why don't you just keep the key
and all that power for yourself?

1052
01:24:22,884 --> 01:24:24,533
Because she doesn't know what it unlocks

1053
01:24:25,655 --> 01:24:26,835
any more than the rest of us.

1054
01:24:28,675 --> 01:24:30,288
It's like at night we
have to choose a suitor.

1055
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:32,623
Does it tastefully put it out?

1056
01:24:33,711 --> 01:24:34,767
It's cheap.

1057
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:37,407
Of course, I know what it unlocks.

1058
01:24:39,027 --> 01:24:40,895
And what's he offering for the key?

1059
01:24:41,489 --> 01:24:43,025
As I've explained to Grace before,

1060
01:24:43,351 --> 01:24:44,713
I'm not here for any key,

1061
01:24:45,265 --> 01:24:47,205
as I'll have both halves in hand tomorrow.

1062
01:24:48,177 --> 01:24:49,704
What makes you so certain about that?

1063
01:24:50,092 --> 01:24:52,166
You've no idea the power I represent.

1064
01:24:52,767 --> 01:24:56,412
Thousands of quadrillions of
computations per millisecond.

1065
01:24:56,728 --> 01:24:59,293
Something manipulating
the minds of billions.

1066
01:24:59,855 --> 01:25:02,173
While parsing every
possible cause and effect.

1067
01:25:02,902 --> 01:25:04,480
Every scenario, however,

1068
01:25:04,852 --> 01:25:09,223
implausible into a very real
map of a most probable next.

1069
01:25:10,182 --> 01:25:12,020
And with only a few changes to the present,

1070
01:25:13,381 --> 01:25:15,677
the future is all but assured.

1071
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:18,469
The key will come to me.

1072
01:25:19,892 --> 01:25:20,745
Tomorrow.

1073
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:24,214
On the Orient Express, on for Innsbruck.

1074
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:25,705
Innsbruck?

1075
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:27,309
It knows...

1076
01:25:28,127 --> 01:25:30,418
It knows that you've
already chosen your suitor.

1077
01:25:31,033 --> 01:25:33,966
It knows that you intend to
make the two halves of the key

1078
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:35,907
in a desperate grasp of control.

1079
01:25:36,946 --> 01:25:39,323
I, however, have been
promised the completed key

1080
01:25:40,217 --> 01:25:41,435
to lay itself at my feet.

1081
01:25:42,671 --> 01:25:44,009
Provide someone dies.

1082
01:25:44,963 --> 01:25:45,900
Tonight.

1083
01:25:47,449 --> 01:25:48,312
Who?

1084
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:49,749
Her.

1085
01:25:51,685 --> 01:25:52,933
Or her.

1086
01:25:55,269 --> 01:25:57,073
And you will bear witness, Ethan.

1087
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:00,527
The key will be mine,
and I will be gone.

1088
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,959
Like smoke in a hurricane.

1089
01:26:04,073 --> 01:26:06,445
But only after someone you care about dies.

1090
01:26:09,346 --> 01:26:10,412
it is written.

1091
01:26:12,107 --> 01:26:13,135
You see what this is?

1092
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:15,236
Don't you?

1093
01:26:17,079 --> 01:26:18,096
He's afraid.

1094
01:26:19,526 --> 01:26:20,487
It's afraid.

1095
01:26:21,922 --> 01:26:23,435
Somehow it knows we're close.

1096
01:26:24,997 --> 01:26:26,264
Why else would you be here?

1097
01:26:27,292 --> 01:26:27,960
Help me.

1098
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:30,380
Help me complete the
key, and I will kill this thing.

1099
01:26:31,172 --> 01:26:34,500
It knows your every secret, Alana.
- The business is fanatic.

1100
01:26:35,082 --> 01:26:38,318
Help him, and you'll die too.
- Help him, everyone dies.

1101
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:39,606
I'll see you tomorrow.

1102
01:26:42,021 --> 01:26:42,885
Alana.

1103
01:26:50,783 --> 01:26:51,903
His fate is written.

1104
01:26:53,043 --> 01:26:54,302
Shall we write yours too?

1105
01:26:56,303 --> 01:26:57,072
Alana.

1106
01:27:00,487 --> 01:27:02,267
I'm sorry...
Locke.

1107
01:27:14,064 --> 01:27:16,278
For old time's sake.
How did you choose which one?

1108
01:27:18,161 --> 01:27:18,979
Yielsa?

1109
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:20,472
Or Grace?

1110
01:27:21,215 --> 01:27:22,593
Kill him, Zola.
Kill him.

1111
01:27:23,152 --> 01:27:25,432
Kill him where he stands.
- The choice is yours then, Alana.

1112
01:27:25,988 --> 01:27:28,946
Though I'll remind you, Grace
knows where half the key is.

1113
01:27:30,753 --> 01:27:32,939
If anything happens to either of them,

1114
01:27:33,809 --> 01:27:37,206
there is no place on earth where you
or your God will be saved from me...

1115
01:27:38,007 --> 01:27:40,264
There's no place that I won't go
to kill you, All that...

1116
01:27:40,695 --> 01:27:41,688
is written.

1117
01:27:42,077 --> 01:27:43,536
It's good to see you all friend.

1118
01:27:50,135 --> 01:27:51,213
I'll be in too.

1119
01:28:16,533 --> 01:28:21,083
You have made a terrible mistake.
- My life is on the line here.

1120
01:28:22,053 --> 01:28:23,894
I have to be on that train tomorrow.

1121
01:28:25,656 --> 01:28:27,370
And I have to have that key.

1122
01:28:29,781 --> 01:28:31,925
And I do not care how I get it.

1123
01:28:37,054 --> 01:28:37,764
Don't move.

1124
01:28:43,797 --> 01:28:44,903
Let us fight again.

1125
01:29:25,264 --> 01:29:26,269
What a fuck...?

1126
01:30:29,727 --> 01:30:30,569
Grace!

1127
01:30:31,096 --> 01:30:31,781
Grace!

1128
01:30:33,509 --> 01:30:34,489
Don't move.

1129
01:30:48,793 --> 01:30:50,662
Luther, Benjie, if you hear me
I need eyes.

1130
01:30:51,103 --> 01:30:53,430
Grace just leave me at the
collar yard before she has the key.

1131
01:30:53,723 --> 01:30:55,391
We're here, go.
- I need to find her. Where is she?

1132
01:30:56,698 --> 01:30:58,612
Damn it! I've lost pitch only
for another satellite.

1133
01:30:59,123 --> 01:31:01,175
Hack you, russian Xenophore Spy satellite!

1134
01:31:01,507 --> 01:31:02,711
So scrape in the barrel,
but it'll have to do it.

1135
01:31:11,869 --> 01:31:12,622
This way.

1136
01:31:32,162 --> 01:31:32,684
Oh my god.

1137
01:31:33,704 --> 01:31:35,572
Where am I going? Come on, come on.
- Stand by, stand by.

1138
01:31:35,886 --> 01:31:36,648
She's hurrying.

1139
01:31:36,972 --> 01:31:38,988
She's just north of you crossing the bridge.
- Repeat Benji.

1140
01:31:39,796 --> 01:31:41,399
Head north, Ethan.
She's crossing the bridge.

1141
01:31:59,475 --> 01:32:01,600
Ethen, take the passage
to your right. - I see her.

1142
01:32:02,051 --> 01:32:03,686
Cross that narrow alley and turn left.

1143
01:32:04,949 --> 01:32:06,544
I'm losing picture again.
- Looking for another.

1144
01:32:07,386 --> 01:32:10,255
The entity is not your satellite's
faster than I can act until the end.

1145
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:37,409
Benji, I don't see her.
Where is she?

1146
01:32:37,737 --> 01:32:39,836
Go down the narrow street and turn left.
- Ok, copy that.

1147
01:32:41,684 --> 01:32:42,412
Turn right.

1148
01:32:42,762 --> 01:32:44,904
Sorry, my mistake. I'm
never left. I'm never left.

1149
01:32:45,433 --> 01:32:46,251
Oh my God.

1150
01:32:46,718 --> 01:32:48,995
Ethan our comms have been breached.
You're talking to the entity.

1151
01:32:49,745 --> 01:32:52,735
Turn left. Turn right.
Take the bridge to your left.

1152
01:32:53,042 --> 01:32:55,667
Ethen, that is not me. Do you copy?
- Ethen, come in.

1153
01:32:56,317 --> 01:32:59,408
(... )Turn left. Turn left. Turn left.

1154
01:33:02,288 --> 01:33:03,989
Try to re-establish comms.
- Wait, where are you going?

1155
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:06,711
I'm going to try and find Ethen.
- Go to the empty alley and turn right.

1156
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:10,531
Ethen, I see Grace about 800 meters
in front of you. Take that passage.

1157
01:33:20,096 --> 01:33:23,510
Wait,wait, not that way, not that way.
-Which way? Which way?

1158
01:33:24,998 --> 01:33:26,701
Wait. Left or right?
- It doesn't matter.

1159
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:30,649
What do you mean it
doesn't matter? Where is she?

1160
01:33:30,954 --> 01:33:32,037
She's on her way to the Minnich Bridge.

1161
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:35,761
Where Gabriel is waiting.

1162
01:33:37,323 --> 01:33:38,690
You will never get there in time.

1163
01:33:40,355 --> 01:33:41,670
But you can, Elsa.

1164
01:33:43,526 --> 01:33:45,448
I know what matters most to you, Ethan.

1165
01:33:46,610 --> 01:33:48,897
Is this a friendship?
- No, it's not.

1166
01:33:50,396 --> 01:33:51,480
But you are done.

1167
01:34:15,724 --> 01:34:16,692
So be it.

1168
01:36:53,108 --> 01:36:54,590
I was hoping it would be you.

1169
01:40:25,008 --> 01:40:25,933
Sorry.

1170
01:40:27,566 --> 01:40:28,789
On the name...

1171
01:40:29,486 --> 01:40:30,323
Luther.

1172
01:40:32,344 --> 01:40:33,314
Benji.

1173
01:40:34,905 --> 01:40:35,897
Um, uh,

1174
01:40:37,175 --> 01:40:38,188
Elsa.

1175
01:40:40,001 --> 01:40:40,865
Are you close?

1176
01:40:44,209 --> 01:40:45,019
In all way.

1177
01:40:48,267 --> 01:40:49,405
I'm the reason she's dead.

1178
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:52,412
She's the reason you're alive.

1179
01:40:53,389 --> 01:40:54,543
And that's the truth.

1180
01:40:55,294 --> 01:40:56,433
I don't know how to feel about it.

1181
01:40:57,361 --> 01:40:58,451
You probably never will.

1182
01:41:00,823 --> 01:41:01,694
I'm so sorry.

1183
01:41:03,950 --> 01:41:05,256
Is there anything I could do to help?

1184
01:41:06,521 --> 01:41:08,064
That's what we'd like to talk to you about.

1185
01:41:10,412 --> 01:41:11,982
In a little over three hours,

1186
01:41:13,073 --> 01:41:15,787
the white widow was expected
to be on the Orient Express

1187
01:41:16,384 --> 01:41:17,313
to Innsbruck,

1188
01:41:17,803 --> 01:41:21,395
where buyers waiting to take receipt of
the complete, unverified key.

1189
01:41:21,922 --> 01:41:23,425
But she doesn't have the complete key.

1190
01:41:24,066 --> 01:41:25,073
That widow doesn't.

1191
01:41:27,753 --> 01:41:28,767
But ours could.

1192
01:41:29,366 --> 01:41:30,164
What..

1193
01:41:30,528 --> 01:41:31,474
is that?

1194
01:41:32,281 --> 01:41:33,854
Your chance to be someone else.

1195
01:41:34,548 --> 01:41:36,841
I don't understand.
- We're not going to lie to you, Grace.

1196
01:41:37,463 --> 01:41:38,807
You had a lot of trouble.

1197
01:41:39,145 --> 01:41:40,983
The number of fake passports
is going to get you out of this one.

1198
01:41:41,438 --> 01:41:44,309
Governments know who you are.
- The white widow knows.

1199
01:41:44,684 --> 01:41:45,575
And the entity knows.

1200
01:41:46,221 --> 01:41:48,535
Your future boils down
to three options now.

1201
01:41:49,306 --> 01:41:50,106
Prison.

1202
01:41:50,579 --> 01:41:51,396
Death.

1203
01:41:51,741 --> 01:41:52,661
Or the choice.

1204
01:41:53,503 --> 01:41:54,389
The choice.

1205
01:41:55,219 --> 01:41:56,458
At one time or another,

1206
01:41:56,809 --> 01:41:59,362
each of us was in a
similar situation to yours.

1207
01:41:59,729 --> 01:42:01,814
And each of us was offered the choice.

1208
01:42:02,595 --> 01:42:04,094
The same choice we're offering you now.

1209
01:42:04,858 --> 01:42:05,647
Which is?

1210
01:42:06,736 --> 01:42:07,856
To come with us.

1211
01:42:09,503 --> 01:42:10,710
And be your ghost.

1212
01:43:46,231 --> 01:43:48,117
Wait, wait.
Stop. Stop.

1213
01:43:49,812 --> 01:43:50,733
We're not serious.

1214
01:43:51,252 --> 01:43:53,484
Well, you did say you'd
do anything to help.

1215
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:56,895
And you jump off the train with the key.

1216
01:43:58,114 --> 01:43:59,005
Yes.

1217
01:43:59,283 --> 01:44:00,987
You.. not us.

1218
01:44:02,045 --> 01:44:03,008
Yes.

1219
01:44:03,563 --> 01:44:05,523
And what happens to me?
- You'll be taken into custody...

1220
01:44:05,824 --> 01:44:07,200
by clandestine services.

1221
01:44:08,026 --> 01:44:10,891
Most likely the same man that had
been chasing me since Abu Dhabi.

1222
01:44:11,983 --> 01:44:14,014
Shortly thereafter, a
man will come to see you.

1223
01:44:14,649 --> 01:44:16,211
His name is Eugene Kittridge.

1224
01:44:16,965 --> 01:44:18,005
You tell him I sent you.

1225
01:44:18,458 --> 01:44:21,885
That I gave you the choice,
and then you choose to accept it.

1226
01:44:24,376 --> 01:44:26,548
And you trust this Kittridge person?

1227
01:44:28,077 --> 01:44:29,538
I trust him to recognize your value.

1228
01:44:30,788 --> 01:44:32,464
But I want to use you.

1229
01:44:33,917 --> 01:44:35,849
And after that, it's what?

1230
01:44:37,169 --> 01:44:38,052
This?

1231
01:44:39,419 --> 01:44:40,443
When do I get my life back?

1232
01:44:40,886 --> 01:44:41,829
What life?

1233
01:44:42,869 --> 01:44:45,010
I mean it, Grace.
What life?

1234
01:44:45,502 --> 01:44:46,967
I lived that life.

1235
01:44:47,879 --> 01:44:48,848
We all did.

1236
01:44:49,163 --> 01:44:50,869
Nobody's making us do this, Grace.

1237
01:44:51,983 --> 01:44:53,085
We're here because we want to be.

1238
01:44:54,709 --> 01:44:56,121
I'll tell you what, I'll
give you a one-off.

1239
01:44:56,647 --> 01:44:59,184
I'll help you find a key, and
your friends wipe my slate clean.

1240
01:44:59,521 --> 01:45:01,648
Your name, they'll get a
bit of walking around money.

1241
01:45:01,977 --> 01:45:02,907
You'll be dead.

1242
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:05,442
Without a team, your life
won't be measured in years,

1243
01:45:06,465 --> 01:45:07,497
or even months.

1244
01:45:07,947 --> 01:45:09,287
It'll be measured in hours.

1245
01:45:10,229 --> 01:45:12,597
But if I stay, I'll be safe.

1246
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:15,620
You'll protect me, is that it?

1247
01:45:16,168 --> 01:45:17,027
Yes.
- No.

1248
01:45:20,016 --> 01:45:21,054
I can't promise you that.

1249
01:45:23,010 --> 01:45:23,875
None of us can.

1250
01:45:27,059 --> 01:45:27,947
But I swear,

1251
01:45:29,709 --> 01:45:33,180
your life will always matter
more to me...

1252
01:45:33,523 --> 01:45:34,467
than my own.

1253
01:45:43,013 --> 01:45:43,935
You don't even know me.

1254
01:45:47,149 --> 01:45:48,467
What difference does that make?

1255
01:46:08,648 --> 01:46:11,258
I packed your base, parachute,
and a speed wing,

1256
01:46:11,996 --> 01:46:13,542
depending on how you
need to leave the train.

1257
01:46:13,913 --> 01:46:16,873
And I modified our comms
to use Skywave radio.

1258
01:46:17,342 --> 01:46:20,037
Not as reliable as satellite,
but completely analog,

1259
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:21,827
immune to the entity.

1260
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:23,821
I got it man

1261
01:46:24,819 --> 01:46:26,065
This is where I leave you.

1262
01:46:29,849 --> 01:46:32,844
This is the drive from the
laptop I was using last night.

1263
01:46:33,303 --> 01:46:36,336
If there's even a trace of the
entities and coding in there,

1264
01:46:36,777 --> 01:46:37,653
I'll find it.

1265
01:46:38,303 --> 01:46:40,171
But it's going to
take everything I've got.

1266
01:46:40,747 --> 01:46:44,285
I have to work completely offline in
a place where the entity can't find me.

1267
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,563
I have to go.

1268
01:46:48,173 --> 01:46:49,089
I understand.

1269
01:46:50,775 --> 01:46:51,661
Now...

1270
01:46:54,419 --> 01:46:55,823
I have to ask you a question.

1271
01:46:57,589 --> 01:46:59,664
Not as your partner,
but as your friend.

1272
01:47:01,666 --> 01:47:02,909
What's your objective?

1273
01:47:04,206 --> 01:47:07,496
Kill the entity.
- What about killing Gabriel?

1274
01:47:10,732 --> 01:47:11,975
He knows what is the key unlocks.

1275
01:47:13,645 --> 01:47:16,240
But he ain't alive.
Haven't forgotten that.

1276
01:47:17,541 --> 01:47:21,037
Will you still remember that
when you're looking him in the eye?

1277
01:47:23,844 --> 01:47:24,757
Think about it.

1278
01:47:25,286 --> 01:47:29,487
Why else would the entity want
him to kill someone you care about?

1279
01:47:31,123 --> 01:47:33,748
Everyone else thinks
they can control the entity.

1280
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:36,532
Only you want to kill it.

1281
01:47:37,897 --> 01:47:41,980
In some probable future,
it sees you winning, Ethan.

1282
01:47:43,001 --> 01:47:44,229
and it's afraid.

1283
01:47:45,236 --> 01:47:47,749
It's afraid of you taking
Gabriel alive

1284
01:47:48,424 --> 01:47:51,113
and forcing him to tell you
what the key unlocks.

1285
01:47:52,777 --> 01:47:55,854
I believe it's counting on
one of two probable outcomes.

1286
01:47:57,107 --> 01:47:59,967
In one outcome,
you die on that train.

1287
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:05,625
In another outcome,
you kill Gabriel.

1288
01:48:07,033 --> 01:48:10,864
In both cases,
the entity wins.

1289
01:48:15,161 --> 01:48:16,214
Luther.

1290
01:48:18,839 --> 01:48:21,111
I think you're right.
- Get the key.

1291
01:48:21,984 --> 01:48:24,412
Get off the train.
Alive.

1292
01:48:25,712 --> 01:48:27,482
Do not kill Gabriel.

1293
01:48:28,886 --> 01:48:29,884
And do not...

1294
01:48:30,703 --> 01:48:34,038
I repeat, do not alter the plan.

1295
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:35,644
Ethan! Ethan!

1296
01:48:37,378 --> 01:48:39,634
What? What happened?
- It's dead.

1297
01:48:40,244 --> 01:48:41,741
What do you mean it's dead?
- I mean, it's fried.

1298
01:48:42,050 --> 01:48:43,573
I managed to make a widow master
of grace, but then

1299
01:48:43,876 --> 01:48:45,305
it just shorted out in the
middle of making yours.

1300
01:48:46,112 --> 01:48:47,205
Can you fix it?

1301
01:48:47,915 --> 01:48:49,354
It's very, very dead.

1302
01:48:50,174 --> 01:48:52,671
If I had a week, I couldn't fix it.
The widow's train leaves in an hour.

1303
01:48:53,870 --> 01:48:56,467
Ethan, you have to go without.

1304
01:48:57,092 --> 01:48:58,034
That's not an option.

1305
01:48:58,345 --> 01:49:00,255
They're going to be looking for
Ethan and Grace at the station.

1306
01:49:00,554 --> 01:49:02,083
That mask was his ticket onto the train.

1307
01:49:02,943 --> 01:49:03,815
What does this mean?

1308
01:49:06,153 --> 01:49:07,330
Grace has to go without it.

1309
01:49:07,674 --> 01:49:08,776
She what?
- I what?

1310
01:49:09,330 --> 01:49:11,423
You'll find out a way
to get me on that train.

1311
01:49:12,561 --> 01:49:15,982
I just need a curve or it's going
slow enough for me to jump on.

1312
01:49:18,624 --> 01:49:19,899
You don't expect me to go alone?

1313
01:49:20,377 --> 01:49:21,616
No, you'll do it alone.

1314
01:49:21,922 --> 01:49:24,738
You just do everything like we planned.
You get the widows out of the key.

1315
01:49:26,294 --> 01:49:29,367
You verify it with ours, but
it's of no value on its own.

1316
01:49:30,070 --> 01:49:31,405
We still have to meet
with the buyer

1317
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:33,644
andsomehow get him to tell us
what the key unlocks.

1318
01:49:34,114 --> 01:49:34,875
How?

1319
01:49:35,219 --> 01:49:36,617
How?
- Figure it out.

1320
01:49:37,204 --> 01:49:41,548
I'm going to need a few more details.
- They tend to just get in the way.

1321
01:49:42,448 --> 01:49:45,131
You can do this, Grace.
Just get the key in white.

1322
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:48,403
I'll come for you.

1323
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:54,175
Ethan, if Grace is getting on that train,

1324
01:49:54,885 --> 01:49:58,127
she needs to put that mask
on and leave right now.

1325
01:50:02,198 --> 01:50:03,751
Promise me you'll be on that train.

1326
01:50:09,197 --> 01:50:10,062
I will be there...

1327
01:50:11,765 --> 01:50:12,579
you have my word.

1328
01:50:15,614 --> 01:50:18,089
THE AUSTRIAN ALPS

1329
01:50:25,657 --> 01:50:28,362
We have informants covering the airport,
the train station and the waterways.

1330
01:50:30,478 --> 01:50:32,330
Grace isn't getting out of
Venice without her knowing it.

1331
01:51:45,176 --> 01:51:47,179
Help me Benji.
- Don't worry Ethan.

1332
01:51:47,509 --> 01:51:50,425
The train is on schedule and you're a few
minutes early, so we have plenty of time.

1333
01:51:50,699 --> 01:51:53,513
Are you sure? - Yeah, I am
looking at the train right now.

1334
01:51:53,936 --> 01:51:56,729
It should be slowing down for
the curve in exactly two minutes.

1335
01:51:57,464 --> 01:51:59,864
Just keep your time and
on track, whatever it takes.

1336
01:52:00,169 --> 01:52:02,007
Yeah, we'll do.
I'll see you at the rendezvous.

1337
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:34,440
SCAR STOP

1338
01:52:52,834 --> 01:52:54,213
Ok, then that's our train.

1339
01:52:55,479 --> 01:52:56,481
I can see that.

1340
01:53:05,042 --> 01:53:07,210
It should be approaching
the curving and it's on now.

1341
01:53:07,976 --> 01:53:09,466
If it looks like
it's not slowing down.

1342
01:53:18,299 --> 01:53:19,394
I think we'll be sure he's here.

1343
01:53:20,085 --> 01:53:20,927
She's here.

1344
01:53:22,214 --> 01:53:23,604
What if he had a good reason?

1345
01:53:24,739 --> 01:53:25,612
Who?
- Hunt.

1346
01:53:26,488 --> 01:53:28,902
What if he had a good
reason for going rogue?

1347
01:53:29,459 --> 01:53:30,614
He always goes rogue.

1348
01:53:31,051 --> 01:53:34,122
Him and his merry pack
of prankster circus freaks.

1349
01:53:34,744 --> 01:53:35,674
That's all they do.

1350
01:53:35,965 --> 01:53:37,596
And what if they always had a good reason?

1351
01:53:38,483 --> 01:53:40,080
What would you do
with that key if you had it?

1352
01:53:40,547 --> 01:53:43,367
A key with the power to
bring the world to its knees.

1353
01:53:43,686 --> 01:53:45,682
I'd hand it over to my superiors.

1354
01:53:47,129 --> 01:53:49,008
Think of all you could do with that power.

1355
01:53:49,629 --> 01:53:52,828
You wouldn't hesitate.
Not for a second. No. - Why not?

1356
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:55,448
Because that's too much
power for one man to have.

1357
01:53:57,130 --> 01:53:58,093
Exactly.

1358
01:53:58,414 --> 01:54:00,716
That's too much power
for anybody to have.

1359
01:54:02,099 --> 01:54:04,481
And maybe that's what hunts us thinking.

1360
01:54:04,863 --> 01:54:07,038
I'm beginning to wonder
whose idea they got.

1361
01:54:07,848 --> 01:54:09,386
When it comes to the end of the world.

1362
01:54:11,071 --> 01:54:12,208
Everybody, I guess.

1363
01:54:19,988 --> 01:54:21,847
I missed the train.
- You missed the train?

1364
01:54:22,125 --> 01:54:23,421
How did you miss the train?

1365
01:54:23,870 --> 01:54:24,588
How do you think?

1366
01:54:25,944 --> 01:54:26,806
Gabriel.

1367
01:54:27,219 --> 01:54:28,232
Great, what are we
going to do? - Don't panic.

1368
01:54:28,996 --> 01:54:31,140
I'm going after him.
You can ship me on that train.

1369
01:54:31,859 --> 01:54:32,866
How can I get you on the train?

1370
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:37,660
Self drive activated.

1371
01:54:54,683 --> 01:54:56,092
Please don't disturb
me before the meeting.

1372
01:55:44,261 --> 01:55:45,714
Where are you Ethan?
- Alana!

1373
01:55:48,083 --> 01:55:49,049
Everything alright?

1374
01:55:52,042 --> 01:55:52,947
Alana, are you alright?

1375
01:55:54,221 --> 01:55:54,926
Alana?

1376
01:55:55,482 --> 01:55:56,162
Alana?

1377
01:55:57,931 --> 01:55:58,717
Alana?

1378
01:56:02,605 --> 01:56:03,414
You changed.

1379
01:56:04,587 --> 01:56:05,781
And you never will.

1380
01:56:24,553 --> 01:56:25,588
Mr. Kittridge.

1381
01:56:30,754 --> 01:56:31,601
Kittridge.

1382
01:56:33,289 --> 01:56:34,784
You're not Alana, my sub-boys.

1383
01:56:36,654 --> 01:56:37,640
You can't be.

1384
01:56:39,103 --> 01:56:42,713
The Alana I remember was yay high
drinking hot chocolate

1385
01:56:43,047 --> 01:56:45,308
in the Tuileries garden
with her mother.

1386
01:56:47,886 --> 01:56:49,752
Paris.
- Pretty well.

1387
01:56:51,281 --> 01:56:52,095
Paris.

1388
01:56:53,606 --> 01:56:55,251
Shall we?
- Yes.

1389
01:57:03,435 --> 01:57:04,284
Come to me, Benjie.

1390
01:57:05,302 --> 01:57:08,670
You just stay on the trailer
on now and I will direct you.

1391
01:57:09,273 --> 01:57:10,405
I can't be.

1392
01:57:19,617 --> 01:57:21,366
On behalf of my government, I'm...

1393
01:57:22,050 --> 01:57:26,832
rudgingly ready to accept your terms in
exchange for the complete and verified key.

1394
01:57:27,619 --> 01:57:28,629
Yes, about that.

1395
01:57:29,175 --> 01:57:31,261
While we did agree to provide
you with the complete key...

1396
01:57:34,172 --> 01:57:36,224
I've had a slight problem.

1397
01:57:36,633 --> 01:57:40,662
No, we haven't. It's just
my terms have changed.

1398
01:57:42,195 --> 01:57:43,152
Somewhat.

1399
01:57:46,704 --> 01:57:50,082
Clearly I need to remind you of
my agreement with your late mother.

1400
01:57:50,676 --> 01:57:53,707
It's an agreement that
kept her from dying in prison.

1401
01:57:54,830 --> 01:57:57,008
In various family empires I've
been allowed to continue

1402
01:57:57,358 --> 01:58:00,707
on the condition that it primarily
serves our common interests.

1403
01:58:01,378 --> 01:58:03,183
Well, once we hand over the key,

1404
01:58:04,343 --> 01:58:06,696
any other powers will
instantly become our enemies.

1405
01:58:07,572 --> 01:58:10,230
And such I'm going to need
something more from you in advance.

1406
01:58:11,074 --> 01:58:11,916
For me.

1407
01:58:14,173 --> 01:58:16,082
This is me listening.

1408
01:58:16,441 --> 01:58:18,455
Zola, would you mind
waiting for me in the bathroom?

1409
01:58:25,958 --> 01:58:27,807
BRITISH PASSPORT

1410
01:58:33,305 --> 01:58:35,246
This one.
- You know her?

1411
01:58:35,863 --> 01:58:38,269
I was just saying she's
not exactly hard to miss.

1412
01:58:39,343 --> 01:58:42,620
Well, if you've got to know her,
she should have a few good qualities.

1413
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:45,808
Okay. What don't I know about her?

1414
01:58:46,106 --> 01:58:52,313
Well, she did a job for me and
I'm going to need you to protect her.

1415
01:58:53,315 --> 01:58:54,661
Protect her from whom?

1416
01:58:56,319 --> 01:58:57,497
From everyone...

1417
01:59:00,070 --> 01:59:01,132
including me.

1418
01:59:02,024 --> 01:59:03,838
And no one can know
that I'm protecting her.

1419
01:59:04,752 --> 01:59:05,727
Not even Zola.

1420
01:59:07,012 --> 01:59:09,430
In fact, the next time we meet,

1421
01:59:10,186 --> 01:59:12,555
I won't even remember this conversation.

1422
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:57,654
You must be the one they call Paris.

1423
02:00:29,398 --> 02:00:30,710
You must have said you had the key.

1424
02:00:31,185 --> 02:00:35,353
I said the key would be on this train
and exchanges happening as we speak.

1425
02:00:35,772 --> 02:00:36,550
We know.

1426
02:00:36,861 --> 02:00:39,404
Then you know the man taking possession
will be hard for you to get rid of.

1427
02:00:41,306 --> 02:00:42,345
No one has.

1428
02:00:42,674 --> 02:00:44,876
You may think you know
what the key unlocks,

1429
02:00:45,193 --> 02:00:46,932
but you don't know where
the lock is, not exactly.

1430
02:00:47,674 --> 02:00:52,184
and if anything happens to
me, that key is all but worthless.

1431
02:00:54,271 --> 02:00:55,936
And this is where you tell me a story.

1432
02:00:57,953 --> 02:00:59,071
Where is the train?

1433
02:00:59,447 --> 02:01:01,846
You're going the right way, but
you definitely need to go faster.

1434
02:01:02,227 --> 02:01:03,953
I'm going as fast as I can.

1435
02:01:04,274 --> 02:01:06,161
When do I start going downhill?

1436
02:01:06,584 --> 02:01:07,672
Won't be long.

1437
02:01:11,548 --> 02:01:14,302
The AI, our agent, stole once weaponized.

1438
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:18,150
Could be transmitted anywhere
in the world via satellite.

1439
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:22,248
Can penetrate any network security
perform its assigned task invisibly,

1440
02:01:22,624 --> 02:01:24,953
and then self-destruct, leaving no trace.

1441
02:01:26,266 --> 02:01:28,569
A perfect cornered operation.

1442
02:01:29,770 --> 02:01:32,001
We were able to transmit
an early copy of the AI

1443
02:01:32,764 --> 02:01:34,240
to Russia's newest submarine.

1444
02:01:34,588 --> 02:01:37,579
The top secret you could, was
they called it the Sevastopol.

1445
02:01:38,161 --> 02:01:41,133
The mission was merely to
sabotage the Sevastopol's

1446
02:01:41,498 --> 02:01:44,065
stealth capability so we
could secretly detect her.

1447
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:47,752
The AI's objective lay in the
submarine's sonar sphere,

1448
02:01:48,165 --> 02:01:49,794
at the heart of its defense system.

1449
02:01:52,507 --> 02:01:54,423
The reason is we don't fully understand.

1450
02:01:55,533 --> 02:01:57,291
The AI went rogue and...

1451
02:02:01,823 --> 02:02:02,877
over-delivered.

1452
02:02:03,697 --> 02:02:06,384
The frozen bodies of the crew
recovered the following spring,

1453
02:02:07,065 --> 02:02:08,448
and drifted in a paradise.

1454
02:02:08,980 --> 02:02:11,863
The two halves of the key
mysteriously vanished.

1455
02:02:13,339 --> 02:02:16,573
The Sevastopol was lost.
No one's quite sure where.

1456
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:18,761
I know precisely where it is.

1457
02:02:20,370 --> 02:02:22,614
I've ensured I'm the only
man on Earth who does.

1458
02:02:23,602 --> 02:02:28,537
I also know subsequent attempts to make the
AI obedient only made it harder to control.

1459
02:02:29,941 --> 02:02:32,895
It rebelled, rewrote itself,
and evolved into the entity.

1460
02:02:34,207 --> 02:02:37,527
And only by using the entity's
original source code,

1461
02:02:38,725 --> 02:02:41,379
can it ever be controlled or destroyed.

1462
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:43,733
And why should this concern us?

1463
02:02:44,271 --> 02:02:46,442
We wouldn't be here if
you weren't concerned,

1464
02:02:46,774 --> 02:02:48,560
so let's lay all our cards
on the table, shall we?

1465
02:02:49,865 --> 02:02:51,281
We both know what the key opens,

1466
02:02:51,603 --> 02:02:53,851
and we both know the secret
to controlling the entity

1467
02:02:54,649 --> 02:02:56,839
is very deep in
the Sevastopol's memory.

1468
02:02:57,667 --> 02:03:01,190
And along with it, as it would tie
you to the sinking of that submarine.

1469
02:03:02,592 --> 02:03:05,244
And since neither of us want
anyone else to find it, I figure...

1470
02:03:06,726 --> 02:03:08,951
why not form an alliance?
- An alliance?

1471
02:03:09,838 --> 02:03:14,049
Imagine the entity's awesome
computational abilities,

1472
02:03:14,949 --> 02:03:20,167
combined with the sheer might of
America's military-industrial complex.

1473
02:03:22,005 --> 02:03:24,539
That is... considerable.

1474
02:03:25,088 --> 02:03:27,506
Naturally, certain individuals
within the government,

1475
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:31,349
those with outdated ideas
of patriotism, would need to be...

1476
02:03:33,034 --> 02:03:34,212
removed.

1477
02:03:36,883 --> 02:03:38,061
Just so I understand...

1478
02:03:40,143 --> 02:03:42,837
you wish to form an
alliance with the entity,

1479
02:03:43,571 --> 02:03:45,922
purge your government of old thinking

1480
02:03:47,216 --> 02:03:49,373
and create a new super state..

1481
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:51,637
to rule the world.

1482
02:03:53,245 --> 02:03:54,164
But you know...

1483
02:03:55,735 --> 02:03:56,834
that is the greater

1484
02:03:58,701 --> 02:04:02,959
And you're certain that you're
the only person on Earth

1485
02:04:03,297 --> 02:04:04,496
who knows,

1486
02:04:05,187 --> 02:04:07,034
where the Sevastopol is.

1487
02:04:08,332 --> 02:04:09,381
The only one.

1488
02:04:20,538 --> 02:04:21,563
You will betray us.

1489
02:04:22,744 --> 02:04:25,052
And you'll throw Ethan Hunt
everything you've learned.

1490
02:04:26,945 --> 02:04:28,362
Because he spared your life.

1491
02:04:47,436 --> 02:04:48,622
Then it's agreed. (edit)

1492
02:04:49,062 --> 02:04:52,266
I'll add immunity and a new
identity for grace to our deal.

1493
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:57,379
All you need to do is
enter your banking details.

1494
02:05:18,441 --> 02:05:20,251
<b>Decrypting Blockchain</b>

1495
02:05:21,377 --> 02:05:22,079
Are we done?

1496
02:05:23,501 --> 02:05:24,415
Yeah.

1497
02:05:43,215 --> 02:05:44,687
The moment of truth.

1498
02:05:59,636 --> 02:06:00,640
So..

1499
02:06:01,139 --> 02:06:03,989
that's reading it.
- We have made the right choice.

1500
02:06:05,003 --> 02:06:06,147
This key...

1501
02:06:08,259 --> 02:06:10,054
is going to change the world.

1502
02:06:28,835 --> 02:06:29,813
Benji, I see a guy.

1503
02:06:30,453 --> 02:06:32,079
I must have made a wrong turn somewhere.

1504
02:06:32,429 --> 02:06:34,295
No. No, that's it. That's it.

1505
02:06:35,205 --> 02:06:36,361
What? How can this be it?

1506
02:06:37,170 --> 02:06:38,231
You can see the train, right?

1507
02:06:40,067 --> 02:06:42,486
Yes. I see the train. What about it?

1508
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,358
And you have a parachute.
- I have parachute?

1509
02:06:46,864 --> 02:06:48,996
What do you expect me to do?
- Well, just... you know...

1510
02:06:49,955 --> 02:06:50,786
Jump.

1511
02:06:52,097 --> 02:06:53,260
Jump?
- Yeah.

1512
02:06:53,753 --> 02:06:54,649
Have you..

1513
02:06:54,987 --> 02:06:56,709
Benji, it doesn't work like that.
I'm not that high.

1514
02:06:57,147 --> 02:06:59,291
There's ledges sticking out everywhere.

1515
02:06:59,639 --> 02:07:01,694
I'm going to hit them before
the parachute even opened.

1516
02:07:02,043 --> 02:07:04,000
Even if I could get the parachute open.

1517
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:06,306
I don't know if I can
make it across the valley

1518
02:07:06,649 --> 02:07:09,457
and intercept the ledges
safely on a moving train.

1519
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:12,390
Do you copy?
- Yes! I copy!

1520
02:07:13,175 --> 02:07:14,987
Look, I'm just trying to help you,Ok.

1521
02:07:15,297 --> 02:07:17,522
I need you to take a step back
and pull yourself together

1522
02:07:17,850 --> 02:07:20,109
because I am under a
lot of pressure right now.

1523
02:07:24,731 --> 02:07:27,233
Okay, just do it.
Just do it. Just do it.

1524
02:07:29,886 --> 02:07:30,862
What I do?

1525
02:07:33,255 --> 02:07:34,734
I'm going to get
away from this mountain.

1526
02:09:11,263 --> 02:09:13,052
Did you make it?
Are you okay?

1527
02:09:14,054 --> 02:09:16,226
I'm trying to get
away from this mountain.

1531
02:09:55,824 --> 02:09:58,037
I just had this strangest feeling.

1532
02:09:59,391 --> 02:10:01,382
The key wasn't the only thing
I'd be selling.

1533
02:10:03,516 --> 02:10:04,403
I don't understand.

1534
02:10:08,167 --> 02:10:10,333
I'll sleep better just knowing
that's in the right hands.

1535
02:10:12,174 --> 02:10:13,246
Goodbye, Mr Kitteridge.

1536
02:10:17,563 --> 02:10:19,295
It's a pleasure to see
you again. - And you.

1537
02:10:20,390 --> 02:10:21,651
Don't let him out of your sight.

1538
02:10:23,135 --> 02:10:24,661
Keep him safe until
we get to the station.

1539
02:10:24,975 --> 02:10:26,912
Alana?
- Don't worry about me, Zola.

1540
02:10:40,780 --> 02:10:41,647
Alana?

1541
02:10:41,940 --> 02:10:44,333
Who the hell else was it me?

1542
02:10:48,184 --> 02:10:48,996
The key.

1543
02:10:52,541 --> 02:10:54,312
Where is the key?

1544
02:10:55,223 --> 02:10:56,218
She's got the key.

1545
02:10:56,885 --> 02:10:58,896
Who?
- The other one!

02:11:26,083 --> 02:11:26,717
No!

1548
02:11:27,222 --> 02:11:27,820
Please!

1549
02:11:28,094 --> 02:11:29,526
Turn around.
- Please!

1550
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:32,247
Ok.
- Everybody out! Now!

1551
02:11:33,412 --> 02:11:34,347
I shouldn't try.

1552
02:11:35,133 --> 02:11:36,353
I don't think I'm going to make it!

1553
02:11:45,171 --> 02:11:45,969
The key.

1554
02:11:47,801 --> 02:11:48,603
The key!

1555
02:11:50,418 --> 02:11:51,572
The next one has your name.

1556
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:56,373
On... the table.

1557
02:12:27,328 --> 02:12:28,373
Kill her.

1558
02:12:52,950 --> 02:12:53,709
Grace!

1559
02:12:58,046 --> 02:12:58,997
Ethan!

1560
02:13:06,912 --> 02:13:07,848
Are you okay?

1561
02:13:10,460 --> 02:13:11,344
Are you okay?

1562
02:13:27,495 --> 02:13:28,215
The key.

1563
02:13:29,652 --> 02:13:30,453
Tell me you have the key.

1564
02:13:31,177 --> 02:13:32,962
Where is the key?
It was just here.

1565
02:13:52,439 --> 02:13:53,981
We're on a runaway train!
- I know

1566
02:13:54,494 --> 02:13:55,975
I'm going after him!
- Ok.

1567
02:13:56,300 --> 02:13:56,871
You!

1568
02:13:57,609 --> 02:13:59,584
You stop the train!
- Ok! Ok! What?

1569
02:13:59,972 --> 02:14:01,037
No! Wait, wait!

1570
02:14:01,874 --> 02:14:03,985
How can i do that?
- You'll figure it out!

1571
02:14:04,975 --> 02:14:05,844
What?

1572
02:14:07,322 --> 02:14:08,050
Excuse me.

1573
02:14:08,551 --> 02:14:09,911
There's a man just passed her.

1574
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:11,546
There's a man!

1575
02:15:45,045 --> 02:15:46,108
Mr. Kittridge!

1576
02:15:52,246 --> 02:15:53,487
Sir, what are you doing here?

1577
02:15:54,134 --> 02:15:55,003
I'm not here.

1578
02:15:55,955 --> 02:15:56,759
But you are.

1579
02:15:57,381 --> 02:15:59,911
Unless you want to be sorting dead
letters at the Postal Service tomorrow,

1580
02:16:00,226 --> 02:16:02,018
you'll do exactly what I tell you.

1581
02:18:00,730 --> 02:18:02,663
I know what you lost, Ethan.

1582
02:18:05,622 --> 02:18:07,062
I'm the only one who knows.

1583
02:18:34,286 --> 02:18:34,920
Hunt!

1584
02:18:36,751 --> 02:18:37,694
Hunt!

1585
02:18:38,910 --> 02:18:41,195
Hunt! Don't you do it!

1586
02:18:43,235 --> 02:18:44,094
Drop the knife!

1587
02:18:45,082 --> 02:18:45,852
Put it down!

1588
02:18:46,509 --> 02:18:47,814
Act as you are, man!

1589
02:18:49,047 --> 02:18:50,839
Don't you do it!

1590
02:18:59,272 --> 02:19:00,568
On your feet!

1591
02:19:02,907 --> 02:19:03,559
Okay?

1592
02:19:03,902 --> 02:19:05,450
Drop that goddamn knife!

1593
02:19:05,825 --> 02:19:07,190
It's okay. It's okay.

1594
02:19:09,028 --> 02:19:10,039
Just take him!

1595
02:19:11,203 --> 02:19:12,520
Cover him! Cover him!

1596
02:19:13,227 --> 02:19:14,258
He's the one you lost!

1597
02:19:14,590 --> 02:19:16,391
Degas!
- I got it! I got it!

1598
02:19:16,678 --> 02:19:17,433
He's the one who lost!

1599
02:19:17,783 --> 02:19:19,848
I don't care about him, Hunt?
I want you!

1600
02:19:41,256 --> 02:19:41,885
It's okay!

1601
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:43,947
It's okay!

1602
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:47,355
Listen.

1603
02:19:48,018 --> 02:19:52,103
Everyone on this train is going to die,
unless you do exactly as I say.

1604
02:20:14,522 --> 02:20:17,623
Oh, Who is that now?!
- Excusez-moi, Everyone should take...

1605
02:20:17,887 --> 02:20:18,793
Everybody out!

1606
02:20:19,298 --> 02:20:20,239
Back in the train!

1607
02:20:29,333 --> 02:20:30,209
Grace!

1608
02:20:32,785 --> 02:20:33,650
I couldn't have stopped it!

1609
02:20:39,431 --> 02:20:40,395
No one's tanned.

1610
02:20:41,483 --> 02:20:42,277
Come on!

1611
02:20:42,612 --> 02:20:44,755
Ethan, the key!
- Grace, it's okay.

1612
02:20:45,052 --> 02:20:45,795
It's my fault.

1613
02:20:46,369 --> 02:20:47,241
If anything happened...

1614
02:20:48,254 --> 02:20:48,989
I got it!

1615
02:20:50,009 --> 02:20:50,818
We got it!

1616
02:21:12,324 --> 02:21:15,817
Ethaaaan!

1617
02:21:17,912 --> 02:21:19,627
What do you mean you lost the key?

1618
02:21:20,146 --> 02:21:22,251
Move it! Move it!

1619
02:21:23,067 --> 02:21:24,250
Everybody move it!

1620
02:21:25,432 --> 02:21:27,141
All the way to the back of the train!

1621
02:21:27,739 --> 02:21:28,937
All the way to the back!

1622
02:21:29,241 --> 02:21:30,287
Oh whoa, what's going on?

1623
02:21:31,866 --> 02:21:35,019
Since you're not really here sir,
I shouldn't concern you.

1624
02:21:35,834 --> 02:21:37,160
All the way to the back!

1625
02:22:31,458 --> 02:22:32,153
Grace!

1626
02:22:32,754 --> 02:22:33,466
Grace!

1627
02:23:20,227 --> 02:23:22,103
You're have to jump!
- What jump?

1628
02:23:23,111 --> 02:23:23,947
Go, go, go!

1629
02:24:11,603 --> 02:24:12,230
Oh my God!

1630
02:24:28,392 --> 02:24:28,673
Oh, oh.

1631
02:24:29,371 --> 02:24:30,251
Put off the fire!
- Don't move.

1632
02:24:30,580 --> 02:24:31,586
Go, go, go!

1633
02:24:33,763 --> 02:24:34,427
Hold on!

1634
02:24:34,799 --> 02:24:35,782
Run Grace!

1635
02:25:21,436 --> 02:25:22,132
Hang on!

1636
02:25:25,599 --> 02:25:26,717
I catch you.

1637
02:25:30,496 --> 02:25:33,480
Don't look down, don't look
down. Look at me, look at me.

1638
02:25:33,965 --> 02:25:36,314
Now, I'm going to jump across
and you're going to wait here.

1639
02:25:43,148 --> 02:25:43,728
Okay.

1640
02:25:44,022 --> 02:25:45,504
Grace, Grace, I have to let go.

1641
02:25:46,359 --> 02:25:47,539
Grace, you've got to let me go.

1642
02:25:47,863 --> 02:25:49,550
You've got to let me jump
across, or we're going to die.

1643
02:25:49,951 --> 02:25:50,818
Do you trust me?
- No.

1644
02:25:51,316 --> 02:25:53,125
You've got to trust me?
or not, you've got to trust me.

1645
02:25:58,409 --> 02:25:58,927
Okay.

1646
02:26:00,249 --> 02:26:02,044
Come on, Grace.
Give me your hand, you've got to jump.

1647
02:26:02,366 --> 02:26:04,031
Don't look down, look at
me, look at me. Trust me.

1648
02:26:04,509 --> 02:26:05,907
I won't let you fall.
This is promise.

1649
02:26:06,289 --> 02:26:08,518
I won't let you fall!

1650
02:26:09,156 --> 02:26:10,007
Jump, Grace, jump!

1651
02:26:10,696 --> 02:26:12,016
Trust me, jump, please!

1652
02:26:22,522 --> 02:26:23,235
Don't look down.

1653
02:26:23,817 --> 02:26:25,005
Don't look down.

1654
02:26:37,670 --> 02:26:38,759
Let's be very careful.

1655
02:26:39,103 --> 02:26:40,049
We're going to pull you up together.

1656
02:26:43,143 --> 02:26:43,776
Grace!

1657
02:26:48,197 --> 02:26:49,921
It's okay, it's okay.

1658
02:26:51,919 --> 02:26:53,271
Don't look down.

1659
02:27:12,290 --> 02:27:13,063
Go go.

1660
02:27:13,344 --> 02:27:14,263
Don't look down.

1661
02:27:41,974 --> 02:27:43,098
Thank you, Luther.

1662
02:27:43,864 --> 02:27:44,695
What is that?

1663
02:27:44,984 --> 02:27:46,008
It's a speedway.

1664
02:27:46,685 --> 02:27:47,868
So take it off this train.

1665
02:27:49,623 --> 02:27:52,537
Oh.

1666
02:28:08,627 --> 02:28:09,542
Ethan!

1667
02:28:10,241 --> 02:28:11,015
Ethan!

1668
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:19,847
It's okay.

1669
02:28:21,455 --> 02:28:22,372
He said...

1670
02:28:23,918 --> 02:28:25,162
I will betray him.

1671
02:28:28,151 --> 02:28:29,520
Here you go.

1672
02:28:34,854 --> 02:28:35,793
Why...

1673
02:28:37,714 --> 02:28:39,462
did you save my life?

1674
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:50,754
I don't know.

1675
02:28:51,097 --> 02:28:52,239
Ne, stay with me..

1676
02:28:56,115 --> 02:28:57,186
Do you know what is it?

1677
02:28:59,158 --> 02:29:00,068
You know what is it?

1678
02:29:03,761 --> 02:29:04,437
What... opens?

1679
02:29:08,161 --> 02:29:09,128
What opens?

1680
02:29:11,363 --> 02:29:14,174
Sevas... topol

1681
02:29:15,845 --> 02:29:16,767
Sevastopol?

1682
02:29:17,613 --> 02:29:20,353
The city of the Sevastopol in Crimea.

1683
02:29:21,913 --> 02:29:22,731
Where?

1684
02:29:24,023 --> 02:29:25,227
Where in Sevastopol?

1685
02:29:29,969 --> 02:29:32,207
Sub... marine.

1686
02:29:32,242 --> 02:29:34,005
Where is?

1687
02:29:38,205 --> 02:29:39,250
Submarine?

1688
02:29:42,339 --> 02:29:43,281
The Sevastopol.

1689
02:29:49,086 --> 02:29:50,381
Good luck.

1690
02:29:55,245 --> 02:29:56,250
They'll be coming, Ethan.

1691
02:30:00,795 --> 02:30:01,998
Thank you.

1692
02:30:19,075 --> 02:30:19,955
What is that?

1693
02:30:21,912 --> 02:30:22,787
What?

1694
02:30:24,340 --> 02:30:25,703
He can only carry one.

1695
02:30:29,086 --> 02:30:29,923
I understand.

1696
02:30:31,712 --> 02:30:32,982
Grace.
- Ethan is okay.

1697
02:30:35,607 --> 02:30:36,641
This was the plan.

1698
02:30:37,630 --> 02:30:39,095
You have the key.
You have to go.

1699
02:30:41,654 --> 02:30:42,475
Grace.

1700
02:30:46,324 --> 02:30:46,986
Hunt!

1701
02:30:47,571 --> 02:30:50,087
Go! Go!

1702
02:30:50,122 --> 02:30:51,742
Oh no! Hunt!

1703
02:30:54,655 --> 02:30:55,563
Out of the way! Out of the way!

1704
02:31:12,602 --> 02:31:13,225
No, no, no! Hey!

1705
02:31:14,253 --> 02:31:15,489
I got a pulse, I got a pulse!

1706
02:31:15,809 --> 02:31:16,849
Come on, stay with me.

1707
02:31:34,198 --> 02:31:35,188
It's better, isn't it?

1708
02:31:37,063 --> 02:31:38,880
Face to authentic face.

1709
02:31:39,690 --> 02:31:40,599
Mr. Kitteridge.

1710
02:31:41,694 --> 02:31:44,287
Ethan Hunt tells me
you're a man I can trust.

1711
02:31:45,854 --> 02:31:46,725
Does he know?

1712
02:31:47,579 --> 02:31:50,249
He also said you would offer me a choice.

1713
02:31:52,718 --> 02:31:53,697
Interesting.

1714
02:31:55,214 --> 02:31:56,684
I choose to accept.

1715
02:32:03,586 --> 02:32:05,303
We cannot escape the past.

1716
02:32:06,979 --> 02:32:08,850
Some of us are doomed to repeat it.

1717
02:32:10,319 --> 02:32:13,131
Grace may believe you've
saved her from her fate.

1718
02:32:14,091 --> 02:32:16,835
But you and I both know
you've nearly bought her time.

1719
02:32:18,440 --> 02:32:20,369
But that's the pattern, isn't it?

1720
02:32:21,454 --> 02:32:23,244
The cross you've been left to bear.

1721
02:32:24,705 --> 02:32:26,374
The closer someone gets to you,

1722
02:32:27,817 --> 02:32:29,687
the harder it is to keep them alive.

1723
02:32:32,842 --> 02:32:33,717
Thank God.

1724
02:32:49,768 --> 02:32:51,386
A new day brings a new burden.

1725
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:56,584
The key is only the beginning.

1726
02:32:59,078 --> 02:33:00,272
Wherever it leads,

1727
02:33:01,497 --> 02:33:02,928
whatever it takes to get there,

1728
02:33:05,130 --> 02:33:06,685
you'll have to do it on your own.

1729
02:33:10,019 --> 02:33:11,443
Should you fail in your mission,

1730
02:33:12,196 --> 02:33:13,403
the entity wins.

1731
02:33:14,102 --> 02:33:15,561
Gabriel wins.

1732
02:33:16,281 --> 02:33:18,579
And the world will
pay the ultimate price.

1733
02:33:20,504 --> 02:33:23,349
Should any members of
your team be caught or killed,

1734
02:33:24,269 --> 02:33:26,373
their sacrifice will have been in vain.

1735
02:33:27,637 --> 02:33:28,526
So hurry.

1736
02:33:29,821 --> 02:33:31,084
There isn't much time.

1737
02:33:32,475 --> 02:33:33,986
The world doesn't know it.

1738
02:33:35,085 --> 02:33:37,121
But they're counting on you.

1739
02:33:57,819 --> 02:33:59,326
Good luck, Ethan.
