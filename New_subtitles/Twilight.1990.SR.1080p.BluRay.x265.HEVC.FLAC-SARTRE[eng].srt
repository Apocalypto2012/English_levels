TWILIGHT
a film by György Fehér

5
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,083
I'm very sorry.

6
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:58,708
That I have to bother you with this
filthy business

7
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,875
in your last days.

8
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,625
I don't even know who will replace you.

9
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,042
Greetings, Inspector.

10
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,125
By the cross up there.

11
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:43,042
A girl, about 8 years old.

12
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,292
Most likely been dead for days.

13
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,958
- How was she killed?
- With a razor.

14
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,917
Had you sent the child somewhere?

15
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,833
Did she often take that route?

16
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,083
The girl was found dead in the forest.

17
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,583
She has been murdered.

18
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:10,917
My child...

19
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,875
I need... need to... go...

20
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:17,833
Go... to her...

21
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,208
to see my child...

22
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,458
Need to go see my child...

23
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,250
- Who killed her? Who killed her?
- My child... I must see her...

24
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:27,958
- My child... My child...
- Who killed her? Who killed her!

25
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,083
- I have to go and see her!
- Who killed her?! Who killed her?!

26
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,167
- You can't go there!
- Who killed her?!

27
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,708
- Don't you understand...
- Who killed her?!

28
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,917
- You cannot go there...
- Who killed her?!

29
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:43,583
- Who killed her...?
- Who killed her!

30
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,625
- I don't know...
- You must find out...

31
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,167
I beg you...

32
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,125
- You need to find out...
- I will...

33
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:53,125
- I beg you... Find out...
- Twill... will...

34
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,375
- Find out...
- I promise... I promise...

35
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,875
Do something already...

36
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,375
I've already tried.

37
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,667
They won't listen to me.

38
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:35,292
These people... They want the hawker.

39
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,958
You were the one who found the child?

40
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes, I did, Inspector.

41
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,500
You know what those outside want?

42
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,750
Yes, I do, Inspector.

43
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:17,958
Do you know why?

44
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,208
Because you've been involved
in a similar case before.

45
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,917
I am innocent, Inspector.

46
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,375
I'll say, you go together nicely...

47
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,958
He hasn't been arrested...

48
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,375
He's being interviewed as a witness...

49
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,125
Your job is...

50
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,208
whether he's guilty or not...

51
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,500
order must be maintained here.

52
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,458
If freedom of movement is
not guaranteed here,

53
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,458
everyone will suffer.

54
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,833
It is your job, is it not, to maintain
order,

55
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,958
to ensure the investigation runs
uninterrupted!

56
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,958
Go out there...

57
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,833
and tell them to go about their business!!

58
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,125
So what was the story with Anna?

59
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,750
Look me in the eye.

60
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,083
What was the story with Anna?

61
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,333
The giant...

62
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:43,917
He met Anna every week.

63
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
And...?

64
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:55,167
Look me in the eye...

65
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,750
Where?

66
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,833
By the cross.

67
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,292
Look me in the eye...

68
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,917
- Are you sure Anna drew the giant?
- Yes.

69
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:39,167
- And have you seen the giant yourself?
- Not me, unfortunately.

70
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:48,000
- Where did she meet the giant?
- By the cross.

71
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,792
And what did the giant give to Anna?

72
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,375
Little hedgehogs.

73
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:57,083
- Look me in the eye...
- Little hedgehogs.

74
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:02,792
He gave her little hedgehogs.

75
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:10,958
- Where?
- By the cross.

76
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:16,458
Are you sure she drew the giant?

77
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,792
Professor...

78
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:10,583
He doesn't strike me as a sex killer.

79
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:37,083
Has he been previously convicted
of sexual assault?

80
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:44,708
He was with a 14-year-old girl.

81
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:08,792
And his relations?
With other women?

82
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,958
Well... Just like any other hawker...

83
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:25,375
He's been around...

84
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,667
Higgledy-piggledy...

85
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:45,917
Too bad she died...

86
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:13,083
But the car, on the other hand...

87
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:18,042
she seems to have observed pretty closely.

88
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:22,583
So much so...

89
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:29,083
that I could perhaps even say...

90
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:39,083
that the car in question might
well be an old-fashioned one.

91
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:51,958
This, of course, is only a vague
assumption, however.

92
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:05,292
Because, if it were true...

93
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:22,250
then the murderer...

94
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:31,250
is still driving about in
an old-fashioned car.

95
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:43,292
Let us say for the sake of argument,

96
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:46,583
that I identified the child's murderer
from this drawing.

97
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:56,208
If we accept this as a possible scenario...

98
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,000
whatever could we make of this, you and I?

99
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,167
You, Sir...

100
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,583
are trying to do the impossible...

101
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:21,667
But if you...

102
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:30,667
wanted to chase a murderer now...

103
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,833
who most likely does not exist...

104
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,875
but even if he did...

105
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:06,458
You will never find him...

106
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,833
because of this kind of murderer

107
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:20,625
does not kill by accident...

108
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,583
There are too many.

109
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:42,917
Well,

110
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:49,167
then your situation would
get very worrisome.

111
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,000
So, you said

112
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:44,500
that you went into the
forest after your break,

113
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:48,250
before you returned to the city,

114
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:59,708
and you stumbled across the body...

115
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:08,417
without touching said body.

116
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:23,333
We took your clothes and gave you new ones.

117
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,917
Do you suspect why?

118
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,375
We found bloodstains on your coat.

119
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:38,042
The little girl's blood.

120
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:50,833
I stumbled on the body.

121
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:57,500
And I assume you only kept
this quiet out of fear?

122
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:08,875
And you want us to believe you again?

123
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,958
No need to get anxious...

124
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,833
We don't want to torture you.

125
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:35,292
We're only working to bring
the truth to light.

126
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:38,042
That's why we've turned to you.

127
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:41,792
You are our most important witness.
You have to help us.

128
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:44,708
Yes, Inspector.

129
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:49,250
Tell me, what sorts of things
do you sell?

130
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:51,083
Towels?

131
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,875
Tea-towels, too.

132
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,458
What else?

133
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:02,875
Shoelaces...

134
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,458
Inspector.

135
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:08,667
Toothbrushes.

136
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,708
Soap.

137
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:16,083
Shaving cream.

138
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,208
Is that all?

139
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:20,375
Well, now...

140
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:22,667
I think you've forgotten something.

141
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,292
Go on now, what else do you sell?

142
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:30,042
We've gone through your stuff
very thoroughly.

143
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:32,417
Well?

144
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:45,083
- Kitchen knives.
- What else?

145
00:42:46,042 --> 00:42:48,458
What else besides the kitchen knives?

146
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:16,250
Razors.

147
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,542
Why did you hesitate to tell us?

148
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:32,042
The girl... was killed with a razorblade.

149
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,667
Look, I know that you
committed this murder.

150
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:43,125
But I also know...

151
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:47,458
that you were just as
shocked by it as I am.

152
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,750
As we all are.

153
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:52,583
Something came over you
that turned you into an animal.

154
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:55,792
You attacked her and killed her
without intending to.

155
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,500
Something inside you,
a compulsion you couldn't control...

156
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:04,125
You ran to the village to turn yourself in
but on the way you got scared.

157
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:05,625
Isn't that right?

158
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:20,167
I'm tired.

159
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:23,958
We're all tired.

160
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:28,333
Send for coffee,

161
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,125
and later, beer.

162
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,958
For our guest, too.

163
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,292
We are the police...
we're humane.

164
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:48,292
I am innocent, Inspector.

165
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,458
Yes?

166
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,792
Tell me, what did you have
for lunch that day?

167
00:45:14,292 --> 00:45:16,042
Stuffed beef.

168
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:20,125
With braised cabbage.

169
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:27,292
You hawkers seem to do well.

170
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,333
Did you eat anything else?

171
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,458
When did you have the chocolate?

172
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:38,667
A report from the Coroner's Office.

173
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,625
The autopsy revealed
chocolate in the child's stomach.

174
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,792
He jumped off the upper floor.

175
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:14,708
Please, allow me to take over this case.

176
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:17,750
I don't think the murderer
is from around here.

177
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:22,417
It must be the same person responsible
for those other murders in the north.

178
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:24,750
Someone with a car.

179
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:26,875
Most likely a salesman or traveller.

180
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:29,708
I cannot agree to this.

181
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:32,125
You're not with us anymore.

182
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:58,750
Surely you're not going to just
wait for something to happen?

183
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:04,042
Something that might never happen?

184
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:17,875
And you would just wait and wait?

185
00:56:22,708 --> 00:56:25,583
You shouldn't have taken it
to heart, you know.

186
00:56:28,458 --> 00:56:31,375
Wouldn't you consider coming back to us?

187
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,583
First you'd need to do internal service.

188
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:39,792
The usual conditions.

189
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:46,625
Perhaps they would even take
you back in the city police.

190
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:56,208
Looking at all this here...

191
00:56:57,208 --> 00:57:01,125
you should consider it, even if
just for purely financial reasons.

192
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:33,042
What a pretty little creature.

193
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:36,667
Do they know why they're here?

194
01:03:39,667 --> 01:03:40,958
Dear God...

195
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:42,292
Can't...

196
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,792
Can't take it anymore...

197
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:51,708
I can't take it...

198
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:54,417
I don't want this anymore...

199
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:57,333
I don't want this anymore,
do you hear me?

200
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,792
I can't take it, I don't want to!
I'm leaving!

201
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,167
Say something, you!

202
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:06,167
You said you'd stop drinking!

203
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,958
You said you'd stop drinking,
can you hear me?

204
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:10,833
I can't take it anymore,
you hear me?

205
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:13,458
This is not what you promised,
you filthy scum!

206
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,583
Not what you promised,
you filth... you vermin...

207
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:19,792
You filthy garbage, I'll show you...

208
01:04:21,542 --> 01:04:22,583
Leave me...

209
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:26,042
Let me go you filthy scum!

210
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,167
You filth, you...

211
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:29,667
You'll wake the kid...

212
01:04:29,667 --> 01:04:31,042
God...

213
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:34,208
Let me go you filth...

214
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:37,750
Is this what you wanted me for?
You filth...

215
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,167
Let me go you scum...

216
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:42,667
Help me, God...

217
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:47,667
Leave me...

218
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,792
Filth...

219
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:53,292
Stop...
Enough...

220
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:55,542
Don't want to...

221
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:57,417
You filth, you...

222
01:04:57,875 --> 01:04:58,958
Urgh!

223
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:00,667
Urgh, you disgust me!

224
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:12,083
The child...

225
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,542
Don't!

226
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:52,042
This is not what you promised...

227
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:49,125
Who gave you chocolate?

228
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:55,250
A girl.

229
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,208
At school?

230
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:07,083
Right, show me.

231
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:15,083
And is there any more?

232
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:18,875
Hm?

233
01:13:18,917 --> 01:13:20,917
How about in your pockets?

234
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:48,000
Was it the wizard who gave you these?

235
01:13:50,333 --> 01:13:51,542
Hm?

236
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:06,292
Did he forbid you to talk about
the two of you?

237
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:18,083
Well then, don't!

238
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,250
He's a good wizard of the forest.

239
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:36,458
You can visit him anytime you want to.

240
01:14:44,042 --> 01:14:45,875
Now go back to play.

241
01:18:30,292 --> 01:18:31,542
Go away.

242
01:18:58,792 --> 01:19:02,500
I ask you kindly not to hinder
me in doing my duty,

243
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:04,667
which is to uncover the truth.

244
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:09,958
Go away.

245
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:16,708
Please don't do anything you
would regret later.

246
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:27,083
I beg you, please, go away.

247
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:35,583
You wouldn't if you were in
my position, either.

248
01:19:35,917 --> 01:19:37,667
We both want the same thing.

249
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,375
You remember the oath we took.

250
01:19:39,417 --> 01:19:41,583
It is our duty to fight all forms of crime

251
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:44,500
and to prevent anything unlawful.

252
01:19:44,792 --> 01:19:47,125
We have to ensure there is
peace and order in society,

253
01:19:47,167 --> 01:19:48,417
and we're duly expected...

254
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:40,083
Who are you waiting for?

255
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:50,375
Tell me...

256
01:22:58,792 --> 01:23:00,458
Who are you waiting for?

257
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:13,583
Why won't you tell me..?

258
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:23,958
Someone gave you chocolate.

259
01:23:27,625 --> 01:23:29,208
Show them to me.

260
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:32,917
They look like little hedgehogs, right?

261
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:44,542
A man in black gave you
the chocolate, didn't he?

262
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:55,125
Look, you have to tell me
who gave them to you.

263
01:23:56,542 --> 01:23:59,458
You have to tell me exactly
what he looked like.

264
01:24:03,792 --> 01:24:06,292
You have to tell me!
Who gave them to you?

265
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:13,333
Do you hear me?

266
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,083
I just don't want anything
to happen to you!

267
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:19,833
You stupid creature!

268
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:21,958
Will you tell me at once?

269
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,250
Who gave them to you!

270
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:27,250
You hear me?
Who gave them to you?!

271
01:33:48,667 --> 01:33:50,375
When did it happen?

272
01:33:53,042 --> 01:33:54,208
Just recently.

273
01:33:57,167 --> 01:33:58,333
Is he dead?

274
01:34:02,292 --> 01:34:03,375
He vanished.

275
01:34:04,042 --> 01:34:06,708
Was it a large man in a black coat?

276
01:34:10,083 --> 01:34:11,917
He was speeding...

277
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,833
as if he were being hunted.
