00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:58,994
Good morning.

2
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,583
This is your wake—up call.

3
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,979
Thank you for staying
at the new dannin inn.

4
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:05,709
The time is 10:30 am.

5
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:12,766
You have no new messages.

6
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:19,352
- Johnny?

7
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:23,205
Yeah?

8
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:33,059
Where are you going this time?

9
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:34,234
I travel...

10
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:36,444
How i make my living.

11
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,101
Data storage, remember?

12
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:45,478
You have no new messages.

13
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,878
Nas: Nerve
attenuation syndrome...

14
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:54,845
Cause unknown. Cure unknown.

15
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,040
Where is home, Johnny?

16
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:00,518
Home?

17
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:02,706
Home?

18
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,859
Would you believe I don't even know?

19
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,391
- Yes, I would.

20
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,581
- Going out?
- Just getting some ice.

21
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:28,463
We've got... ice.

22
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:50,027
Pick it up, Ralfi.

23
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:54,273
How about it, Ralfi?

24
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:56,716
You said you'd lock down
a date for the procedure.

25
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:58,408
And hello to you too.

26
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:01,936
Ralfi, the date, when?

27
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:03,336
I'm sorry, Johnny.

28
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:05,429
The Shiba neurosurgeons
have changed their quote.

29
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:08,716
- You told me 800k would cover it.

30
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:12,042
The fee for removing the
implant is now 1 million—5.

31
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:14,616
That is complete memory recovery.

32
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:18,019
If you don't want it all back,
I think they will come down.

33
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:24,750
If I just wanted the silicon
dug out of my back brain,

34
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:26,919
I could go to Mexico City.

35
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,171
I want a full restoration!

36
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:31,465
I want it all back!

37
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:34,593
Johnny, the shiba
boys, they set the price.

38
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:36,888
- I've done what I can.
- Come on, ralfi!

39
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:41,642
- One more run, Johnny, and
then you could cover it,

40
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:43,227
provided it's a rich one.

41
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:45,622
Yeah...

42
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:53,006
- So, what have you got?
- — It depends.

43
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,426
Did you get that upgrade
we were discussing?

44
00:04:56,794 --> 00:04:58,317
- — Yeah.
- Very good.

45
00:04:58,747 --> 00:05:03,125
Pickup is in central Beijing
tomorrow night, 10:00.

46
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:04,169
This is a big one, Johnny.

47
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,306
Don't be late.

48
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,370
Please disperse immediately!

49
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:24,184

50
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:25,864
Live from Central Beijing.

51
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:28,703
Where police tactial squad are
clashing with demonstrators...

52
00:06:28,794 --> 00:06:32,596
Protesting the Chinese government stance
on Nerve Attenuation Syndrome.

53
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,575
Paging Mr. Smith.

54
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,346
Paging Mr. Smith.

Paging Mr. Smith. (Mandarin-Chinese)

56
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:07,828
Paging Mr. Smith. (Mandarin-Chinese)

57
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:46,490
Nas, the so-called black shakes,

58
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,759
first identified in 2010...

59
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:51,568
in a small population of
nonnegian information—...

60
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:54,070
- Snatch back your brain, zombie!

61
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:56,359
Snatch it back and hold it.

62
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:58,039
Sorry, technical difficulty.

63
00:07:58,064 --> 00:08:00,817
Please come in.

64
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,541
Activating pemex memory doubler.

65
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,585
Your present capacity: 80 gigabytes.

66
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:25,754
Doubler loading.

67
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,638
Your storage capacity
is now 160 gigabytes.

68
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,474
Warning: Do not exceed capacity.

69
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,698
The courier is late! — be calm.

70
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:54,711
Relax... watch TV.

71
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:07,952
- Double cheese, anchovies?

72
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:11,372
- You are mister... — Smith.

73
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:13,796
- You are late.
- Right.

74
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:26,295
Question. — yes?

75
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:30,174
You don't look like the kind
of people I usually work for.

76
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,010
- We are new at this.

77
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:36,263
No shit.

78
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:39,099
- We approached you through
the correct channels.

79
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,934
We paid half in advance
to the Swiss account,

80
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:43,436
exactly as your agent instructed.

81
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:45,606
Here's your ticket, first class.

82
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,694
- Let's see what you wanna upload.

83
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:56,825
Motion detector.

84
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:00,144
In case the natives get restless.

85
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:03,111
How much am I carrying?

86
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:04,906
- 320 gigabytes.

87
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:07,825
Your storage capacity?

88
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:10,828
Where am I taking it? — Newark.

89
00:10:12,497 --> 00:10:14,665
- Your storage capacity?

90
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:19,504
- More than adequate.

91
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:23,630
MAN: So you'll take him to Las Vegas?

92
00:10:23,865 --> 00:10:24,942
WOMAN: I just started...

93
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:27,636
It is extremely dangerous

94
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:30,847
If the upload volume exceeds
your storage capacity.

95
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:33,809
Synaptic seepage can kill
you in two or three days.

96
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,686
Plus, the data may be corrupted,

97
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:39,941
and coherent download will be impossible.

98
00:10:41,818 --> 00:10:43,498
We don't have a problem with that, okay?

99
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:49,659
We loading or not?

100
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:52,619
Your ticket.

101
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:54,955
Ralfi, your agent in Newark,

102
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:56,999
will arrange the meet for the download.

103
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:47,830
When
the counter approaches zero,

104
00:11:47,986 --> 00:11:52,573
click on three frames
off the TV, any three.

105
00:11:52,574 --> 00:11:55,201
They'll meld with the data and
I won't know what they are.

106
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:56,578
That's the download code.

107
00:11:57,986 --> 00:12:00,240
You get a hard copy.

108
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:03,327
You fax one copy to your
connection on the other side.

109
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:06,038
When I get there, we feed
in the code and download.

110
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,039
Understand?

111
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:19,290
Upload begins when you press here.

112
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:26,600
- — Who's the target?
- Scientists.

113
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:30,188
Pharmakom r & d people, defectors.

114
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,483
Hit me!

115
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,881
- The access code.

116
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,833
Mr. ... Smith?

117
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,751
Where's the bathroom?

118
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:07,587
What? — the toilet.

119
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:17,346
Destroy the original!

120
00:14:17,347 --> 00:14:18,932
Fax the images to Newark.

121
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:33,302
Aah! Oh, Jesus!

122
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:36,896
Jesus! Shit! Ah— aah!

123
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:09,401
Water temperature is 17 degrees.

124
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,724
Next time, knock, baldy.

125
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,140
Transmission commencing.

126
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,079
Transmission interrupted.

127
00:16:55,165 --> 00:16:56,165
Get him!

128
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:14,167
You, where is he going?

129
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:20,924
- Where is he taking the data?
- Newark!

130
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:20,875
Immigration

131
00:18:23,845 --> 00:18:25,430

Neural failure within 24 hours.

137
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:47,200
Seek medical attention immediately.

138
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:49,203
- — Thank you.
- Welcome to Newark.

139
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:57,283
Final boarding call for Western Pacific Air
Flight 86, Gate 1 1 3.

140
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,479
(Little girl giggling)

141
00:19:07,882 --> 00:19:09,562
(Little girl giggling)

142
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:12,375
(Little girl giggling)

143
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:18,872
 Papa it's new.

144
00:19:24,144 --> 00:19:26,294
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Takahashi

145
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:27,856
Shinji's here.

146
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:05,534
Tokyo wants me to
recover the stolen data

147
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:08,245
for pharmakominat industries of Zurich.

148
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:13,083
Our operation in Beijing
met with limited success.

149
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:15,211
The pharmakom traitors are dead.

150
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:17,713
The courier, however,
escaped with the data.

151
00:20:17,714 --> 00:20:19,715
He's on his way here to Newark.

152
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:25,054
I didn't want to disturb
you in your time of grief.

153
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:27,932
It must be very difficult
to lose an only child.

154
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:31,014
I assumed you would be unavailable.

155
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,709
I'm not at Liberty to say.

156
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,784
I've been charged with recovering

157
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,995
the head of the mnemonic
courier, cryogenically preserved.

158
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,080
Preserved?

159
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,666
The traitors wiped
the pharmakom mainframe.

160
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,044
If we lose the courier,
they've lost the data forever.

161
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:59,966
If the courier is in Newark,
it's my responsibility.

162
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,678
You have part of the
courier's download code.

163
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:27,176
Get me Pharmakom.

164
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:33,107
Make you own images, get your life back!

165
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:36,037
The human race is waiting for you zombies!

166
00:21:42,307 --> 00:21:44,684
- Just what's the deal here?
- Johnny boy...

167
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:47,770
- Johnny boy, my ass. What's
the fucking score here?

168
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:49,440
I'm way overloaded, man.

169
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:52,567
You would not believe how much.

170
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:55,194
- You told me you got... upgraded.

171
00:21:55,195 --> 00:21:57,196
- Yeah, yeah, I did.

172
00:21:57,197 --> 00:21:58,448
I got the goods, Ralfi.

173
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:00,158
 Now I just wanna get them out of my head.

174
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,202
Did they get the code out?
— don't worry.

175
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:05,831
They said they can extract.
— extract?

176
00:22:06,373 --> 00:22:07,373
Ex—

177
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:11,127
What's going on, Ralfi?

178
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:13,212
This feels like a blown deal, man.

179
00:22:13,213 --> 00:22:15,840
- You say you have to get the data out.

180
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:18,509
They are the only ones who can do it.

181
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,220
There's no other choice. Trust me.

182
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:23,139
I will tell the driver where to take you.

183
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,140
- Yeah, sure.

184
00:22:47,122 --> 00:22:49,308
- I need to get some work.

185
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,364
- About these episodes you've been having,

186
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:53,825
I wanna get you back to
the shop for some tests.

187
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,952
Hey, are you listening?

188
00:22:58,005 --> 00:22:59,756
No more playing doctor, remember?

189
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:01,300
Oh, that's not what I meant.

190
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,769
Look at them. They must be
the oldest bodyguards in town.

191
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,855
I'm twice as fast as they are.

192
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:10,189
Not worried about your speed.

193
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,774
I'm worried about your nervous system,

194
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:14,445
especially if you wanna
continue being a bodyguard.

195
00:23:20,784 --> 00:23:22,910
Get out of here, bitch.

196
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:23,911
Take it easy!

197
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:29,709
Your hired muscle is
aging on you, Ralfi.

198
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:32,211
I could've done ya.

199
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:34,922
Time you hired yourself
some young and fast, hmm?

200
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:36,507
- You mean, like you?

201
00:23:36,508 --> 00:23:38,969
- You're the best agent
for bodyguards in town.

202
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:43,556
I'm the fastest thing going,
now spider's jacked my system.

203
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:44,641
- Hold out your hand.

204
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:46,726
Okay.

205
00:23:49,646 --> 00:23:51,982
Fine. Just hold it there.

206
00:23:55,778 --> 00:23:58,446
- So?
- Just hold it there.

207
00:23:58,447 --> 00:24:00,782
You can hold it there, baby, can't you?

208
00:24:00,783 --> 00:24:01,783
- Yeah, sure.

209
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:06,245
See?

210
00:24:07,372 --> 00:24:09,208
- Cheap street implants hahaha.

211
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:12,585
- You're damaged goods, bitch.

212
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,879
Spiderman jacked you up, all right.

213
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,257
- Jacked her up so tight, she shakes.

214
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:21,135
- I cannot use you, not for muscle.

215
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:24,931
Ever considered something a
little less actively physical?

216
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:26,641
Like on your back, babe?

217
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:29,478
Ah, ooh! Or on your knees.

218
00:24:32,564 --> 00:24:34,148
I'll get a gig, Ralfi.

219
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:36,568
- Then I'm coming back for you.
- Sure.

220
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:03,929
Yo, J-Bone.

221
00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:18,986
What you clocking, man?

222
00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:21,613
- Some suit out from the city.

223
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:24,825
What for? — I don't know.

224
00:25:26,118 --> 00:25:27,494
Suits don't come out here.

225
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:55,480
You're Johnny?

226
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:59,193
- Am I?
- I sure hope so.

227
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,404
Come on in. We're here to help you.

228
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,291
We've gotta
stop meeting like this.

229
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:18,045
- Baldy!
- — doctor will see you now.

230
00:26:21,757 --> 00:26:23,883
You lied.

231
00:26:23,884 --> 00:26:25,426
Yeah.

232
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,602
Time to die. — time?

233
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:52,078
We've got all night, asshole!

234
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:52,955
Let me see that...

235
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:54,623
- Yo, toad, I said shut up, man.

236
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:20,481
Yo, J-man.

237
00:27:54,796 --> 00:27:56,713
You weren't on the menu.

238
00:27:56,714 --> 00:27:58,715
I want you to do something for me.

239
00:27:58,716 --> 00:28:01,344
- — Do?
- Yes. Say bye.

240
00:28:11,187 --> 00:28:12,998
Hold it right there.

241
00:28:15,147 --> 00:28:18,037
(Laughing)

242
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:39,631
You tooling up for an
evening of this stuff, huh?

243
00:28:39,632 --> 00:28:43,802
As long as you understand
one thing, we're even.

244
00:28:43,803 --> 00:28:45,054
I don't owe you shit.

245
00:28:47,223 --> 00:28:48,223
Who are you?

246
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:50,309
I'm J-Bone.

247
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:52,546
I run "Heaven".

248
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:00,524
The Lotek Headquarters.

249
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:19,075
Papa...

250
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:22,083
It's new.

251
00:29:22,474 --> 00:29:23,529
(Little girl giggling)

252
00:29:24,154 --> 00:29:25,208
(Little girl giggling)

253
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,044
How sad...

254
00:29:27,904 --> 00:29:30,950
So very sad Mr. Takahashi.

255
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:32,826
The lost of a child...

256
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,301
For I am, Mr. Takahashi...

257
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:38,450
There is only... memory.

258
00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:41,888
memory on the play of conscience.

259
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:46,263
An endless reckoning of the score.

260
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,872
When i see you there, i know you...
your purpose is lost.

261
00:29:51,771 --> 00:29:54,036
At the very core of all your power...

262
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:56,856
There's only an emptiness...

263
00:29:56,982 --> 00:29:58,349
Hollowness...

264
00:29:59,013 --> 00:30:01,122
Carved in the shape of the absent child.

265
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:03,138
Papa...

266
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,371
j' easy as apple pie j'

267
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,353
j' easy as j'

268
00:30:08,378 --> 00:30:09,459
Johnny!

269
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,792
They were waiting for me, Ralfi,

270
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:13,086
two big nasty men!

271
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:15,338
- Johnny, please, let me explain.

272
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:18,718
- Johnny!
- You set me up, my friend.

273
00:30:19,802 --> 00:30:21,470
Johnny, it's not my fault.

274
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:22,958
There's been a screw up!

275
00:30:23,973 --> 00:30:25,974
You're dead if you don't
get this batch of product

276
00:30:25,975 --> 00:30:27,372
out of my head.

277
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:30,654
- Shit!

278
00:30:32,106 --> 00:30:34,357
Not on the head!

279
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:36,630
Don't tell me you hit him on the head.

280
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,974
You know i haven't been in
one of this in years?

281
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:54,567
This way.

282
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,213
Hooky, give me my shit.

283
00:31:04,131 --> 00:31:05,131
Come on.

284
00:31:43,086 --> 00:31:44,505
How are you feeling, Johnny?

285
00:31:45,923 --> 00:31:48,132
What'd they upload, Ralfi,

286
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:51,010
the goddamn library of congress?

287
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:54,013
Feels like my brain's gonna explode.

288
00:31:54,014 --> 00:31:56,767
I think yourfriend here,
he can take care of that.

289
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:06,359
Ralfi,

290
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,778
you lying sack of shit.

291
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:10,988
- Please let's work
this out like gentlemen.

292
00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:12,240
Johnny, in this business,

293
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:14,951
you only fuck up once with Yakuza.

294
00:32:14,952 --> 00:32:16,411
- We'll need a bucket.

295
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:21,508
Pheww.. it's not sterile.

296
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:24,126
Put it here beside the table.

297
00:32:24,127 --> 00:32:26,547
- Can we talk about this?
- Talk?

298
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:28,965
I have one image of the access code.

299
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:30,550
You have the other two.

300
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:32,760
I'll give you the data. Everybody happy.

301
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:35,532
You don't understand.

302
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,832
They don't just want the data,

303
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:41,210
they want everything
it's ever been stored in.

304
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,670
There's less danger of information decay.

305
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,215
And we don't have to worry
about anyone going in

306
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:47,675
with mnemonic sensors.

307
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,388
These days, you see,

308
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,142
Dead men can tell tales.

309
00:32:57,143 --> 00:33:00,219
- There's gotta be a way to work this out!

310
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,470
There is.

311
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,313
- Would you hurry it up, please?

312
00:33:11,564 --> 00:33:12,618
It's getting disgusting.

313
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,788
What the fuck is going on?

314
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:30,540
I'll slit his fucking throat, bitch.

315
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:34,169
- So? Other guy gonna
cut his whole head off.

316
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:37,422
- Jane, Jane, what say we
pay you for a night's work

317
00:33:37,423 --> 00:33:40,467
and you just walk away?
— I'll pay you 20 grand.

318
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:43,136
You wouldn't
believe the shit you're in.

319
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:44,137
- 50.

320
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:47,557
Deal!

321
00:33:47,582 --> 00:33:48,697
Ah, you bitch!

322
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,049
We'll be okay, I got the gun. Let's go.

323
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:25,763
Time to go!

324
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,474
Bitch!

325
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:37,023
- You could have fucking killed me!

326
00:34:37,024 --> 00:34:39,151
Get out of the way!

327
00:34:57,211 --> 00:34:59,213
What are you doing? — my gear.

328
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,124
In here.

329
00:36:32,514 --> 00:36:34,683
- Back door. — thanks, J-Bone.

330
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,021
We'll find you again! Count on it!

331
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,067
Down!

332
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,194
You loteks will regret this.

333
00:36:56,288 --> 00:36:57,914
I have to get online.

334
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,999
Must be somebody I can
talk to to square this.

335
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,210
- 50 thou, you said.

336
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:06,966
Time I see the color, right?
— right.

337
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:08,996
You were terrific.

338
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:10,760
So if you'll just point the way out

339
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,428
and give me an account number
for the cash transfer—

340
00:37:12,429 --> 00:37:13,806
Account number?

341
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:17,351
I'm on you till you pay, mister.

342
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:26,448
How come they wanna cut
off your head anyway?

343
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:29,117
I mean, usually they just
off people around here.

344
00:37:29,118 --> 00:37:30,202
Long story.

345
00:37:30,203 --> 00:37:33,747
Well, I'm gonna be around
until I get paid, so...

346
00:37:33,748 --> 00:37:36,375
I can carry nearly 80
gigs of data in my head,

347
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:37,959
160 if I use a doubler.

348
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,045
Trouble is, somebody stuck
in a lot more than that

349
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:41,463
and I don't know how to get it back out.

350
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:43,048
Okay, so wait a minute. Wait a minute.

351
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:45,425
You're a smuggler? In your head?

352
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:49,700
Hey!... What's wrong?

353
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:54,894
Come here. Sit down, sit down!

354
00:38:00,092 --> 00:38:01,885
Oh, man, you are fucked up severe.

355
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,341
Stay quiet,

356
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:08,684
Shh, okay? Okay?

357
00:38:14,506 --> 00:38:15,917
(Little girl giggling)

358
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:17,734
Papa.

359
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,810
It's new.

360
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:23,919
(Little girl giggling)

361
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:25,036
Papa.

362
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:26,458
(Little girl giggling)

363
00:38:29,623 --> 00:38:33,335
- Takahashi, how sad, the loss of a child.

364
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:36,797
They know that your purpose
in life has been lost.

365
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,175
It died with your daughter.

366
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:42,594
You have become a risk to them.

367
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:44,971
Take a good look at their errand boy,

368
00:38:44,972 --> 00:38:47,766
the one who wants the courier's head.

369
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:49,893
He's plotting to destroy you.

370
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,854
You must neutralize him, Takahashi.

371
00:38:52,115 --> 00:38:54,107
Now!... Then we can talk.

372
00:38:54,654 --> 00:38:55,738
I promise you,

373
00:38:56,865 --> 00:39:00,450
the courier, what he carries

374
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:02,911
can give you new a purpose in life.

375
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,331
I was Pharmakom. And I...

376
00:39:07,876 --> 00:39:09,419
They're listening.

377
00:39:10,753 --> 00:39:12,422
They're everywhere.

378
00:39:15,631 --> 00:39:18,482
Excuse me Sir but Shinji's here
with two of his men.

379
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:27,857
You can't just walk in here!

380
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:30,972
I told them to wait, Takahashi-san.

381
00:39:31,615 --> 00:39:32,655
Who are they?

382
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:34,852
They are my Kobuns. (protégés)

383
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:27,597
Don't let that happen again.

384
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,510
Locate him... inform me!

385
00:40:34,037 --> 00:40:36,849
I will supervise his capture.

386
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,303
Understood?

387
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:58,286
(Kids laughing)

388
00:41:09,365 --> 00:41:10,365
Uh.

389
00:41:16,787 --> 00:41:19,789
It's just my stuff.

390
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:22,501
Mace, throwing spikes, grenade,

391
00:41:23,544 --> 00:41:25,879
everything a girl needs.

392
00:41:28,048 --> 00:41:29,174
- You let me sleep?

393
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:32,344
- You needed it.

394
00:41:36,056 --> 00:41:37,974
I told you I was in a hurry.

395
00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:40,561
I'm a dead man if! Don't
get this out of my head.

396
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:48,624
- Hey, do you ever sneak
a look at what you carry?

397
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:52,419
- Usually, there's a code, like a lock.

398
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,881
Well, when there isn't? — no.

399
00:41:55,882 --> 00:41:57,132
It goes with the territory.

400
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:59,594
Safer for me, safer for the client.

401
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,970
How come you knew those...
— oh, call them "Loteks".

402
00:42:04,891 --> 00:42:06,893
I sort of hung with them when I was a kid.

403
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,898
Say, how do you fit all that
shit in your head, anyway?

404
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:15,485
Must've been pretty
good at memorizing, huh?

405
00:42:16,361 --> 00:42:18,862
Implant, wet-wired.

406
00:42:18,863 --> 00:42:20,864
I had to dump a chunk of long—term memory.

407
00:42:20,865 --> 00:42:22,659
- You had to dump a chunk of what?

408
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:25,745
- My childhood.
- — your childhood?

409
00:42:28,873 --> 00:42:30,458
Really?

410
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:33,877
All of it?

411
00:42:34,796 --> 00:42:36,214
You can't remember a thing?

412
00:42:37,298 --> 00:42:39,675
- Maybe there's some residual traces.

413
00:42:39,676 --> 00:42:41,260
Every now and then, there's something,

414
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:43,179
but I.. I can never hold onto it.

415
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,306
That's a seriously
weird—ass thing to do.

416
00:42:46,307 --> 00:42:49,142
Yeah, well, maybe I didn't
lose anything I wanted to keep.

417
00:42:49,143 --> 00:42:51,436
I needed the space for the job.

418
00:42:51,437 --> 00:42:53,814
Well, you got parents and stuff?

419
00:42:53,815 --> 00:42:57,402
- You got parents and stuff?
- — yeah.

420
00:42:58,403 --> 00:43:01,863
Once, but I haven't seen them in years.

421
00:43:01,864 --> 00:43:05,493
Yeah. Anyways, I don't
think about it much, okay?

422
00:43:06,703 --> 00:43:08,288
- So, what do you think about?

423
00:43:10,164 --> 00:43:12,457
When you're alone?

424
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:16,128
I think I want to get
out of this rat hole.

425
00:43:16,129 --> 00:43:20,435
I want to get online. I need a computer.

426
00:43:22,385 --> 00:43:23,552
Where'd you learn to do that?

427
00:43:23,553 --> 00:43:26,973
- I used to have a summer
job breaking and entering.

428
00:43:47,827 --> 00:43:50,412
I need a Sino-logic 16,

429
00:43:50,413 --> 00:43:54,374
Sogo 7 data gloves, a GPL stealth module,

430
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:58,504
one Burdine intelligent
translator, a Thomson iPhone.

431
00:44:28,451 --> 00:44:29,994

Making a long—distance phone call.

He'll use his connections on the net.

445
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:33,435
Narrow the bandwidth. Go low rent.

Shit. It's just an all—night copy shop.

448
00:45:42,623 --> 00:45:45,543
They were sending the fax to
a copy shop here in Newark.

00:46:19,767 --> 00:46:21,936
Nothing but a name, Dr. Allcome.

455
00:46:22,895 --> 00:46:25,894
Nothing came through. Shit!

456
00:46:31,988 --> 00:46:33,321
- Let's go, okay?

457
00:46:33,322 --> 00:46:36,284
No, I'm gonna try something
else, a guy called Strike.

458
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,035
He runs a board in this
sector, owes me a favor.

459
00:46:39,036 --> 00:46:40,955
Maybe he can find this doctor for me.

460
00:46:45,668 --> 00:46:46,876
We locked on him.

461
00:46:46,877 --> 00:46:50,714
He's using a sino-logic
16 gpl stealth module.

462
00:46:50,715 --> 00:46:55,928
Crazy Bob's computer shop,
5326 Sutton Plaza, backroom.

00:46:56,554 --> 00:46:58,014

466

- Get off my board, man.

467
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:13,903
You are too hot.

468
00:47:13,904 --> 00:47:17,157
You're a hit waiting to happen.

469
00:47:17,158 --> 00:47:19,784
- Off!
- You owe me, strike.

470
00:47:19,785 --> 00:47:21,703
I don't owe you that much.

471
00:47:21,704 --> 00:47:23,413
- I could crash you from here, man,

472
00:47:23,414 --> 00:47:24,998
wipe out your entire fucking board!

473
00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:29,169
Johnny, don't, man.
That's my livelihood.

474
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:31,296
Then stop bullshitting me!

475
00:47:31,297 --> 00:47:32,714
I need to know what I'm holding, Strike.

476
00:47:32,715 --> 00:47:33,882
Why is the Yakuza after it?

477
00:47:33,883 --> 00:47:34,883
Who's Dr. Allcome?

478
00:47:35,676 --> 00:47:40,890
All I know is, you've got
a head full of Pharmakom data

479
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:44,462
and they've hired the
Yakuza to get it out.

480
00:47:44,935 --> 00:47:45,978
Pharmakom?

481
00:47:47,271 --> 00:47:52,485
Shit! They put a virus on us.

482
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:58,365
- — Shit!
- Get out of here, man.

483
00:47:58,366 --> 00:48:01,202
I never heard of any Dr. Allcome.

484
00:48:03,204 --> 00:48:06,998
Johnny. Hurry, Johnny, they're coming!

485
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:10,210
- — Who the hell are you?
- Gotta go now.

486
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:11,211
Come on.

487
00:48:19,736 --> 00:48:20,736
Just my beer opener.

488
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:36,069
Inform Takahashi his tracker was late

489
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:37,363
in locating the courier.

490
00:48:38,614 --> 00:48:40,491
It seems he's already departed.

491
00:48:44,703 --> 00:48:47,122
Mr. Takahashi,
Shinji has failed again...

492
00:48:47,123 --> 00:48:48,540
to locate the courier.

493
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:49,708
Get me Karl.

494
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,963
Church of the Retransfiguration.

495
00:48:54,964 --> 00:48:56,132
Thank you for calling.

496
00:49:05,224 --> 00:49:07,308
- I need your services.

497
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:10,614
- We hold services nightly.
- You should join us.

498
00:49:11,439 --> 00:49:13,231
- A special one.

499
00:49:13,232 --> 00:49:17,528
- Do you need someone brought to Jesus?

500
00:49:20,224 --> 00:49:24,130
- Or to you?
- Only one part, his head.

501
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,996
And who is this lost soul,

502
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:31,541
this sinner unrepentant?

503
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:35,044
- A courier, last seen at the drome.

504
00:49:36,748 --> 00:49:38,583
Name is Johnny.

505
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:44,403
If you get me the head in
24 hours, triple the fee.

506
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:53,963
Karl, do not fail me.

507
00:50:00,383 --> 00:50:01,552
Can't use any of this.

508
00:50:02,842 --> 00:50:04,575
Yakuza's watching the net,

509
00:50:05,107 --> 00:50:07,307
Waiting for my first transaction.

510
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:16,713
Hey! What are you... what are you doing?

511
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:22,507
Mind if! Use this?
— man owes me 50 thou

512
00:50:22,508 --> 00:50:24,676
and he's scamming my phone card.

513
00:50:24,677 --> 00:50:26,262
And it's still our first date.

514
00:50:32,068 --> 00:50:34,880
Welcome to AT&T.

515
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:38,786
Enter password, please.

516
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:54,372
This is an unlisted
number. How did you get it?

517
00:50:54,373 --> 00:50:56,082
Don't like surprises? — no.

518
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:59,377
And it's a federal offense
to hack shielded lines.

519
00:50:59,378 --> 00:51:03,506
I have 320 gigabytes of pharmakom data.

520
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:07,011
Don't bother. I'll be out
of here in 20 seconds.

521
00:51:08,012 --> 00:51:11,347
So, what exactly is it that you want?

522
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:14,101
- Your data out of my head.
- — that can be arranged.

523
00:51:15,102 --> 00:51:16,811
Let's meet. — where?

524
00:51:16,812 --> 00:51:17,812
You're crazy, man!

525
00:51:17,813 --> 00:51:18,980
They're gonna chop your fucking head off!

526
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:21,316
No. They'll negotiate,
they're corporate.

527
00:51:21,317 --> 00:51:22,484
- So is the yakuza.

528
00:51:23,652 --> 00:51:25,361
Listen, if you don't come, fine.

529
00:51:25,362 --> 00:51:27,780
It's a business meeting,
it's not your kinda scene.

530
00:51:27,781 --> 00:51:30,033
If it works out, I'll pay
you the money I owe you.

531
00:51:30,034 --> 00:51:31,117
If it doesn't... — if it doesn't,

532
00:51:31,118 --> 00:51:33,228
you're one dead Johnny is what!

533
00:51:33,253 --> 00:51:34,531
I'm gonna be dead anyway

534
00:51:34,556 --> 00:51:36,122
if I don't get this shit outta my head!

535
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:41,396
Listen.

536
00:51:43,566 --> 00:51:46,068
I know this guy Spider,
used to be a doctor.

537
00:51:47,653 --> 00:51:51,114
He could help you. He could fix your...

538
00:51:51,115 --> 00:51:52,974
Hey, what's with you?

539
00:51:56,412 --> 00:51:58,205
I'll be all right.

540
00:51:58,206 --> 00:51:59,373
- Jesus, you're sick.

541
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:02,834
You strung out or what?

542
00:52:02,835 --> 00:52:05,045
You got nas! — no!

543
00:52:05,046 --> 00:52:06,588
You have the black shakes.

544
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:09,592
Whatever it is you have,
you're sidelined, right?

545
00:52:11,344 --> 00:52:12,303
I've gotta make this meeting.

546
00:52:12,304 --> 00:52:14,305
Hey! Hey, can you hear me?

547
00:52:17,016 --> 00:52:21,603
Spider! He could help you.

548
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:23,647
He could help me.

549
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:30,365
I—  too was stricken by the sickness that

550
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:34,661
devours the silver pathways of the soul,

551
00:52:34,838 --> 00:52:38,861
but the lord came to me and i was healed

552
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:42,767
and made post-human!

553
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,493
The darkness lays upon you now,

554
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:52,454
but I've come... to lead you

555
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,138
My children, I sense the need
for meditation,

556
00:53:01,197 --> 00:53:05,195
I must leave you now, the sermon is over.

557
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,972
If you're not expected,
then you're not invited!

558
00:53:45,997 --> 00:53:47,569
So fuck off, okay?

559
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:50,156
- It's Jane! She says you know her.

560
00:53:52,074 --> 00:53:54,607
Get down here, man. She's sick.

561
00:54:17,605 --> 00:54:19,439
Look, I gotta run. — shut up.

562
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,907
Give me that muscle relaxant
over there, the red one.

563
00:54:27,823 --> 00:54:30,533
- It's NAS, right?
- — yeah, the black shakes,

564
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:32,994
like half the people on the planet.

565
00:54:32,995 --> 00:54:35,538
Let me tell you something
so you get this straight.

566
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:38,875
It's not my work that got her
this way. My work is clean.

567
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:40,877
Besides, you don't get
this shit from amp jobs.

568
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:41,961
That's just a myth.

569
00:54:41,962 --> 00:54:44,422
- So, what does cause it?
- What causes it?

570
00:54:44,423 --> 00:54:46,966
The world causes it. This causes it!

571
00:54:46,967 --> 00:54:49,260
This causes it! This causes it!

572
00:54:49,261 --> 00:54:51,179
Information overload!

573
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:54,223
All the electronics around
you poisoning the airwaves!

574
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,851
Technological fucking civilization!

575
00:54:56,852 --> 00:54:58,728
But we still have all this shit

576
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:00,980
'cause we can't live without it.

577
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:02,149
Let me do my work.

578
00:55:14,787 --> 00:55:16,497
Whoa, street preacher's out.

579
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:20,501
J-Bone, you copying?

580
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:23,085
That son of a bitch doesn't have

581
00:55:23,124 --> 00:55:25,463
one natural bone left in his body.

582
00:55:25,464 --> 00:55:27,674
- He really a preacher, J-Bone?

583
00:55:27,675 --> 00:55:28,675
Preacher?

584
00:55:28,676 --> 00:55:31,844
That motherfucker's got god
and technology ass-backwards.

585
00:55:31,845 --> 00:55:32,970
He'll kill for anybody money

586
00:55:32,971 --> 00:55:35,348
just to keep his body full of implants.

587
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:37,850
- — Want me to follow him?
- No, stay away from him.

588
00:55:37,851 --> 00:55:38,852
He's too crazy.

589
00:55:41,689 --> 00:55:44,440
Anna Kalmann, founder, former CEO

590
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:47,735
of the multinational
Pharmakominat Industries, Zurich.

591
00:55:47,736 --> 00:55:50,405
Born the 1st of August, 1965.

592
00:55:50,406 --> 00:55:52,365
Died the 3rd of September, 2015.

593
00:55:52,366 --> 00:55:53,366
Died?

594
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:56,077
Six years ago?

595
00:55:56,078 --> 00:55:59,205
She was imprinted to Pharmakom's
neural-net installation

596
00:55:59,206 --> 00:56:01,916
in Zurich prior to onset of morbidity.

597
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:03,376
Imprinted?

598
00:56:03,377 --> 00:56:05,837
Her neural—net persona
has Swiss citizenship

599
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:09,258
under the Artificial
Intelligence Laws of 2006.

600
00:56:10,175 --> 00:56:13,971
She advises the current board
from this state of being.

601
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,856
Pharmakom, Newark.

602
00:56:28,736 --> 00:56:30,404
- Johnny. — what are you doing?

603
00:56:32,698 --> 00:56:35,783
Just looking.
— don't touch anything!

604
00:56:35,784 --> 00:56:38,119
Who the fuck are you anyway?

605
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,494
- Johnny. — Johnny who?

606
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:42,832
Just Johnny.

607
00:56:46,589 --> 00:56:47,589
Ugh!

608
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,676
It looks like a full—service shop here.

609
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:55,595
How are you on brain implants?

610
00:56:55,596 --> 00:56:58,723
Silicon implants, neural
overlays, memory augmentation?

611
00:56:58,724 --> 00:57:02,018
- We don't get much of that out
here in Newark, just Johnny.

612
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:04,313
Kind of upscale for us, you know?

613
00:57:05,564 --> 00:57:07,231
Got mine in Singapore.

614
00:57:07,232 --> 00:57:10,194
- Oh, yeah? What's your deal, just Johnny?

615
00:57:12,154 --> 00:57:15,240
I got this problem, up here.

616
00:57:16,617 --> 00:57:20,870
"They err in vision.
They stumble in judgment."

617
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:26,452
"For all the tables are full
of vomit and filthiness,"

618
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:30,338
"so that there is no place clean."

619
00:57:30,339 --> 00:57:32,507
- You should have seen it before.

620
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:36,707
- Isaiah.
- — Isaiah? Mine's Hooky.

621
00:57:46,888 --> 00:57:47,923
Hey! Hey!

622
00:57:49,037 --> 00:57:52,454
Aaargh!

623
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:02,606
The girl.

624
00:58:02,607 --> 00:58:05,139
The girl that took Ralfi's
boy out of the backroom,

625
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:10,156
who is she?

626
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:13,492
- Do you expect me to
remember half the shit—...

627
00:58:13,493 --> 00:58:14,493
Heal!

628
00:58:15,061 --> 00:58:16,243
Aaah!

629
00:58:21,116 --> 00:58:25,491
Oh, man, why'd you
have to do that?

630
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:33,721
Who's the girl? — a wannabe.

631
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:37,684
She's always hanging around
here looking for a job.

632
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:40,437
Name? — it's Jane.

633
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:46,233
More. — ooh.

634
00:58:46,234 --> 00:58:49,653
One of Spider's jobs. — Spider?

635
00:58:49,654 --> 00:58:53,450
- He's a flesh mechanic.
- Implants and shit, you know?

636
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:58,913
They said he used to be a
legit doctor once, but...

637
00:58:58,914 --> 00:59:02,334
Where?

638
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:28,234
They did some serious
shoehorning to get that in there.

639
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:30,736
Skip the technical critique,
okay, I need some help here.

640
00:59:30,737 --> 00:59:33,113
You don't know the half of it.

641
00:59:33,114 --> 00:59:34,448
You must be hurting like hell.

642
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:36,826
Think I need
you to tell me that?

643
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:39,746
I got 320 gigs in here.
— oh, yeah?

644
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:44,500
What is it exactly? What kind of stuff?

645
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:46,418
I haven't got a clue.

646
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:48,463
And I don't have a download code either.

647
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:06,409
Hey.

648
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:09,338
You doing okay?

649
01:00:11,049 --> 01:00:12,091
- Good girl, Janie.

650
01:00:13,092 --> 01:00:14,719
You brought him to the right place.

651
01:00:15,762 --> 01:00:17,597
- You can fix him?
- — I don't know.

652
01:00:18,723 --> 01:00:22,309
With his seepage, if I
could work a download,

653
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:24,269
I don't know if the
product would be coherent.

654
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:28,065
Fuck the product! I just want it out.

655
01:00:28,066 --> 01:00:29,567
I wish it was that simple.

656
01:00:31,444 --> 01:00:35,155
Allcome. Dr. Allcome,
ever hear that name?

657
01:00:35,156 --> 01:00:37,157
- Maybe. — where is he?

658
01:00:37,158 --> 01:00:38,284
- I said maybe!

659
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,912
- Why do you wanna see him?
- Oh, come on, Spider!

660
01:00:41,913 --> 01:00:43,997
I'll make sure just Johnny gets to see

661
01:00:43,998 --> 01:00:45,874
who he needs to see.

662
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:49,795
But you, you need bed rest, downtime.

663
01:00:49,796 --> 01:00:50,796
- He's my client.

664
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:54,842
I'm telling
you, you gotta sleep.

665
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:57,428
Just tell me where to go.

666
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:05,270
All right. I'll drive you.
— right.

667
01:01:16,155 --> 01:01:18,031
Halt, sinners! — fuck!

668
01:01:18,032 --> 01:01:19,040
Spider, look out!

669
01:01:24,622 --> 01:01:27,333
- — Who the fuck was that?
- You don't wanna know.

670
01:01:34,744 --> 01:01:35,759
Jesus.

671
01:01:55,843 --> 01:01:58,346
Where are we? — you'll see.

672
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:24,704
He's been
this way for an hour now.

673
01:02:24,705 --> 01:02:26,025
I don't know what to do with him.

674
01:02:27,573 --> 01:02:29,782
If we still got any
paralon b, give him 20 mgs.

675
01:02:30,426 --> 01:02:31,967
Fucking Pharmakom, man.

676
01:02:31,992 --> 01:02:34,428
That shit costs 2 grand per clinical unit.

677
01:02:38,862 --> 01:02:41,531
Keep him warm and bring me
his charts when you can.

678
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,100
- Here are the charts, doctor.

679
01:02:56,945 --> 01:02:58,112
Where's Dr. Allcome?

680
01:02:59,197 --> 01:03:01,990
Dr. Allcome is a name used in hospitals

681
01:03:01,991 --> 01:03:03,492
when we got a major problem

682
01:03:03,493 --> 01:03:05,452
and don't wanna spook the patients.

683
01:03:05,453 --> 01:03:10,040
- — What?
- "Doctor all come to Ward 7,"

684
01:03:10,041 --> 01:03:12,960
and we drop everything
and haul ass to wherever.

685
01:03:12,961 --> 01:03:16,004
Usually means we got a
crazy, somebody violent.

686
01:03:16,005 --> 01:03:18,173
But I saw it on the fax buffer.

687
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:19,884
That fax was meant for us.

688
01:03:20,885 --> 01:03:22,719
Who's us?

689
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,764
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

690
01:03:27,392 --> 01:03:29,935
Who's us? — the NAS underground,

691
01:03:29,936 --> 01:03:31,853
people who keep this place going,

692
01:03:31,854 --> 01:03:32,854
people like me.

693
01:03:33,606 --> 01:03:34,606
Get on the table.

694
01:03:35,858 --> 01:03:38,151
- Why?
- — don't be a bigger asshole

695
01:03:38,152 --> 01:03:39,028
than you have to.

696
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:40,028
Just get on the table.

697
01:03:49,747 --> 01:03:50,747
All right.

698
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:52,791
Jack in.

699
01:04:00,466 --> 01:04:01,466
Lie down.

700
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,307
Let's take a look at this shit.

701
01:04:10,143 --> 01:04:11,268
No access code?

702
01:04:11,269 --> 01:04:14,021
Except for one image, out of three.

703
01:04:14,022 --> 01:04:14,939
It won't help.

704
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,773
What did they use? Random images?

705
01:04:16,774 --> 01:04:17,984
Yeah, from the TV.

706
01:04:18,985 --> 01:04:20,402
- I've got some decryption codes here.

707
01:04:20,403 --> 01:04:22,946
I'll run them, see if we
come up with anything.

708
01:04:22,947 --> 01:04:25,157
Janie, you should really try and lie down.

709
01:04:25,158 --> 01:04:26,408
- Can you break the code, Spider?

710
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:28,982
If I get lucky, really lucky.

711
01:04:49,474 --> 01:04:50,599
Fuck!

712
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,809
- No dice?
- — no. But I can get it out.

713
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:54,811
How?
— with a general anesthetic,

714
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:56,855
a cranial drill, and pair of forceps.

715
01:04:56,856 --> 01:04:58,690
- And I could die too, right?

716
01:04:58,691 --> 01:05:01,318
It's gonna kill you
anyway when it ruptures.

717
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:03,612
I take it out, you'll probably survive.

718
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:05,572
You'll probably lose
some fine motor skills,

719
01:05:05,573 --> 01:05:06,948
you might not be able to remember anything

720
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:08,408
for more than three minutes at a time.

721
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:09,410
Fuck that!

722
01:05:11,496 --> 01:05:12,871
Let me tell you something!

723
01:05:12,872 --> 01:05:14,706
Let's just start with
what you got in there

724
01:05:14,707 --> 01:05:15,583
and what it's worth,

725
01:05:15,584 --> 01:05:18,043
what it's worth to the world.

726
01:05:18,044 --> 01:05:20,300
You're carrying the cure for NAS.

727
01:05:22,274 --> 01:05:25,109
You're telling me I got-—
— Pharmakom's complete R & D

728
01:05:25,134 --> 01:05:27,803
on their cure for nerve
attenuation syndrome.

729
01:05:27,804 --> 01:05:30,680
Plus the records of the field
trials to prove that it works.

730
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:32,141
And it really works.

731
01:05:33,726 --> 01:05:35,519
You mean, like, a real cure?

732
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,770
They could have you straightened out

733
01:05:36,771 --> 01:05:39,565
in three weeks, Janie,
you and everybody else.

734
01:05:41,401 --> 01:05:43,276
- Everybody's trying to cut off my head.

735
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:44,861
- So they can take it back to Saigon

736
01:05:44,862 --> 01:05:47,280
and run it through a quantum
interference detector.

737
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:49,449
But then, they would have
the cure and we wouldn't.

738
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:52,327
You keep that thing in your
head and nobody can save you.

739
01:05:52,328 --> 01:05:54,704
Plus, the cure is gone forever.

740
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:56,581
I can save the cure.

741
01:05:56,582 --> 01:05:58,834
Even if we had the code,
the seepage is so bad,

742
01:05:58,835 --> 01:06:00,502
it would probably come out as garbage.

743
01:06:00,503 --> 01:06:03,296
What's it supposed to
matter to me if I'm dead?

744
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:06,174
- Follow me?
- The cure can save millions.

745
01:06:06,175 --> 01:06:08,636
You're gonna die anyway
if we don't get it out.

746
01:06:11,931 --> 01:06:15,016
All I know is that
whatever's in my head is

747
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:16,810
worth a lot of money.

748
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:18,229
Why should I trust you?

749
01:06:19,188 --> 01:06:22,899
You're supposed to be my
bodyguard here. Bodyguard!

750
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,443
You're not walking outta here,

751
01:06:24,444 --> 01:06:26,153
not with that cure in your head!

752
01:06:27,924 --> 01:06:31,284
The sinner's sinner's head
hold the Lord's cure!

753
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,818
That cure is mine!

754
01:06:38,432 --> 01:06:39,892
Behold, your savior!

755
01:06:57,792 --> 01:06:59,530
- Jane, get him to Jones!

756
01:06:59,555 --> 01:07:03,182
Go! Get him to Jones!
- It's your only chance! Go!

757
01:07:06,721 --> 01:07:07,721
Go!

758
01:07:11,855 --> 01:07:14,232
Who's Jones?

759
01:07:14,257 --> 01:07:17,206
He's that guy who fucks
your mother.

760
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:32,748
Where are they?

761
01:07:36,356 --> 01:07:41,649
Aaah!

762
01:07:48,818 --> 01:07:51,486
I couldn't make the meeting,
but I'm still up for it.

763
01:07:51,487 --> 01:07:53,113
Are you?

764
01:07:53,114 --> 01:07:54,698
- Certainly.

765
01:07:54,699 --> 01:07:58,285
This time, on the bridge, landfill 5.

766
01:07:58,286 --> 01:08:00,922
Bring the rest of the code. I'll find you.

767
01:08:00,947 --> 01:08:02,490
I'll be there.

768
01:08:02,999 --> 01:08:04,292
I want to negotiate.

769
01:08:05,126 --> 01:08:06,126
- Yes, sir.

770
01:08:08,045 --> 01:08:11,340
Great! Now if they don't
kill you, J-Bone will.

771
01:08:19,223 --> 01:08:21,641
Listen to me, Takahashi,
before it's too late.

772
01:08:21,642 --> 01:08:24,269
We're running out of time.
He's carrying the cure for—...

773
01:08:55,428 --> 01:08:56,428
Hey!

774
01:08:57,347 --> 01:08:58,347
Hey!

775
01:09:01,142 --> 01:09:03,936
I told her if she wanna get with me,

776
01:09:03,937 --> 01:09:05,896
then I wanna get with her.

777
01:09:05,897 --> 01:09:07,147
And screw the physical disability.

778
01:09:07,148 --> 01:09:09,358
Hey! — you know what I'm saying?

779
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,569
Because it's about the feeling, right?

780
01:09:13,196 --> 01:09:14,196
What's up?

781
01:09:15,782 --> 01:09:16,908
Wind maybe.

782
01:09:19,732 --> 01:09:20,810
Listen up!

783
01:09:21,803 --> 01:09:22,803
Hey!

784
01:09:29,685 --> 01:09:31,228
What do you think?

785
01:09:31,229 --> 01:09:32,105
I mean, it's crazy,

786
01:09:32,106 --> 01:09:34,731
but if it's really the
cure to NAS in my head,

787
01:09:34,732 --> 01:09:35,732
it could save you.

788
01:09:37,318 --> 01:09:38,986
I mean, it could save everybody.

789
01:09:45,952 --> 01:09:50,748
Well, who is this Jones guy
spider said was our only chance?

790
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:53,333
He's...

791
01:09:54,127 --> 01:09:56,211
He's...

792
01:09:56,212 --> 01:09:58,004
He was in the Navy.

793
01:09:58,005 --> 01:09:59,131
Yeah, in the war.

794
01:09:59,132 --> 01:10:01,258
You know, they put a lot
of stuff in his head,

795
01:10:01,259 --> 01:10:02,218
kinda like you.

796
01:10:02,219 --> 01:10:04,386
Oh, yeah, like memory augments?

797
01:10:04,387 --> 01:10:05,596
I don't know.

798
01:10:07,682 --> 01:10:08,682
You'll see.

799
01:10:14,272 --> 01:10:15,605
Hey!

800
01:10:15,606 --> 01:10:19,401
- Man, somebody crazy down
there is getting on my nerves.

801
01:10:19,402 --> 01:10:22,112
Rat lands are full of crazies,
stick. Ignore it, man.

802
01:10:22,113 --> 01:10:24,197
Come on! Hey!

803
01:10:24,198 --> 01:10:25,198
No, man.

804
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:30,041
Right down there! It's spider's Van!

805
01:10:30,986 --> 01:10:34,739
Yep. Better tell J-Bone.
— I got an idea.

806
01:10:35,686 --> 01:10:36,858
Hehehehe!

807
01:10:37,225 --> 01:10:39,685
Let's drop a bug on Spider-man.

808
01:10:39,846 --> 01:10:42,515
- — Forget it, Stick.
- Hey, check it out,

809
01:10:42,516 --> 01:10:45,574
- I'm gonna do it.
- Hey, don't even say that.

810
01:10:45,599 --> 01:10:47,433
J-Bone will shit if he hears you.

811
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:49,563
You know how jumpy he is lately.

812
01:10:49,681 --> 01:10:52,726
No, I'm gonna do it.
— hey, wake up, damn it!

813
01:10:53,936 --> 01:10:55,686
Hey, shit, man!
— "hey, shit" nothing.

814
01:10:55,687 --> 01:10:57,355
That's what they're for.

815
01:10:57,356 --> 01:10:59,775
Whoa, whoa, whoa! — hey! Hey!

816
01:11:03,888 --> 01:11:04,888
Fuck! Shit!

817
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,561
Man, you are an idiot!

818
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:25,996
What the fuck is going on?

819
01:11:28,624 --> 01:11:31,085
What the fuck is going on?

820
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:34,420
You know,

821
01:11:36,048 --> 01:11:40,302
all my life, I've been careful
to stay in my own corner,

822
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:44,675
looking out for Number One
no complications.

823
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:52,152
Now, suddenly, I'm responsible
for the entire fucking world!

824
01:11:52,986 --> 01:11:55,780
And everybody and his mother
is trying to kill me, if,

825
01:11:55,781 --> 01:11:59,408
if, my head doesn't blow up first.

826
01:11:59,409 --> 01:12:02,079
- Maybe it's not just about you anymore.

827
01:12:04,956 --> 01:12:08,584
Listen. You listen to me.

828
01:12:08,585 --> 01:12:10,587
You see that city over there?

829
01:12:11,797 --> 01:12:14,340
That's where I'm supposed to be.

830
01:12:14,341 --> 01:12:16,634
Not down here with the
dogs, and the garbage,

831
01:12:16,635 --> 01:12:18,302
and the fucking last month's newspapers

832
01:12:18,327 --> 01:12:19,787
blowing back and forth!

833
01:12:21,723 --> 01:12:23,933
I've had it with them!

834
01:12:23,934 --> 01:12:25,184
I've had it with you.

835
01:12:25,185 --> 01:12:26,770
I've had it with all this!

836
01:12:29,564 --> 01:12:33,068
I want room service!

837
01:12:35,987 --> 01:12:37,822
I want the club sandwich!

838
01:12:37,823 --> 01:12:39,907
I want the cold Mexican beer!

839
01:12:39,908 --> 01:12:42,603
I want a $10,000—a—night hooker!

840
01:12:49,251 --> 01:12:51,002
I want my shirts laundered,

841
01:12:53,922 --> 01:12:57,509
like they do at the Imperial Hotel

842
01:13:01,179 --> 01:13:02,222
in Tokyo.

843
01:13:44,283 --> 01:13:45,451
We gotta see Jones.

844
01:13:47,387 --> 01:13:49,179
Spider sent us.

845
01:13:49,204 --> 01:13:50,204
Where's Spider?

846
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:52,790
- He's dead.

847
01:13:54,168 --> 01:13:56,920
Not in there. Earlier, at the hospital.

848
01:14:02,857 --> 01:14:05,442
If spider sent you, come on.

849
01:14:09,488 --> 01:14:10,614
Whoa!

850
01:14:12,019 --> 01:14:13,853
J-bone, help me.

851
01:14:13,878 --> 01:14:15,261
Come on. Keep it together.

852
01:14:19,011 --> 01:14:20,011
Come on.

853
01:14:40,783 --> 01:14:42,242
Hoist it up!
— need help, right here.

854
01:14:42,243 --> 01:14:43,243
You two.

855
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:47,790
I got him. I got him!

856
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:52,336
He'll be all right. Go on.

857
01:15:28,279 --> 01:15:30,321
Tell Shinji,
meet me at the bridge.

858
01:15:30,322 --> 01:15:31,991
He's on his way, sir.

859
01:15:34,189 --> 01:15:36,316
My helicopter?
— It's waiting, sir.

860
01:16:10,063 --> 01:16:13,774
- You okay?
- I'm alright.

861
01:16:19,131 --> 01:16:20,131
- I saw...

862
01:16:20,986 --> 01:16:21,987
I almost saw

863
01:16:23,823 --> 01:16:24,823
as if it was

864
01:16:27,451 --> 01:16:28,451
a memory.

865
01:16:40,183 --> 01:16:41,183
Ehmm...

866
01:16:41,394 --> 01:16:43,971
We have
a room especially for that.

867
01:16:48,796 --> 01:16:50,172
Time to meet Jones.

868
01:16:58,986 --> 01:17:02,267
We tapped into the main line,
get all the juice we need.

869
01:17:02,292 --> 01:17:03,812
Stored up, battery.

870
01:17:07,276 --> 01:17:10,654
We built heaven completely
out of straight—world junk,

871
01:17:10,655 --> 01:17:12,782
all hauled up here piece by piece.

872
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:20,874
We work with Spider and his people

873
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:23,044
and anybody else who's
fighting the system.

874
01:17:24,004 --> 01:17:25,297
We out shit for them.

875
01:17:26,965 --> 01:17:29,217
- What do you mean, "out?"

876
01:17:38,351 --> 01:17:41,604
Heaven, it's heart and soul.

877
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:51,483
This is where we fight back.

878
01:17:51,484 --> 01:17:52,943
We strip the little, pretty pictures

879
01:17:52,944 --> 01:17:54,820
from their 500—channel universe,

880
01:17:54,821 --> 01:17:58,657
recontextualize it, then we
spit the shit back at them.

881
01:17:58,658 --> 01:18:01,160
Special data, things that'll help people,

882
01:18:01,161 --> 01:18:02,704
like stuff we get from Spider.

883
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:05,706
We wide—band it.

884
01:18:05,707 --> 01:18:08,042
- Wide?
- Broadcast it. Go global.

885
01:18:08,043 --> 01:18:10,753
Bounce it off the satellites
that Jones hacks for us.

886
01:18:10,754 --> 01:18:12,504
The way the Navy got him hooked up,

887
01:18:12,505 --> 01:18:13,672
he cuts through hard encryption

888
01:18:13,673 --> 01:18:15,507
like a knife cuts through butter.

889
01:18:15,508 --> 01:18:17,176
- Code breaker. Good.

890
01:18:17,177 --> 01:18:19,554
I can't wait to meet him.
— right this way.

891
01:18:25,352 --> 01:18:26,935
Jones.

892
01:18:29,721 --> 01:18:31,029
It's a fish.

893
01:18:31,205 --> 01:18:32,572
It's a mammal.

894
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,683
He's a friend! He's a friend, sailor!

895
01:18:44,716 --> 01:18:46,982
Not only is he a mammal but he's a junkie.

896
01:18:49,267 --> 01:18:52,211
Navy got him all addicted to this
to make him work,

897
01:18:52,763 --> 01:18:55,907
I just give it to him so he thinks
he's still swimming... hehe.

898
01:19:01,286 --> 01:19:03,829
This was Spider's best bet?

899
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:06,291
Hey, one thing spider wasn't was stupid.

900
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:11,670
Jones is set up to sample
software from enemy subs,

901
01:19:11,671 --> 01:19:14,841
infrasound scan, right through the hull.

902
01:19:57,146 --> 01:19:59,648
Jones will feed you can opener codes.

903
01:19:59,649 --> 01:20:01,275
We'll try to get you out in time.

904
01:20:01,276 --> 01:20:03,444
Wait a minute. Have
you done this before?

905
01:20:04,821 --> 01:20:05,984
Has the fish?

906
01:20:09,033 --> 01:20:13,504
- How dangerous is this?
- Look... just keep your head still.

907
01:20:13,718 --> 01:20:17,078
Jones has to triangulate infrasound
into your implant

908
01:20:18,328 --> 01:20:19,579
If you move around too much,

909
01:20:20,559 --> 01:20:22,311
could microwave your frontal lobe.

910
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:27,440
Forget it.

911
01:20:28,401 --> 01:20:30,778
Look, man, at least you got a chance.

912
01:20:32,105 --> 01:20:33,105
It's up to you.

913
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:35,713
Do what you gotta do.

914
01:20:49,964 --> 01:20:52,345
Give me what you got
of the download codes.

915
01:21:02,939 --> 01:21:05,146
I will tell what sectors to hit.

916
01:21:05,713 --> 01:21:09,130
Use the rocket launcher only if we
loose the element of surprise.

917
01:21:09,442 --> 01:21:11,720
Fan out, prepare to go up!

918
01:21:11,845 --> 01:21:13,544
Lynch and Maroni, remain here.

919
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,082
Set up the broadcast antennas.

920
01:22:13,266 --> 01:22:16,762
Everybody... clear out of the
 infrasound zone.

921
01:22:21,216 --> 01:22:22,231
Now.

922
01:22:46,658 --> 01:22:48,865
Waste extra hours of this horse shit

923
01:22:53,787 --> 01:22:55,871
- Oh, you know, we were
just having a good time,

924
01:22:55,896 --> 01:22:57,062
just fooling around.

925
01:22:57,087 --> 01:22:58,875
Well, I don't wanna do nothing no more.

926
01:22:58,876 --> 01:23:00,336
And I don't care what it takes.

927
01:23:01,814 --> 01:23:03,399
Hear what I'm saying, buddy?

928
01:23:04,423 --> 01:23:08,384
Hey, buddy?

929
01:23:25,026 --> 01:23:26,026
Maroni!

930
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,029
Motherfuckers!

931
01:23:44,689 --> 01:23:46,357
Stations! You all know the drill!

932
01:24:04,533 --> 01:24:06,642
What did you get?
— we didn't get it.

933
01:24:08,635 --> 01:24:10,345
We're not gonna get it right now.

934
01:24:13,361 --> 01:24:15,237
The only way left is
to hack your own brain,

935
01:24:15,238 --> 01:24:17,114
and then loop it through Jones.

936
01:24:17,115 --> 01:24:18,950
- J-bone, the fuel tanks!

937
01:24:19,936 --> 01:24:21,229
Shit, it's the Yakuza.

938
01:24:23,022 --> 01:24:24,022
Give me that bow.

939
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:54,644
I was almost there.

940
01:24:54,645 --> 01:24:56,521
I could feel it starting to...

941
01:25:03,362 --> 01:25:04,488
Mr. Smith?

942
01:25:06,866 --> 01:25:07,908
Pharmakom?

943
01:25:10,119 --> 01:25:11,454
Not really.

944
01:25:20,546 --> 01:25:22,048
- You can't shoot me.

945
01:25:23,257 --> 01:25:24,300
Not in the head.

946
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:39,814
Takahashi!

947
01:25:39,815 --> 01:25:43,610
Do you know what this man
is carrying in his head?

948
01:25:43,611 --> 01:25:47,031
He's carrying the cure for NAS.

949
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:51,910
Your daughter died to protect
Pharmakom's profit margin.

950
01:25:51,911 --> 01:25:56,664
Treating the disease is far
more profitable than curing it.

951
01:25:56,665 --> 01:26:00,710
They had the cure eight
months ago, Takahashi.

952
01:26:00,711 --> 01:26:04,542
Pharmakom, the company that I created,

953
01:26:05,011 --> 01:26:06,675
let your daughter die.

954
01:26:27,154 --> 01:26:28,154
- Shinji.

955
01:26:32,993 --> 01:26:33,993
Hello, Johnny.

956
01:26:42,628 --> 01:26:43,628
Raise your chin.

957
01:26:44,755 --> 01:26:45,923
Let's make this clean.

958
01:28:04,767 --> 01:28:06,833
If I fall, you don't get the head, right?

959
01:28:07,283 --> 01:28:09,470
If you lose the head, you're fucked!

960
01:29:04,595 --> 01:29:05,884
- Jesus time.

961
01:30:15,287 --> 01:30:17,031
Jesus is waiting.

962
01:30:23,256 --> 01:30:24,632
- Come to Jesus.

963
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:41,887
The cure...

964
01:30:42,834 --> 01:30:47,571
The holiest of communions ...
and when i hold God's cure,

965
01:30:47,766 --> 01:30:49,901
- Jones!
- I  will be God!

966
01:30:50,084 --> 01:30:51,906
Please help me.

967
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:55,761
He's made you
the vessel of his mercy

968
01:30:55,786 --> 01:30:58,130
as I am the vessel of his wrath.

969
01:31:02,195 --> 01:31:03,655
- Jones...

970
01:31:06,855 --> 01:31:08,523
What spawn of Satan?

971
01:31:14,849 --> 01:31:15,849
Now!

972
01:32:07,162 --> 01:32:08,162
-Jane?

973
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:17,797
I'm all right.

974
01:32:29,309 --> 01:32:30,602
- Piece of shit.

975
01:32:31,811 --> 01:32:32,811
- Hook me up.

976
01:32:33,605 --> 01:32:34,605
The second image.

977
01:32:38,182 --> 01:32:39,182
Sit down.

978
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:41,281
- Get the power up.

979
01:33:12,396 --> 01:33:13,750
Johnny...

980
01:33:15,068 --> 01:33:17,362
I knew their secrets.

981
01:33:18,446 --> 01:33:19,446
The image...

982
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:24,368
The company has forgotten for me.

983
01:33:24,629 --> 01:33:26,588
Now they erase me,

984
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:29,524
burn me out of the mainframes,

985
01:33:30,339 --> 01:33:32,341
one memory after another.

986
01:33:33,592 --> 01:33:36,970
How very kind of them.

987
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:38,930
Johnny...

988
01:33:39,801 --> 01:33:42,901
The dolphin can take you into the data,

989
01:33:43,032 --> 01:33:45,505
find the third image.

990
01:33:48,683 --> 01:33:50,635
Johnny...

991
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:53,043
Look, if we gonna do this
download, we gotta do it now.

992
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:54,278
We're out of power.

993
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:04,555
Remember, we gotta loop
it through Jones. Johnny?

994
01:34:06,365 --> 01:34:07,927
Alright, let's get ready.

995
01:34:08,266 --> 01:34:10,434
Okay, let's do this.

996
01:34:10,435 --> 01:34:11,894
One problem, we do it the easy way--

997
01:34:11,895 --> 01:34:14,396
we get garbage because of the seige.

998
01:34:14,421 --> 01:34:16,733
Now if I loop it through Jones,
save the cure

999
01:34:17,703 --> 01:34:19,187
It will probably kill you.

1000
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:29,042
- Loop it.

1001
01:34:52,419 --> 01:34:53,670
Listen up, world.

1002
01:34:53,695 --> 01:34:56,155
This is the last blast from
Lotek world headquarters.

1003
01:34:56,156 --> 01:34:58,407
And believe this, we're
going out with a bang, baby.

1004
01:34:58,408 --> 01:35:01,160
So get your VCRs ready
because we got what you need.

1005
01:35:01,161 --> 01:35:03,412
We got the cure to NAS.

1006
01:35:03,413 --> 01:35:05,539
That's right, the cure
to the black shakes.

1007
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:08,292
And it's coming to you live
from the labs up at Pharmakom.

1008
01:35:08,293 --> 01:35:09,169
And believe this,

1009
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:11,628
they did not want you
to get this information.

1010
01:35:11,629 --> 01:35:14,799
So here it is, coming at you, Lotek style.

1011
01:35:21,297 --> 01:35:22,755
Watch you ass in there.

1012
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:24,904
No telling what Pharmakom stuck in there.

1013
01:35:24,943 --> 01:35:27,781
Might be Ice on it, virus programs.

1014
01:35:29,877 --> 01:35:31,036
Hit me.

1015
01:35:45,662 --> 01:35:50,401
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

1016
01:35:53,396 --> 01:35:56,573
Unauthorized interface attempt.

1017
01:36:00,537 --> 01:36:04,391
Lethal neural feedback now in effect.

1018
01:36:13,438 --> 01:36:17,682
Final warning: Do NOT attempt interface.

1019
01:36:24,271 --> 01:36:28,333
Final warning: Do NOT attempt interface.

1020
01:36:29,453 --> 01:36:31,068
He's doubling himself.

1021
01:36:44,318 --> 01:36:45,318
You...

1022
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:50,369
That's the double, don't worry.

1023
01:37:00,798 --> 01:37:03,172
The only way is to hack your own brain.

1024
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,250
Loop it.

1025
01:37:34,505 --> 01:37:39,984
Entrance code accepted.
Code accepted.

1026
01:37:56,506 --> 01:37:57,631
Send it out!

1027
01:39:34,243 --> 01:39:35,869
Happy Birthday, Johnny!

1028
01:39:35,870 --> 01:39:39,790
- Happy Birthday, Johnny.
- — thank you, mommy.

1029
01:40:33,763 --> 01:40:35,515
- It's payback time.

1030
01:40:53,446 --> 01:40:56,448
Just garbage. Get that outta here!

1031
01:41:49,021 --> 01:41:51,105
j' I can see j'

1032
01:41:51,106 --> 01:41:53,650
j' see the signs j'

1033
01:41:53,651 --> 01:41:56,110
j' I've been waiting here for you j'

1034
01:41:56,111 --> 01:41:58,112
j' I but nothing's getting through I j'

1035
01:41:58,113 --> 01:42:00,240
j' I am gone j'

1036
01:42:00,241 --> 01:42:03,284
j' up in the clouds j'

1037
01:42:03,285 --> 01:42:05,537
j' praying I can turn I

1038
01:42:05,538 --> 01:42:07,247
j' I turn myself around j'

1039
01:42:07,248 --> 01:42:09,457
j' a year ago j'

1040
01:42:09,458 --> 01:42:12,210
j' I gave it a year j'

1041
01:42:12,211 --> 01:42:14,754
j' I hoped it wouldn't happen j'

1042
01:42:14,755 --> 01:42:16,422
j' I now it's here j'

1043
01:42:16,423 --> 01:42:18,466
j' I it took so long j'

1044
01:42:18,467 --> 01:42:21,511
j' I can't carry on j'

1045
01:42:21,512 --> 01:42:23,972
j' I know the reason that you left me I j'

1046
01:42:23,973 --> 01:42:27,976
j' I you had nothing more to give me I j'

1047
01:42:27,977 --> 01:42:32,690
j' no more love j'

1048
01:42:42,199 --> 01:42:44,492
j' some nights I feel I j'

1049
01:42:44,493 --> 01:42:46,786
j' I like I have died j'

1050
01:42:46,787 --> 01:42:51,291
j' or something deep inside is dying j'

1051
01:42:51,292 --> 01:42:55,962
j' I try to understand my crimes j'

1052
01:42:55,963 --> 01:43:00,091
j' I but there's nothing
here that really matters I j'

1053
01:43:00,092 --> 01:43:02,010
j' I don't want to believe in you j'

1054
01:43:02,011 --> 01:43:07,224
j' I can't believe in you j'

1055
01:43:09,226 --> 01:43:11,603
j' I don't want to believe in you j'

1056
01:43:11,604 --> 01:43:16,817
j' I can't believe in you j'

1057
01:43:17,318 --> 01:43:21,904
j' I don't want it, I don't need it I

1058
01:43:21,905 --> 01:43:24,824
j' I don't want it I

1059
01:43:24,825 --> 01:43:30,039
j' I but I can't stop myself j'

1060
01:43:40,507 --> 01:43:45,721
j' mouth curling to a question Mark I j'

1061
01:43:48,807 --> 01:43:54,021
j' head back describes an arc j'

1062
01:43:56,899 --> 01:44:02,112
j' jaw's really slung, imprisoned words j'

1063
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:10,454
j' breath escaping, lips
long tightly sealed j'

1064
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:15,458
j' sentence is repealed j'

1065
01:44:15,459 --> 01:44:19,337
j' I left without obeying j'

1066
01:44:19,338 --> 01:44:23,508
j' internal is revealed j'

1067
01:44:23,509 --> 01:44:25,718
j' can't hear a word you're saying j'

1068
01:44:25,719 --> 01:44:30,933
j' this cell is so cold cold,
