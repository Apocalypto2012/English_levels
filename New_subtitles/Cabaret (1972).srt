In here...

15
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,963

The girls are beautiful.

17
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,720
Even the orchestra is beautiful.

18
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,560
Beautiful.

19
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,050
And now presenting...

Betty.

26

Each and every one a virgin.

27
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,450
You don't believe me?

28
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,162
Well, do not take my word for it.

29
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,289
Go ahead.

30
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,042
Ask Helga. Ha, ha, ha.

31
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,257
Outside it is windy...

32
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,052
...but here, it is so hot.

33
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:10,476
Every night we have the
battle to keep the girls from
taking off all their clothing.

34
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,814
So don't go away.

35
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,482
Who knows?

36
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,818
Tonight we may lose the battle.

Have you a cigarette, darling?
I am desperate!

57
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,387
Oh, yes.

58
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,473
- Yes, l think so.
- Oh, fantastic.

59
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,183
You're American.

60
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,810
Oh, God, how depressing.

61
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,312
You're meant to think
I'm an international woman of mystery.

62
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,814
Been working on it like mad, heh.

63
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,650
I was told there might be
a room to rent here.

64
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,235
Not too expensive, I...

65
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,279
I hope.

66
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,906
Divine decadence.

67
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,868
- I'm Sally Bowles.
- I'm Brian Roberts.

68
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,538
Come in, Brian darling.

69
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,793
Oh.

70
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,883
Oh, God, I've even begun
to think in German, heh.

71
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,676
- How long have you been here?
- Forever.

72
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,262
- How long is that?
- Almost three months.

73
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,515
It's the most marvellous boarding house.
Marvellous lodgers.

74
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,226
Everybody's broke, of course,
but who isn't these days?

75
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,897
Now, there's Fräulein Mayr,
who's a masseuse, for ladies only.

76
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,983
And there's Fräulein Kost,
who's a terribly sweet streetwalker.

77
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,158
Fräulein Kost, Fräulein Mayr.

78
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,207
Mayr tells Kost's fortune every morning.
And it's always the same.

79
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,920
"You'll meet a strange man," which under
the circumstances is a pretty safe bet.

80
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,176
Fräulein Kost's room.
Oh, you can just imagine.

81
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,054
Here it is, darling.

82
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,390
Oh.

83
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,810
Well, what else do you need
in a bedroom besides a bed?

84
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,898
Pupils. I've got to give English
lessons to pay the rent.

85
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,609
Well, look, you can use my room for that.

86
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,279
See? Practically a suite. Come on in.

87
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,866
You'll adore these.

88
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,409
Prairie oysters, darling.

89
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,747
It's an egg with Worcestershire sauce,
all sort of whooshed up together.

90
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,960
Fifty marks with breakfast,
even when I'm behind on the rent.

91
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,795
Divine, isn't it?

92
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,422
- Of course, I'm hardly ever in.
- Why not?

93
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,593
Oh, well, I dash all day
and l work late at the cabaret.

94
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:59,473
Now, these work instantly,
even on the most sinister hangovers.

95
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,269
Of course, I may bring a boyfriend home
occasionally, but only occasionally...

96
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,064
...because l do think that one ought
to go to the man's room if one can.

97
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,277
I mean, it doesn't look so much
as if one expected it, does it?

98
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,279
Exactly.

99
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,117
I see you've acquired a lot
of worldly wisdom.

100
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:22,913
Oh, not wisdom, darling, instincts.
I have ancient instincts.

101
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,166
And I have this strange, mystical...

102
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,377
...that-ish feeling about you.

103
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,714
So you're moving right in, okay?

104
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,133
- Okay?
- Heh.

105
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,467
Okay.

106
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,927
Prairie oysters?

107
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,020
Cheers.

108
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,401
Peppermint prairie oyster?

109
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,654
Oh, you got the toothpaste glass.

110
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,454

111
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,415

- The Kit Kat Klub.

112
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,542
A very beautiful young lady.

113
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,836
- She is so beautiful...
- She is so beautiful...

114
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,380
...and so talented, so...
...and so talented, so...

115
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:22,681
...charming, I have only yesterday said,
"I want you for my wife." Und she said:

116
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,976
"Your wife, what would she want with me?"

117
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:31,231
I give you that international sensation...

118
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,401
...Fräulein Sally Bowles.

119
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:56,673
You have to understand
The way I am, Mein Herr

120
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:01,011
A tiger is a tiger
Not a lamb, Mein Herr

121
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,809
You'll never turn the vinegar
To jam, Mein Herr

122
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,270
So I do
What I do

123
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,565
When I'm through
Then I'm through

124
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,027
And I'm through
Toodle-oo

125

But now it's over

And though I used to care
I need the open air

130

You're better off without me
Mein Herr

131
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,811
Don't dab your eye, Mein Herr
Or wonder why, Mein Herr

132

I've always said that l was a rover

133
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,943
You mustn't knit your brow
You should have known by now

134
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,947
You'd every cause to doubt me
Mein Herr

135
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:07,453
The continent of Europe
Is so wide, Mein Herr

136
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,915
Not only up and down
But side to side, Mein Herr

137
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:16,712
I couldn't ever cross it
If I tried, Mein Herr

138
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,299
But I do
What I can

139
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,968
Inch by inch
Step by step

140
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,722

165

Come over.

166
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,830
You know, you're really very good.

167
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,707
I know, darling, isn't it fabulous?

168
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,711
Listen, I want you to meet Fritz Wendel,
absolutely my oldest friend in Berlin.

169
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,755
- Brian Roberts.
- He's a divine playboy...

170
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,133
...hurtling from party to party,
seducing everyone in all directions.

171
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,969
You mustn't believe Sally.
I'm a serious man of business.

172
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,096
Making import-export with machineries.

173
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,306
Ha, heh.

174
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,727
Listen, Fritz is crazy to improve
his English so he can dazzle
fat American divorcees.

175
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,646
- Sally.
- And l said you might deign...

176
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,231
...to give him lessons. Yeah?

177
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,817
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

178
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,403
Darling, give me one of those cigarettes.

179
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,784
Oh, you've got to try one
of these. They're absolutely devastating.

180
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,161
I'm sure they're filled with opium
or something.

181
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,497
They make me feel wildly sensual.

182
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,760
She's hot stuff, yes?

183
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,262
No, thank you.

184
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,147
Oh, you're not mistaking me.
We do not sleep on each other.

185
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,651
That is correct? "On"?

186
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:11,113
- "With."
- "With." With.

187
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,787
72 kilos.

188
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,835
Her father, you know,
is a big ambassador from Washington.

189
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,212
- An ambassador?
- Oh, yes, dear chap.

190
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,300
And soon, with her, I think
I'm entering the high diplomatic circles.

191
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,053
Strict rules will be obeyed.

192
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,850
Sally tells me, sir,
that you're from Oxford University.

193
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,893
- A professor of language.
- Heh.

194
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,895
Well, it's, it's Cambridge, actually...

195
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,481
...and I'm still working
for my doctor of philosophy.

196
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,316
- That's why I'm here.
- Hmm.

197
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,278
But if you really want lessons,
I'd be pleased to help.

198
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,487
Excellent.

199
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,912
If it's.... If it's not too expensive.

200
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,415
You know, business is....
Business is terrible.

201
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,045
The inflation, the Communists, the Nazis.

202
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,425
Soon I am with a tin cup too...

203
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,011
...or I make a rich marriage.

204
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,930
That at least is sensible.

205
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,178
I suppose you're wondering
what I'm doing...

206
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,849
...working in a place
like the Kit Kat Klub.
- It is a rather unusual place.

207
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:47,769
That's me, darling,
unusual places, unusual love affairs.

208
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,690
I am a most strange
and extraordinary person.

209
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,865
Now, tell me all about you.
I want to hear everything.

210
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,575
Everything?

211
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,035
Absolutely everything.

212
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:10,166
Well, there's nothing
very dramatic to tell.

213
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,419
Since I've been down from Cambridge...

214
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:16,464
Lya De Putti.
Absolutely my favourite screen siren.

215
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,676
- Well, when I left Cambridge, I...
- I'm going to be a great film star.

216
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:24,973
That is, if booze and sex
don't get me first.

217
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,058
Do I shock you, darling?

218
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,435
Not a bit.

219
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:29,853
I don't?

220
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,065
Since mother died, we're even closer.

221
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,901
He's an ambassador, I understand.

222
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,236
Who told you that?
 Fritz Wendel.

223
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,196
Oh, Fritz.

224
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,033
He's practically an ambassador.

225
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,161
- Where is he now?
- Oh, who knows?

226
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,455
Timbuktu, outer Mongolia.

227
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:53,126
He dashes all over the globe
on momentous affairs of state.

228
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,963
Then you don't see much of him.

229
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,883
Oh, darling, what are you talking about?
Of course, I do.

230
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,093
He can't bear us being apart.

231
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,264
He's always swooping down
and carrying me off for divine vacations.

232
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,935
Hmm, the Riviera, Capri.

233
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,312
Have you ever slept with a dwarf?

234
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,066
Once, but it wasn't a lasting relationship.

235
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,238
Oh, I know I can sing,
but what I really want to be is an actress.

236
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,950
Like, uh.... Who is it?

237
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,910
Uh, Lya De Putti?

238
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:30,914
Oh, darling, come on.
I could act her right off the screen.

239
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,502
I thought you said she was your favourite.

240
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,629
She makes too many faces.

241
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,632
- No, please.
- We made an agreement.

242
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,843
Thank you.

243
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,762
Just you wait.

244
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,517
One of these days, Max Reinhardt
is going to drift into the club.

245
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,977
Well, you never know.

246
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,770
That's right, you never know.

247
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,022
It has happened before.

248
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,484
Why, just last week,
a man who's a very good friend...

249
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,238
...of the head of casting for UFA
asked me to sit at his table, and he's...

250
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:05,699
Oh.

251
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,493
- Oh, come on. Come on.
- What?

252
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,287
Run, run!

253
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,832
- Run!
 Why?

254
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,183
Oh.

255
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,151
Excuse me, miss...

256
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,070
...but didn't you just scream?

257
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,159
Does my company upset
you that much? Heh, heh.

258
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,412
You know, sometimes
l come down here and just wait.

259
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,539
I mean, just especially.

260
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,834
- You should try it sometime.
- Hm?

261
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,213
- Yes.
- Me?

262
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,050
- You.
- No.

263
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,510
- Yes, you.
- No.

264
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:10,305
- Oh, go on.
- I couldn't possibly.

265
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,432
Don't be so British.

266
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,977
- No.
- You'll feel terrific afterwards.

267
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,897
- No.
- You know you want to.

268
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:22,233
No, I don't. No.

269
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,529
- Here comes one now.
- No. Uh-uh.

270
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,074
- Will you do it?
- All right.

271
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,952
- Aah...
- No, no, not yet. Ha-ha-ha.

272
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,583
Okay, you ready?

273
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,211
Now.

274
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,708
Hoo, hoo, hoo!

275
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:37,725
Whoo!

276
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,649
I can't promise you anything,
but we can give it a try.

277
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,734
Darling, I want you to meet Herr Ludwig.

278
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,486
He's just back from Hamburg.

279
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,739
He lives in the room off the kitchen.
He's a marvellous publisher.

280
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,492
Look, he's got this book,
and it's got to be translated.

281
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,661
And I told him
what a famous writer you are.

282
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,455
- And it's 50 marks. Right?
 Mm-hm.

283
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,000
It's all settled.

284
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,669
It will be an honour for me
to associate with...

285
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:08,173
...so talented a young man of letters
as Miss Bowles tells me.

286
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,594
This book, I assure you, is most artistic.
Most artistic and colour...

287
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,055
- Twenty-five marks in advance. Right?
- Yeah, yeah.

288
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,348
Oh.

289
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,434
I think you will find the style...

290
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,102
Is there any hot water left?

291
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,272
- Hot water?
- Yes, yes, a little.

292
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,859
I think, Herr Roberts,
you will find the style admirable...

293
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:33,072
...and the subject matter,
l feel, is universal.

294
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,241
- Cigar?
- No, thank you.

295
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,494
No, no, you must. It's the finest Havana.

296
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,788
It's a deal?

297
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:46,044
Well, Herr Ludwig, I'm afraid that Sally's
rather overestimated my powers of....

298
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,548
It's a deal.

299
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,149
That's it.

300
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,654
Fifty marks. Not bad, huh?

301
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,324
Do you know what this artistic
and colourful book's about?

302
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,575
No. Tell, tell.

303
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,036
It's pure pornography.

304
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:24,457
But of course it is, darling.
All of Herr Ludwig's books are dirty books.

305
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,709
Hmm. What's this one called?

306
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:30,964
Hmm?

307
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,757
"Cleo, the Whip Lady."

308
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,136
Oh. Tsk.

309
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,180
You lied about the hot water.

310
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,015
I'm freezing.

311
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,685
I'm freezing to death.

312
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,395
Hug me?

313
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,190
Tighter.

314
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,609
Mm.

315
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,159
Brian, don't be so literal.

316
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:05,016
Doesn't my body
drive you wild with desire?

317
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,895
Well, doesn't it?

318
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,316
It's a very nice body.

319
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,860
Do you really think so, darling?

320
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,780
It does have a certain kind of style.

321
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,033
I mean, look, it's very flat here...

322
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,828
...not much hips, and...

323
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,040
...here....

324
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,212
It's a little early in the day
for this sort of thing, isn't it?

325
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,220
Maybe you just don't sleep with girls.

326
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,810
Oh. You don't.

327
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:56,651
Well, listen,
we're practically living together,
so if you only like boys...

328
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,404
...I mean, I wouldn't dream
of pestering you.

329
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:03,366
- Do you sleep with girls or don't you?
- Sally.

330
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,537
- You don't ask questions like that.
- I do.

331
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,792
All right.

332
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,044
If you insist.

333
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:16,754
I do not sleep with girls.

334
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,925
No, no, no.
Let me be absolutely accurate.

335
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:26,764
I've gone through the motions
of sleeping with girls exactly three times.

336
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,517
All of them disastrous.

337
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,690
The word for my sex life now is "nil."

338
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,443
Or as you Americans would say...

339
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,528
..."plenty of nothing."

340
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,075
All right?

341
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,713
Well, why didn't you tell me
in the first place?

342
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,675
Look, Brian...

343
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,303
...you're absolutely my best friend.

344
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,930
And friends are much harder to find
than lovers.

345
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:12,852
Besides, sex always screws up
a friendship, anyway, if you let it.

346
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:17,023
So we won't let it. Heh. Okay?

347
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,150
Okay?

348
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,236
Okay, Sally.

349
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,132
You would have been, he would
have been, we would have been...

350
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,384
...you would have been,
they would have been.

351
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,386
Pluperfect tense.

352
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,640
I have been... Being.

353
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,308
Oh, no, no, no.

354
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:56,395
If you did a little homework
instead of gadding about all over town....

355
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,315
Fräulein Schneider,
there's a new pupil coming at 3.

356
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,526
- Would you show her up, please?
 Certainly.

357
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,027
Oh, leave the door.

358
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,279
You had been being,
they had been being....

359
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,240
Future perfect.

360
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,367
I shall have....

361
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:12,036
I shall have been. This English.

362
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,373
I go now to try to pull a deal.

363
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,959
Or I make business soon...

364
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,877
...or I go as a gigolo.

365
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,881
- "Either, or."
- "Either, or," I go as a gigolo.

366
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:27,134
Anyway, who is the new pupil?

367
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,512
Natalia Landauer.

368
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,180
Landauer?

369
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,517
Of the big department store?

370
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,435
Uh-huh.

371
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,523
- A Landauer?
- Mm-hm.

372
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,901
How did you meet a Landauer?

373
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,071
I had a letter of introduction
from England.

374
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,948
They invited me for coffee.

375
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,117
Invited you for coffee?

376
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,498
Landauers are enormous rich Jews.

377
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,459
Stinking rich, it seems.

378
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,429
Good.

379
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,055
I shall make a pass after her.

380
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,893
What if she's fat and hideous?

381
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:28,487
Perhaps the father will take
a liking from me and give me a job.

382
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,782
If I marry her, a partnership perhaps.

383
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:36,495
- I'm not.... I'm not prejudiced.
- Hmm.

384
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,250
- Hello.
 You said you wouldn't be back till 4.

385
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:44,920
- I must have a drink this instant.
- Sally.

386
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,882
The new pupil's due at any moment.
Can't the drink wait?

387
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,343
Oh, God, only gin.

388
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,303
Sally, please.

389
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,640
Three marks an hour. I need it.

390
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,808
- We need it.
- All I need is a drink.

391
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,519
She's young and very
strictly brought up, so...

392
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,022
Look, I may have my tiny faults...

393
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,610
...but I'm really not planning
to white-slave her to Latin America.

394
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,153
Whose room is this, anyhow?

395
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:14,450
- Sally, in all fairness, you said...
- Fairness? Who cares about fairness?

396
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,167
Honestly.

397
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,135
Thank you.

398
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:35,680
You're welcome.

399
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:40,685
 Excuse me.
- How fat?

400
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,437
- Hmm?
- How fat?

401
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,947
Fräulein Landauer.

402
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,615
Oh, come in.

403
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,661
- Good afternoon, Fräulein Landauer.
Good afternoon.

404
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:01,580
How nice to see you again.
It's nice to see you again.

405
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,166
Ah, it is good, you have others.

406
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:07,378
So we shall make a party
for speaking English, yes?

407
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:11,382
Oh, well, actually,
my friends were just leaving.

408
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,844
No, no, no, I'm delighted to stay, Brian.

409
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,391
Sally, you have this appointment,
don't you?

410
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,601
I'll cancel it. I love parties.

411
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,062
Good, this is splendid for the practising.

412
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,690
You will introduce me, please.

413
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,900
Oh, yes, of course.

414
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,902
Herr Wendel, Fräulein Landauer.

415
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,699
No, no, English conversation.

416
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,201
I am so charmed, dearest miss.

417
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,954
And, uh, this...

418
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,749
...this is Miss Sally Bowles.

419
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,333
How do you do?

420
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:51,756
Bobby, a Landauer in my house.

421
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,597
Last summer when I....

422
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,348
I, uh....

423
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,059
I...

424
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,243
You are all healthy, I hope.

425
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,415
Yes.

426
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,794
I have had a cold, but it is better now.

427
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,295
Oh, good.

428
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,422
How sad.

429
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,759
A cold from the nose
is most aggravating.

430
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:40,471
This was a cold of the bosom,
not of the nose.

431
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,973
- Oh.
- All the "plegm" was here.

432
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,142
All the what?

433
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,312
The "plegm" that comes in the tubes.

434
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,648
I think I'm going to be sick.

435
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,945
"Phlegm." P-H is always
pronounced as F...

436
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,364
...and you don't sound the G.

437
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,491
Then why are they putting the G, please?

438
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:05,955
Heh, that's a very good question,
but rather difficult to explain.

439
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,164
Try, Bri.

440
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,213
Well, uh....

441
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,006
It's just there.

442
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,426
So Mr. Professor, you do not know?

443
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,178
No.

444
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,306
Then I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

445
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,854
It's most amusing.

446
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:32,690
Very amusing.

447
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,614
Oh, how thoughtful
of you, Fräulein Schneider.

448
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,824
Thank you very much.

449
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:44,618
You're most welcome, Herr Roberts.

450
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,833
Please.

451
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,964
Please, you must take a cake,
dearest miss.

452
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,049
I'm not eating between meals.

453
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,802
You're not eating between meals.

454
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,054
I am eating between meals.

455
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,228
Thank you. So much.

456
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,188
You're welcome.

457
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,152
Oh, Bri, Liebling, did I tell you?

458
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,863
I saw a film the other
day about syphilis.

459
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,073
Oh, it was too awful.

460
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,242
I couldn't let a man
touch me for a week.

461
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,536
Coffee?

462
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:31,916
- Is it true you can get it from kissing?
- Oh, yes.

463
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,251
And your king, Henry VIII...

464
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:37,421
...caught it from letting Cardinal Wolsey
whisper in his ear.

465
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,674
That is not, I think, founded in fact.

466
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:44,178
But from kissing, most decidedly.

467
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:48,098
And from towels and from cups.

468
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,020
And, of course, screwing.

469
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,276
"Screwing," please?

470
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,529
Oh, uh, fornication.

471
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,784
Fornication?

472
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,954
Oh, Bri, darling, what is the German word?

473
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,121
I don't remember.

474
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,331
Um....

475
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,293
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, no.

476
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,467
Oh.

477
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,221
That would be the one German word
you pronounce perfectly.

478
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:30,975
Well, I ought to. I spent the entire
afternoon "bumsening" like mad...

479
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:35,521
...with some ghastly old producer
who promised to give me a contract.

480
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,607
Gin, Miss Landauer?

481
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,696
Fritz is overdoing it a bit, isn't he?

482
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:47,157
Natalia's very rich.
Fritz is very broke.

483
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,495
That old heel-clicking, hand-kissing
routine won't get him anywhere with her.

484
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:55,040
The only thing to do with virgins
is to make a ferocious pounce.

485
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,252
Ha-ha, I can't imagine anyone
pouncing on Natalia.

486
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,547
That's why it would be
so effective, darling.

487
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,217
You are a woman of many
sexual experiences, I think.

488
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:09,221
I'll say, darling. Ever since l was so
high, men have found me irresistible.

489
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,557
- Daddy was always worrying that....
Yes?

490
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:12,766
You know.

491
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,894
How's the, uh, gigolo campaign going?

492
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,479
Terrible.

493
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,858
This week, already I'm giving up
three dinner invitations...

494
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,110
...to spend 32 marks on her.

495
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,029
- That's quite a sacrifice.
- Mm-hm.

496
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,655
And here is the craziness.

497
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,449
I like it.

498
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,411
- Goddamn it.
- What?

499
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,705
l think I'm falling in love with her.

500
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,081
I'm so sorry.

501
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,291
So am I.

502
00:39:57,771 --> 00:40:02,733
You assure me the English reader
will find this...

503
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:06,445
...arousing, stimulating?

504
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,155
Well, I, uh....

505
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,576
Yes, yes, I should think so.

506
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,454
Look, everybody.

507
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:18,499
Positively a nun's hands, aren't they?

508
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:22,920
- You look lovely, Sally.
- Just lovely.

509
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,092
Thank you. Well, I'm off to the Adlon...

510
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:33,055
...to see my sexy,
marvellous, devastating father.

511
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,058
Auf wiedersehen, my darlings.

512
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,895
Good luck.

513
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:48,570
Well, I'm terribly sorry, but I couldn't
possibly find any more of them.

514
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:54,284
Oh, good night, and thank you so much
for a delightful evening.

515
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,121
You're most welcome, Herr Roberts.

516
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,249
- Good night.
- Good night.

517
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,919
It really has been sublime.

518
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,505
Thank you.

519
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,215
Dearest miss.

520
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,111
You see how she is with me?

521
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,363
You see that kiss? You see that kiss?

522
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,782
No, I... I was too discreet to look back.

523
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,702
I think I go...
I go crazy with the frustration.

524
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:42,249
You know, I kiss and inside me
comes the explosion. But her?

525
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,044
Brian, I tell you a simple fact...

526
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,088
...and I'm not boosting.
- "Boasting."

527
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:52,759
Hmm. The French women,
the Swedish women, even the English...

528
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,179
...they go wild for my kisses, but...

529
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,307
...this one....

530
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:00,184
Nothing?

531
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,686
Nothing.

532
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:09,193
And I'm a crazy, lovesick fool.

533
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,696
Sally says you ought to pounce.

534
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,364
Pounce?

535
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,367
Oh, throw her on a couch or something.

536
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,620
To attack Natalia?

537
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,959
Well, Sally is rather knowledgeable
in these areas.

538
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,461
Sally.

539
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:31,965
You do what Sally says and you end up,
I think, in the prison cell.

540
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,931
Pounce, huh?

541
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,724
Pounce.

542
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,950
Sally?

543
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:04,831
How'd it go?

544
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,293
Bad?

545
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,964
Sally, what is it?

546
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,605
I waited at the Adlon till 10.

547
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,442
When I got back, there was this.

548
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,072
"Dear Sally:

549
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,617
Sorry, schedule revised at last minute.

550
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,953
Writing. Love."

551
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,291
Well, these things do happen.

552
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,335
- I'm sure he had a good reason.
- Hmm.

553
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,965
Ten words. Exactly.

554
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,385
After 10 it's extra.

555
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,305
You see, Daddy thinks of these things.

556
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:05,517
If I had leprosy, there'd be a cable.

557
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:09,646
"Gee, kid, tough.

558
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:14,818
Sincerely hope nose doesn't fall off.

559
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,112
Love."

560
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,827
That bastard!

561
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,495
I'll show him!

562
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:29,124
I'll become a big film star.

563
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:40,844
The poor man, he tries to love me.

564
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,764
Perhaps he even thinks he does.

565
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,351
But the real truth...

566
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:52,189
...is that he just doesn't care.

567
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:56,818
Maybe he's right.
Maybe I'm not worth caring about.

568
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:04,201
Maybe I am just nothing.

569
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:23,220
You're a perfectly marvellous girl.

570
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:24,721
Oh, no.

571
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,890
- And beautiful.
- No.

572
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:29,017
- And talented.
- No, I'm not.

573
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:32,062
Yes. Yes, you are.

574
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,656
Do you really think so?

575
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,408
- I mean, really?
- Yes.

576
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,535
Yes, I do.

577
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,498
Oh, thank you.

578
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,167
Oh, Brian.

579
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:48,388
Maybe this time I'll be lucky

580
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:53,477
Maybe this time he'll stay

581
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:05,071
Obviously those three girls...

582
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:09,075
...were the wrong three girls. Ha, ha, ha.
- Just the wrong three girls.

583
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:17,959
Maybe this time
For the first time

584
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:22,881
Love won't hurry away

585
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:28,553
Doesn't my body
drive you wild with desire?

586
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,431
Mm-hm.

587
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:37,562
He will hold me fast

588
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:43,610
I'll be home at last

589
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:50,116
Not a loser any more

590
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:56,248
Like the last time
And the time before

591
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:29,489
Everybody loves a winner

592
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:35,704
So nobody loved me

593
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:42,419
Lady Peaceful
Lady Happy

594
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:47,465
That's what l long to be

595
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:53,888
Well, all the odds are
They're in my favor

596
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:59,394
Something's bound to begin

597
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:05,942
It's got to happen
Happen sometime

598
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:10,196
Maybe this time I'll win

599
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:16,703
Cause everybody
Oh, they love a winner

600
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:22,751
So nobody loved me

601
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:28,506
Lady Peaceful
Lady Happy

602
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:33,136
That's what l long to be

603
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:39,351
Well, all the odds are
They're in my favour

604
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:44,731
Something's bound to begin

605
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:49,903
It's got to happen
Happen sometime

606
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:56,576
Maybe this time

607
00:49:56,744 --> 00:50:03,708
I'll win

608
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,040
- Hello?
- Hey, what's going on?

609
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:47,711
Brian. I'm sorry, Willi insisted.

610
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,714
Tell him your lover
is a gangster from Chicago.

611
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,382
Hmm.

612
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,446
- You told him?
- I did better than that.

613
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:18,825
I just told him that
I had the teeniest touch of syphilis.

614
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:26,916
Wait till he gets a load
of what little old Elke's got.

615
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,591
- Landauer?
- Yeah.

616
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,932
I am grateful to you that you
came to me from my call.

617
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,268
Don't be silly. I'm all agog.

618
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:55,111
- You will eat food, please?
- Oh, thank you.

619
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:06,247
- You see, Fräulein...
- Sally.

620
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,541
Sally.

621
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:13,421
Our acquaintance is not long,
but I am choosing you...

622
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:17,300
...because I know no other young woman
who is giving her body frequently to men.

623
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,056
Oh, my English.
I'm rending you an embarrassment?

624
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,392
No, no, I'm fascinated.

625
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,647
Fritz Wendel has declared love for me.

626
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,943
At first I not taking this seriously.

627
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,570
He is so....

628
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,240
So formal.

629
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,991
And also I think so much...

630
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:46,496
...the gigolo who hunts for the fortune.

631
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:49,123
Is that what you say?

632
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,417
That's what we say, all right. Heh.

633
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:53,461
Then...

634
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:56,381
...the night before yesterday...

635
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,008
...my parents are from the house...

636
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,886
...und we are seated here...

637
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,139
...upon my father's library sofa.

638
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:06,516
Suddenly...

639
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,686
...he throws aside the formalities...

640
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:13,523
...there is fire, there is passion.
- Oh, my God.

641
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,525
- He pounced.
- Please?

642
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,653
He....

643
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,446
He made love to you.

644
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,366
On my father's library sofa.

645
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:26,411
Und even for that,
he is showing no respect.

646
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:31,040
I am fighting,
I'm calling out harsh words, but then....

647
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,377
May we not be frank?

648
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:37,297
Suddenly...

649
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,677
...all is equal fire...

650
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:45,179
...equal passion in me.

651
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:50,727
And since then, I think only of him.

652
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,397
Now, is this love...

653
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,567
...or mere fatuation of the body?

654
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,820
You, with so many, as you call,
"screwings"...

655
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:04,073
...shall please tell me the truth of it.

656
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:14,834
Please.

657
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,380
Heh. Does it matter?
As long as you're having fun.

658
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,758
How can you speak of fun?

659
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,509
He has asked me to marry him.

660
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,554
Well, that's wonderful. Why don't you?

661
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:32,435
And say to my father that I am marrying
a man who is perhaps a fortune hunter?

662
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,271
And a Christian too.

663
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,775
Oh, this, I think, is breaking his heart.

664
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:44,364
Well, in that case, I guess
you better just forget the whole thing.

665
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,324
Forget Fritz?

666
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:50,703
- How am I ever forgetting Fritz?
- Look, I really have to be running along.

667
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,290
Oh, no.

668
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,043
Don't cry.

669
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:00,421
Oh, please, don't cry.

670
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:03,925
I'm no good at all if anybody cries.

671
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:09,931
Natalia, about Fritz pouncing...

672
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,600
...you see, I thought....

673
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,814
I didn't think....

674
00:55:19,108 --> 00:55:22,610
How shall so grave a problem
resolve itself?

675
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,905
You poor thing.

676
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,701
You can't marry him.
You can't give him up.

677
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:34,789
I don't suppose you'd ever consider
seeing him on the sly every now....

678
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,667
No, I didn't think so.

679
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:44,007
My God, it's enough
to drive a girl into a convent.

680
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,011
Do they have Jewish nuns?

681
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:11,951
What?

682
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,328
I think you dropped this.

683
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,205
Yes, thank you.

684
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:25,715
- Yes, but...
- Excuse me, may I help you?

685
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:29,761
I want...
I want my laundry back by Tuesday.

686
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:36,434
Well, it's okay.

687
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:39,062
Thank you so much.

688
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,230
Maximilian von Heune.

689
00:56:41,774 --> 00:56:43,483
Sally Bowles.

690
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:49,072
Do you have a cigarette?
I'm absolutely desperate.

691
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,741
I must have left mine at the club.

692
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,493
The Kit Kat Klub.

693
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,455
Divine decadence.

694
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,543
May I drop you somewhere?
I have my car outside.

695
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,378
All right.

696
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,090
Auf wiedersehen, darling.

697
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:15,223
Money.

698
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,850
Money makes the world go around

699
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:20,561
The world go around
The world go around

700
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:25,775
Money makes the world go around
It makes the world go round

701
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:28,361
A mark, a yen, a buck or a pound

702
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:30,947
- A mark, a yen, a buck or a pound
- A buck or a pound

703
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:32,949
Is all that makes the world go around

704
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:39,122
That clinking, clanking sound
Can make the world go round

705
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,917
Money, money, money
Money, money, money

706
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:46,129
If you happen to be rich
And you feel like a night's entertainment

707
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,713
You can pay for a gay escapade

708
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,591
If you happen to be rich and alone
And you need a companion

709
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,343
You can ring, ding-a-ling, for the maid

710
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:55,471
If you happen to be rich
And you find you are left by your lover

711
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,390
And you moan and you groan quite a lot

712
00:57:57,558 --> 00:58:00,268
You can take it on the chin
Call a cab and begin to recover

713
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,770
- On your 14-carat yacht
- What?

714
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,897
Money makes the world go around

715
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,525
The world go around
The world go around

716
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:08,860
Money makes the....

717
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,780
Go around
Of that we both are sure

718
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,574
On being poor

719
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:20,788
Money, money, money
Money, money, money

720
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:41,601
Money, money, money
Money, money, money

721
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:49,275
Money, money, money

722
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:06,542
Money, money, money
Money, money, money

723
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,170
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money

724
00:59:09,338 --> 00:59:10,546
Money, money, money, money

725
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,591
When you haven't any coal in the stove
You freeze in the winter

726
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:15,551
And you curse to the wind at your fate

727
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,721
When you haven't any shoes on your feet
Your coat's thin as paper

728
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,473
And you look 30 pounds underweight

729
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:23,517
When you go to get a word of advice
From the fat little pastor

730
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,228
He will tell you to love evermore

731
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,731
But when hunger comes to rap
Rat-a-tat, rat-a-tat at the window

732
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,234
- At the window.
- Who's there?

733
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,319
- Hunger.
- Oh, hunger!

734
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,322
See how love flies out the door

735
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:40,368
Money makes the world go around
The world go around, the world

736
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:46,165
Money makes the world go around
The clinking, clanking sound

737
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,751
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money

738
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,379
Get a little, get a little
Money, money, money, money

739
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:55,383
A mark, a yen, a buck or a pound
That clinking, clanking, clunking sound

740
00:59:55,550 --> 01:00:01,264
ls all that makes the world go round
It makes the world go round

741
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,519
It's called Türkenblut.

742
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:51,605
"Turk's blood." A famous German drink.

743
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,566
Oh.

744
01:00:56,278 --> 01:01:00,448
Ah, it's divine.
I'll never drink anything else.

745
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,788
Prost, my friend.

746
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:14,712
Well, mes enfants,
you are, like me, adrift in Berlin.

747
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,007
I think it's my duty to corrupt you.
Agreed?

748
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,182
Fascinating.

749
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,683
Let's go to the Kempinski.

750
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,519
Darling, he's a baron.

751
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:33,189
He never even told me.

752
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:35,483
Class.

753
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,693
He must know everybody.

754
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:42,031
I bet a man like that could
get me into films faster than
you can say Erich von Stroheim.

755
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,866
In exchange for a little infidelity.

756
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,535
A little infidelity? Idiot.

757
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,330
Don't worry, I can handle him.

758
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,883
Trust me. Just trust me, darling.

759
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,387
All right, don't trust me.

760
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,674
I had a marvellous time last night.

761
01:02:45,804 --> 01:02:47,221
So did I.

762
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:06,449
Darling.

763
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,117
- Darling.
- Hmm?

764
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:10,286
Bri, darling, wake up.

765
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:14,415
We have a visitor. Maximilian's here.

766
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,757
Three-thirty. Heh.
Sorry, Brian, we're late.

767
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,885
Oh, darling,
we had the most glorious time.

768
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,554
We didn't stop laughing, heh.
- Don't open your eyes.

769
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:31,098
Don't look. Okay.

770
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:34,643
Isn't it fabulous? Oh!

771
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,354
- I feel just like Kay Francis.
- Heh, heh, heh.

772
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:41,984
Oh, Bri, why didn't you come?
We had the best time. It was so much fun.

773
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:46,447
- Max really knows how to corrupt a girl.
- I try.

774
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,159
Not only did l get this glorious pelt...

775
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,661
...I got perfume, I got silk stockings...

776
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,788
And you got that funny little blue hat.

777
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,499
Oh, you call it funny.

778
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,459
I think it's divine. I love it.

779
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,296
Oh, God,
we didn't get anything for Brian.

780
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:10,513
I'm afraid l had no time
to have it wrapped.

781
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:13,849
Darling, isn't that beautiful?

782
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,186
What on earth makes you think
I'd accept that?

783
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:22,233
- To give me pleasure.
- Max loves buying things.

784
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,655
Brian, you're a man
of strong convictions.

785
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:30,407
Can we have caviar again?

786
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,535
But you had it for breakfast.

787
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:35,287
Can I have it for lunch?

788
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,873
For lunch, for dinner, breakfast again.
Anything you want.

789
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:43,546
Uh, dry caviar, bitter.

790
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,091
That's for me. What are you having?

791
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,971
The lady, with the thing...

792
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,849
And we were in the car and she came...

793
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:01,730
You should have been there.

794
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,365
The Nazis are just a gang of
stupid hooligans...

795
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,117
...but they do serve a purpose.

796
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:17,246
Let them get rid of the Communists.
Later we'll be able to control them.

797
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:21,584
- But who exactly is "we"?
Germany, of course.

798
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:25,045
Hey, Max, can we go to the Bristol Bar?

799
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:26,589
- Why not?
- Oh, wonderful.

800
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,674
I'm dying to show off my new coat.

801
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,343
I think I could do with a drink too.
Good.

802
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,721
We'll make a night of it.
Or why not a weekend?

803
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:40,519
Berlin makes strange bedfellows
these days.

804
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:44,607
Some people have one people.
Some have two.

805
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,401
Some even....

806
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,405
Two ladies

807
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:53,949
Two ladies

808
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,954
Und I'm the only man, ja

809
01:06:00,332 --> 01:06:01,373
I like it

810
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:04,168
They like it

811
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:06,795
This two-for-one

812
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,092
Two ladies

813
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,637
Two ladies

814
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:18,932
- And he's the only man
- Yeah

815
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,435
I like it

816
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:24,104
We like it

817
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,108
This two-for-one

818
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,076
I do the cooking

819
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,285
Ah!

820
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:39,870
I make the beds

821
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:44,166
I go out daily to earn our daily bread

822
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:47,461
- But we've one thing in common
- He

823
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,171
- She
- Und me

824
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,799
- The key
- Diddily-dee

825
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:54,301
The key

826
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:56,136
Ooh!

827
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:01,183
Come on, come on.

828
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,979
Whoo!

829
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:11,527
Two ladies

830
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:17,032
- Und he's the only man
- Yeah

831
01:07:30,422 --> 01:07:32,423
Whoo! Ha, ha, ha!

832
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:45,728
We switch partners daily
To play as we please

833
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:51,066
- Twosies beats onesies
- But nothing beats threes

834
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,402
I sleep in the middle

835
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,529
- I'm left
- Und I'm right

836
01:07:55,697 --> 01:08:00,868
But there's room on the bottom
If you drop in some night

837
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,370
Two ladies

838
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:04,580
Come on.

839
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,836
Und I'm the only man, ja

840
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:13,255
I like it

841
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:15,883
They like it

842
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,677
This two-for-one

843
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:46,622
- What'd he say?
- He's asking about his asthma.

844
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,500
Miss Bowles in Mother's room, I thought.

845
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,376
Mr. Roberts in the blue room.

846
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,850
No, no, help yourself.

847
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,477
Please.

848
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:54,064
I'm not quite sure,
but l think they're mine.

849
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,984
This used to be my room
before I was married.

850
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,280
Heh, looks familiar.

851
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:04,074
You can at least get out of that shirt.

852
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:06,535
Try this one. Blue should be your colour.

853
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:12,374
Brian, not even a sweater?

854
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,547
Are you still married?

855
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:21,800
Very much so.

856
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:32,728
- Where is your wife now?
- In Cologne.

857
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:36,481
For the culture.

858
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:39,234
She lends her support to the arts.

859
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:43,405
She in her way, I in mine.

860
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,368
We have quite a special understanding.

861
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,329
That must be useful at times.

862
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,082
What about these?

863
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:00,881
I was right. Blue is your colour.

864
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:18,690
My dear Stephanie,
I would never desert you.

865
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:21,193
I find it very interesting.

866
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:24,613
Your father must be
a very important man, Miss Bowles.

867
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:27,616
Oh, I'll say, darling.
He's practically an ambassador.

868
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:31,244
We have the most
marvellous relationship.

869
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:35,248
The instant he can tear himself away,
he dashes to wherever I am.

870
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:40,545
Oh, it's excellent, excellent.
But the food here is always good.

871
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,800
Excuse me, but didn't we meet with
Emil Jannings at UFA last winter?

872
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:47,260
- I don't...
- You do know Emil, don't you?

873
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:49,763
Ah, I find him trés amusant.

874
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,649
Money.

875
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,818
Ha, ha, ha.
Be careful!

876
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,362
Clara Bow.

877
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:08,991
- That's not Clara Bow.
- It's early Clara Bow.

878
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,536
Wait, I got one. I got one.

879
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,499
Late Sally Bowles. Ha, ha, ha.

880
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,501
You said it.

881
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,712
You two are marvellous.

882
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,296
Have you ever been to Africa?

883
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:25,716
Where, mein Schatz?

884
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:27,342
Africa.

885
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,345
Let's go, the three of us. Smile, Brian.

886
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:41,189
- Sally, you're really talented.
- What?

887
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:44,526
You're talented.
- Oh!

888
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,489
He wants to take us to Africa.

889
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:55,370
He must be insane.

890
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:01,209
More! Come on, please!
More, more, more! Please!

891
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,502
- That's all.
More!

892
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,839
- More, please!
- More! More!

893
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:13,513
- Come on, Max.
- No, no. No.

894
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:14,848
Oh, please?

895
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:18,769
Oh, bravo, bravo.

896
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:44,753
Hey.

897
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,006
The king of the jungle.

898
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,302
Hey, Brian, you all right?

899
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,930
- Sorry.
- Oops.

900
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:21,766
It's all right, darling.

901
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,310
You okay?

902
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,570
Oh, darling.

903
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:15,695
Mombasa's quite wonderful, really.

904
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:18,531
I mean, the way ports are
all over the world.

905
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:21,076
- Sounds absolutely exotic.
Heh, heh, heh.

906
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:23,411
All the way through
Tanganyika and Uganda.

907
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,330
Sure?

908
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,959
Sally, champagne? Hmm?

909
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,675
Every now and then,
the train stops in the middle of nowhere...

910
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:40,428
...and right there is a family of giraffes,
nibbling the trees...

911
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:44,266
...or a herd of zebra
galloping off in a cloud of dust.

912
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,560
And when the flamingos come in,
thousands and thousands of them...

913
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:49,729
...turning the whole sky pink.

914
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,439
You'll be amazed when you see it.

915
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:56,820
Hey! Hey, Sally.

916
01:16:56,988 --> 01:17:00,115
- Are you quite comfortable?
- Hmm.

917
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,452
Come on.

918
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,745
- Oh!
- Ha, ha, ha.

919
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,437
Sally has an endearing charm...

920
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:34,190
...but I must admit I find it peaceful
when she's taking her nap. Heh, heh.

921
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:09,809
To Africa.

922
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:22,489
The sun on the meadow Is summery warm

923
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:29,621
The stag in the forest runs free

924
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:33,208
But gather together

925
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:37,045
To greet the storm

926
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:44,219
Tomorrow belongs to me

927
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:51,601
The branch of the linden
Is leafy and green

928
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:58,733
The Rhine gives its gold to the sea

929
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:05,698
But somewhere a glory awaits unseen

930
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:12,831
Tomorrow belongs to me

931
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:20,505
The babe in his cradle is closing his eyes

932
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:26,886
The blossom embraces the bee

933
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:33,935
"But soon," says a whisper, "arise, arise"

934
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:40,692
Tomorrow belongs to me

935
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:45,947
Oh, fatherland, fatherland
Show us the sign

936
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:51,911
Your children have waited to see

937
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:57,584
The morning will come
When the world is mine

938
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:03,465
Tomorrow belongs
Tomorrow belongs

939
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:09,387
Tomorrow belongs to me

940
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:15,310
Oh, fatherland, fatherland
Show us the sign

941
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:20,648
Your children have waited to see

942
01:20:21,192 --> 01:20:26,571
The morning will come
When the world is mine

943
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:32,285
Tomorrow belongs
Tomorrow belongs

944
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:37,916
Tomorrow belongs to me

945
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:43,755
Tomorrow belongs
Tomorrow belongs

946
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:47,383
Tomorrow belongs to me

947
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:49,469
Do you still think you can control them?

948
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:55,183
Oh, fatherland, fatherland
Show us the sign

949
01:20:55,351 --> 01:21:00,855
Your children have waited to see

950
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:06,528
The morning will come
When the world is mine

951
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:12,534
Tomorrow belongs
Tomorrow belongs

952
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:21,918
Tomorrow belongs to me

953
01:21:30,553 --> 01:21:34,013
- Natalia.
- Fritz, you frightened me.

954
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:36,015
I'm sorry, but I must speak to you.

955
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:39,852
No, no, go away. Please, go away.
I told you not to come.

956
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,062
Natalia, please.

957
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,274
The situation is impossible.

958
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,568
We must not see each other any more.

959
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:49,070
Is it the money? Is it that?

960
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:03,293
I did think it was the money at first.

961
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,086
But not now.

962
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,088
Now l know that you love me.

963
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:11,342
I know you are an honest man
who would never, never lie to me.

964
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:16,764
Natalia, I beg of you, marry me.

965
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,020
I can't.

966
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:26,107
Is it your parents? Isn't it?

967
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,734
It's not my parents. It is me.

968
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:31,070
It is you too.

969
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:35,867
Fritz, be careful!

970
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:39,996
What am l doing?

971
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:43,708
I've never jumped
on a running board before.

972
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:45,835
Are you all right?

973
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,840
Why won't you marry me?

974
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:55,470
Don't you see what is happening
in Germany today?

975
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:57,722
I'm a Jew.

976
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:58,973
You are not.

977
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:04,646
Goodbye, dear Fritz.

978
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:08,418
Hmm.

979
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:11,838
I told Schneider we'd be gone
for at least two months, maybe more.

980
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:15,133
She cried and cried
and said she'd miss us.

981
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,385
The only reason she was crying
is she knows...

982
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:21,431
...she can't get 50 marks
a month from anybody else
for these pitiful little rooms.

983
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:22,640
You know:

984
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:25,226
Money makes the world go around
The world go...

985
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:29,397
Where have you been?
I've been packing for hours.

986
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:33,818
Have some champagne, darling.
Compliments of Max.

987
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:37,864
Oh, your laundry came back.
It's over there on the bed.

988
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:42,118
You know, Bri, it occurred to me.

989
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,996
I know I've handled Max brilliantly...

990
01:24:45,164 --> 01:24:47,582
...but enough with the African moon.

991
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,667
I mean, it would be funny, wouldn't it...

992
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:53,796
...if he asked me to become the next
Baroness von Heune und Regensburg?

993
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:58,634
I've been looking for that for months.
I mean, stranger things have happened.

994
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:03,848
I wouldn't dream of accepting him,
of course.

995
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,519
For God's sake,
I wish you could hear yourself sometimes.

996
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:11,105
I mean, really hear yourself.

997
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:13,608
Christ!

998
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:21,073
Aren't you ever going to stop
deluding yourself? Hmm?

999
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:22,450
"Handling Max."

1000
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:27,371
Behaving like some ludicrous
little underage femme fatale.

1001
01:25:27,915 --> 01:25:32,543
You're about as fatale
as an after-dinner mint.

1002
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,800
Oh, heh.

1003
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:42,970
Well, darling, we all know...

1004
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:46,641
...about your vast experiences
with les femmes...

1005
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:48,976
...fatales or otherwise.

1006
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:53,648
Look, why don't you just
come out with it?

1007
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:59,070
You can't stand Maximilian
because he's everything that you're not.

1008
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:02,949
He doesn't have to give English lessons
for 3 marks an hour.

1009
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,158
He's rich.

1010
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:08,329
And he knows about life.
He doesn't read about it in books.

1011
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:14,043
He's suave and he's divinely sexy.

1012
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:17,296
And he really appreciates a woman.

1013
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:20,174
Oh, screw Maximilian!

1014
01:26:21,552 --> 01:26:23,094
I do.

1015
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,356
So do I.

1016
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:56,210
You two bastards!

1017
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:02,884
Two?

1018
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:06,220
Shouldn't that be three?

1019
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:27,283
I think your paper and your party
are pure crap, sir.

1020
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:29,952
I said:

1021
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,581
And so are you.

1022
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:57,104
I hear you took on the entire
Nazi party single-handed.

1023
01:27:59,483 --> 01:28:01,567
Only two? Ha, ha, ha.

1024
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:09,617
- Sounds like "cigarette"?
- Hmm.

1025
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:16,624
- Feel up to a little surprise?
- Hm.

1026
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:28,302
You poor thing, you're blind.

1027
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,262
Here.

1028
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:34,558
"Dear Sally and Bri."
ln that order, please note.

1029
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:40,189
"I know you will forgive me,
but family affairs make it imperative...

1030
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,483
...for me to leave for Argentina
immediately.

1031
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:45,486
It was fun, wasn't it?" Heh.

1032
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:47,989
Signed, "Maximilian."

1033
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,782
Argentina, my ass.

1034
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:53,369
Oh, he also sent this.

1035
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:55,287
Three hundred marks.

1036
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:57,331
For the two of us.

1037
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,835
It's ℳ150 each.

1038
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,340
Let's see, on an hour-to-hour basis...

1039
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:10,386
...that puts us about on a par
with Fräulein Kost. Heh, heh.

1040
01:29:12,681 --> 01:29:15,182
Some gold-diggers, aren't we?

1041
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:16,767
Hmm.

1042
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,690
- Oh, Brian, I'm so sorry.
- Shh.

1043
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:31,615
- Oh, darling.
- Oh!

1044
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:47,214
Whoo!

1045
01:29:58,643 --> 01:29:59,894
- Whee!
- Whoo!

1046
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:16,071
Hello.

1047
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:22,536
Something the matter?

1048
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:29,376
What is it, Sally? What's happened?

1049
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:32,963
Goddamn it, I'm going to have a baby!

1050
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:39,053
Well, aren't you going to ask?

1051
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:40,721
All right.

1052
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:43,682
- Whose is it?
- I don't know!

1053
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,561
I really don't know.

1054
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:51,649
- What are you going to do?
- Obviously, I can't have it.

1055
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:54,777
The doctor I went to said he'll do it.

1056
01:32:55,362 --> 01:32:56,403
But it's expensive.

1057
01:32:56,571 --> 01:33:01,784
He has to bribe somebody
or other for some kind of
a certificate or something.

1058
01:33:01,952 --> 01:33:04,036
Oh, I don't know.

1059
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:07,581
Well, there goes my fur coat.

1060
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:56,714
I would like to marry you.

1061
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:01,719
Eggs.

1062
01:34:01,928 --> 01:34:04,513
- A touch of toothpaste.
- Naturally.

1063
01:34:04,681 --> 01:34:06,849
 A lot of gin.
- Ha, ha, ha.

1064
01:34:07,017 --> 01:34:08,517
All whooshed up together.

1065
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:14,273
With this spiked prairie oyster,
I thee wed.

1066
01:34:14,441 --> 01:34:16,400
To the future.

1067
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:20,321
With any luck,
I'll get a fellowship at King's.

1068
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:22,531
Oh, dear, what's that?

1069
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:24,616
My college at Cambridge.

1070
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:28,370
- You'll absolutely love it there.
- Oh, I know I will.

1071
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:34,668
- It's crazy.
- What?

1072
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:39,089
Me. Wanting to be an actress. Heh, heh.

1073
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:47,097
I guess babies love you automatically,
don't they?

1074
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,353
They don't have much of a choice.

1075
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:02,321
- To you and the baby.
- To me and the baby.

1076
01:35:07,369 --> 01:35:09,578
Probably is yours.

1077
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,956
But I don't suppose
we'll ever know for sure.

1078
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:17,503
So what?

1079
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:23,175
You sure you won't mind?

1080
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:24,551
Honestly?

1081
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:27,346
Honestly.

1082
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:32,142
Oh, Bri.

1083
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:36,480
- To me and the baby.
- To you and the baby.

1084
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:42,361
To you. You.

1085
01:35:42,529 --> 01:35:45,072
Me? To me.

1086
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,740
- And the baby.
- And the baby.

1087
01:35:49,411 --> 01:35:51,578
Mm, mm.

1088
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:55,207
- Oh, where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

1089
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,043
- Brian!
- Hmm?

1090
01:35:58,211 --> 01:36:02,256
You are a most strange
and extraordinary person.

1091
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:03,757
I know, I know.

1092
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:13,559
The proud father.

1093
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:15,245
Good lord, Fritz.
You're on time. I can't believe it.

1094
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:17,372
How's Natalia?

1095
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:20,792
Please, I do not speak of Natalia.

1096
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,754
- Bad as that?
- Bad.

1097
01:37:23,922 --> 01:37:25,756
Perhaps I cut myself at the throat.

1098
01:37:25,924 --> 01:37:28,675
Uh-huh. Prepositions, Fritz. Prepositions.

1099
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:30,177
"ln the throat"?

1100
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:32,429
No, just "cut my throat."

1101
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:35,349
And I assure you...

1102
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,852
...they're all in it together.

1103
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:43,941
If all the Jews are bankers,
then how can they be Communists too?

1104
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:45,150
Subtle.

1105
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:47,694
Very subtle, Fräulein Kost.

1106
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:50,656
If they can't destroy us one way...

1107
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:55,452
...they try the other.

1108
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:57,871
You don't really believe that, do you?

1109
01:37:58,665 --> 01:38:01,542
But you read it every day
in the Völkischer Beobachter.

1110
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:05,504
That ridiculous Nazi tripe.

1111
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:08,674
It is an established fact, Herr Roberts...

1112
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:14,054
...that there exists a well-organized
international conspiracy...

1113
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:17,808
...of Jewish bankers and Communists.

1114
01:38:19,435 --> 01:38:21,728
It's also an established fact,
Herr Ludwig...

1115
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:26,066
...there exists another well-organised
group of which you're obviously a member.

1116
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:30,404
The International Conspiracy
of Horses' Asses.

1117
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:36,743
I wish the Kaiser was back.

1118
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:39,580
In those days we had order.

1119
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:43,875
I expect Schneider will raise my rent
after that little exhibition.

1120
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:47,212
Oh, well, what the hell?

1121
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:49,590
Let's get on with those prepositions.

1122
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:53,135
What a black day
that I'm meeting that girl!

1123
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,430
I thought you loved her.

1124
01:38:56,598 --> 01:38:59,850
Love, love,
who's needing verdammtes love?

1125
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:02,894
You want to hear the big joke on me?

1126
01:39:03,521 --> 01:39:05,355
You want to hear it?

1127
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:09,067
I am a Jew.

1128
01:39:10,236 --> 01:39:13,947
- So?
- To be a Jew in Germany?

1129
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:16,617
Only a fool is this, I think.

1130
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:21,955
So I come to Berlin and I'm not a Jew.

1131
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:23,415
How did you manage that?

1132
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:27,127
Where it says on my papers "religion"...

1133
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:30,505
...I am writing "Protestant."

1134
01:39:30,673 --> 01:39:33,550
So the work comes.

1135
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:35,677
The friends come.

1136
01:39:36,137 --> 01:39:38,055
The parties come.

1137
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:40,390
The parties.

1138
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:45,062
My God, whoever dreams
that l shall fall in love
with a Jewish girl?

1139
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:47,981
Heh. But surely that solves your problem.

1140
01:39:48,524 --> 01:39:51,485
- All you've got to do is tell her...
- Do you understand nothing?

1141
01:39:51,653 --> 01:39:53,320
This girl!

1142
01:39:55,657 --> 01:39:58,950
Do you know what she has done to me?

1143
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:01,161
It's terrible.

1144
01:40:02,789 --> 01:40:05,832
She has turned me into an honest man.

1145
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:08,919
"Oh, you're good," she says.

1146
01:40:09,087 --> 01:40:13,090
"A man of integrity
who will never lie to me."

1147
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:19,346
What does she do if I tell her now?

1148
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:22,808
I tell you what she does if I tell her now.

1149
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:25,644
She kicks me out into the streets.

1150
01:40:25,895 --> 01:40:30,107
Oh, don't be silly. She'd understand.

1151
01:40:31,526 --> 01:40:33,360
Anyway, what have you got to lose?

1152
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:37,155
What do I lose?
She kicks me out into the streets.

1153
01:40:37,323 --> 01:40:40,534
All my friends hear I'm a Jew,
they kick me out into the streets.

1154
01:40:40,702 --> 01:40:45,831
And then, I think, comes a big Nazi
with a club and bangs me on the head.

1155
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:52,337
Fritz, I really think
you're underestimating Natalia.

1156
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:58,176
What am I doing?

1157
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:00,554
I don't like whisky.

1158
01:41:01,389 --> 01:41:03,265
Look, just tell her.

1159
01:41:03,433 --> 01:41:05,392
No, I can't, I can't.

1160
01:41:06,853 --> 01:41:09,229
What a coward am I.

1161
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:27,497
I know what you're thinking

1162
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:30,333
You wonder why I chose her

1163
01:41:30,501 --> 01:41:35,589
Out of all the ladies in the world

1164
01:41:35,757 --> 01:41:38,550
It's just a first impression

1165
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:41,928
What good's a first impression?

1166
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:48,268
If you knew her like I do

1167
01:41:48,436 --> 01:41:55,442
It would change your point of view

1168
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:09,790
If you could see her through my eyes

1169
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:14,044
You wouldn't wonder at all

1170
01:42:14,212 --> 01:42:18,131
If you could see her through my eyes

1171
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:22,177
I guarantee you would fall
Like I did

1172
01:42:22,345 --> 01:42:26,139
When we're in public together

1173
01:42:26,307 --> 01:42:29,810
I hear society moan

1174
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:34,314
But if they could see her through my eyes

1175
01:42:34,482 --> 01:42:38,401
Maybe they'd leave us alone

1176
01:42:44,492 --> 01:42:48,370
How can I speak of her virtues?

1177
01:42:48,538 --> 01:42:52,249
I don't know where to begin

1178
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:56,336
She's clever, she's smart
She reads music

1179
01:42:56,504 --> 01:43:00,632
She doesn't smoke or drink gin
Like I do

1180
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:04,386
Yet when we're walking together

1181
01:43:04,554 --> 01:43:08,515
They sneer if I'm holding her hand

1182
01:43:08,683 --> 01:43:12,727
But if they could see her through my eyes

1183
01:43:12,895 --> 01:43:17,190
Maybe they'd all understand

1184
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:53,435
Why don't they leave us alone?

1185
01:44:11,913 --> 01:44:18,877
Ladies und gentlemen,
I ask you, is it a crime to fall in love?

1186
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:23,506
Can one ever choose
where the heart leads us?

1187
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:25,258
All we ask is...

1188
01:44:28,304 --> 01:44:29,930
A little understanding.

1189
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:32,557
Why can't the world live...

1190
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:39,773
Live und let live.

1191
01:44:39,941 --> 01:44:43,652
Oh, I understand your objection

1192
01:44:43,819 --> 01:44:47,989
I grant you the problem's not small

1193
01:44:48,157 --> 01:44:51,284
But if you could see her

1194
01:44:51,452 --> 01:44:58,416
Through my eyes

1195
01:44:59,961 --> 01:45:03,755
She wouldn't look Jewish at all

1196
01:45:50,302 --> 01:45:52,012
I'm a Jew.

1197
01:46:51,072 --> 01:46:53,406
Brian, is anything wrong?

1198
01:46:55,618 --> 01:46:57,410
Lazy, that's all.

1199
01:46:57,578 --> 01:46:59,245
That's all?

1200
01:47:00,164 --> 01:47:01,372
That's all.

1201
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:19,015
Oh! Look what I found.

1202
01:47:20,518 --> 01:47:21,851
See?

1203
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:24,813
We must be lucky.

1204
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:39,285
Will you still love me
when I'm blown up like a balloon? Heh.

1205
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:42,163
Will my body drive you wild with desire?

1206
01:47:48,879 --> 01:47:50,797
Of course. Why not?

1207
01:47:56,262 --> 01:47:59,806
Oh, Bri, it's fantastic, isn't it?
Just think:

1208
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:02,517
Your life and my life...

1209
01:48:02,685 --> 01:48:06,521
...solved in one fell swoop,
and all by the baby.

1210
01:48:07,648 --> 01:48:12,485
I guess it's just about the
most significant baby the
world has ever known...

1211
01:48:12,653 --> 01:48:14,654
...since Jesus. Heh.

1212
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:22,662
It'll be a most strange
and extraordinary baby, won't it?

1213
01:50:00,261 --> 01:50:02,262
Good morning, darling.

1214
01:50:08,102 --> 01:50:11,771
Darling, would you mind awfully
seeing if there's a bit of brandy left?

1215
01:50:11,939 --> 01:50:14,565
Put an egg in it
and we'll call it breakfast. Heh.

1216
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:21,322
I suppose you wonder
what on earth happened to me?

1217
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:24,951
I'm afraid we made a night of it.

1218
01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:44,971
Where's your fur coat?

1219
01:50:49,018 --> 01:50:50,727
You did it, didn't you?

1220
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:53,313
Did what, darling?

1221
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:55,315
The abortion.

1222
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:05,241
In God's name...

1223
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:07,994
...why?

1224
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:13,291
One of my whims?

1225
01:51:18,005 --> 01:51:20,590
Is that all you can say?

1226
01:51:20,758 --> 01:51:22,842
"One of my whims"?

1227
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:24,302
What right...?

1228
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:28,264
If you wanna hit me,
why don't you just hit me?

1229
01:51:36,023 --> 01:51:39,233
But you wanted it.

1230
01:51:40,736 --> 01:51:42,070
Didn't you?

1231
01:51:49,203 --> 01:51:51,329
Me and the baby.

1232
01:51:53,332 --> 01:51:56,542
I suppose Max Reinhardt
did show up at the club.

1233
01:51:56,710 --> 01:52:00,171
Or was it a friend of a friend of a friend
of an assistant director...

1234
01:52:00,339 --> 01:52:03,883
...who said he'd try to squeeze you
into the chorus line?

1235
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:06,594
That is, of course, if you....

1236
01:52:07,179 --> 01:52:08,846
If you went to bed with him.

1237
01:52:12,059 --> 01:52:14,394
- You think that?
- Yes.

1238
01:52:18,273 --> 01:52:20,483
Well, then it's just as well, isn't it?

1239
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:23,236
For you, for everyone.

1240
01:52:24,405 --> 01:52:29,158
Now, darling, would you be an angel
and just let me get some sleep?

1241
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:41,212
Tell me why you did it.

1242
01:52:45,384 --> 01:52:48,678
What is there to say?
You've said it all in one way or another.

1243
01:52:49,388 --> 01:52:52,390
Sally, please.

1244
01:52:52,558 --> 01:52:53,933
I have to know.

1245
01:52:57,271 --> 01:52:58,688
Okay.

1246
01:53:02,943 --> 01:53:07,196
I'm self-centred, inconsiderate...

1247
01:53:07,781 --> 01:53:09,449
...and what was the third adjective?

1248
01:53:10,033 --> 01:53:11,242
Oh, yes.

1249
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:14,454
And l have this infantile fantasy...

1250
01:53:14,621 --> 01:53:19,333
...that one day
I'll amount to something as an actress.

1251
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:22,753
Oh, Bri.

1252
01:53:23,297 --> 01:53:26,299
A dinky little cottage in Cambridge?

1253
01:53:27,509 --> 01:53:31,596
A playpen in the bedroom,
diapers on the towel rack.

1254
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:37,143
How soon would it be
before we started hating each other?

1255
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:40,855
How soon would it be before
l started dashing out...

1256
01:53:41,023 --> 01:53:45,193
...and disgracing myself
at some nearest pub?

1257
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,987
How soon would it be before...?

1258
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:54,160
Before?

1259
01:53:57,039 --> 01:53:58,331
Say it.

1260
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:01,125
Go on.

1261
01:54:01,293 --> 01:54:02,835
You might as well now.

1262
01:54:03,003 --> 01:54:04,670
Forget it.

1263
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:06,631
Just forget it.

1264
01:54:10,177 --> 01:54:11,636
I see.

1265
01:54:18,435 --> 01:54:20,770
Bri... Brian.

1266
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:24,148
I really do love you.

1267
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:28,444
Yes. Yes, I think....

1268
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:31,948
I think you do love me.

1269
01:54:40,541 --> 01:54:41,749
You all right?

1270
01:54:46,213 --> 01:54:48,339
Is there anything I can...

1271
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:51,092
...do for you?

1272
01:54:55,639 --> 01:54:59,183
I just think I'll sleep a little while.

1273
01:55:19,246 --> 01:55:21,080
Oh, shit.

1274
01:55:23,792 --> 01:55:25,334
Magazines?

1275
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:27,003
No.

1276
01:55:27,588 --> 01:55:30,214
- It's a long trip.
- Yes.

1277
01:55:33,427 --> 01:55:34,969
Chocolate?

1278
01:55:35,929 --> 01:55:37,346
No.

1279
01:55:45,105 --> 01:55:48,524
- Well, we seem to be here.
- Yeah.

1280
01:55:49,776 --> 01:55:52,028
I'd love to come down
on the platform with you...

1281
01:55:52,195 --> 01:55:54,530
...and wave a tiny white handkerchief,
etcetera...

1282
01:55:54,698 --> 01:55:56,198
...but there is that interview.

1283
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:58,242
It may not amount to anything...

1284
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:01,120
...but you never know. Ha, ha, ha.
- You never know.

1285
01:56:19,014 --> 01:56:20,640
Shocking.

1286
01:56:28,565 --> 01:56:30,107
I'll see you.

1287
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:48,167
Ladies und gentlemen...

1288
01:56:48,335 --> 01:56:52,088
...I give you that international
sensation...

1289
01:56:52,255 --> 01:56:55,966
...Fräulein Sally Bowles.

1290
01:57:07,854 --> 01:57:11,982
What good is sitting alone in your room?

1291
01:57:12,150 --> 01:57:16,404
Come hear the music play

1292
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:20,908
Life is a cabaret, old chum

1293
01:57:21,076 --> 01:57:24,453
Come to the cabaret

1294
01:57:25,539 --> 01:57:29,417
Put down the knitting
The book and the broom

1295
01:57:29,584 --> 01:57:33,879
It's time for a holiday

1296
01:57:34,047 --> 01:57:38,676
Life is a cabaret, old chum

1297
01:57:38,844 --> 01:57:42,221
Come to the cabaret

1298
01:57:42,389 --> 01:57:44,515
Come taste the wine

1299
01:57:44,683 --> 01:57:46,851
Come hear the band

1300
01:57:47,018 --> 01:57:50,020
Come blow your horn
Start celebrating

1301
01:57:50,188 --> 01:57:52,231
Right this way
Your table's waiting

1302
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:56,402
What good's permitting
Some prophet of doom

1303
01:57:56,570 --> 01:58:00,990
To wipe every smile away?

1304
01:58:01,158 --> 01:58:05,077
Life is a cabaret, old chum

1305
01:58:05,245 --> 01:58:09,874
So come to the cabaret

1306
01:58:11,835 --> 01:58:15,588
I used to have this girlfriend
Known as Elsie

1307
01:58:16,256 --> 01:58:20,551
With whom I shared
Four sordid rooms in Chelsea

1308
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:24,930
She wasn't what you'd call
A blushing flower

1309
01:58:25,098 --> 01:58:29,560
As a matter of fact
She rented by the hour

1310
01:58:29,728 --> 01:58:33,981
The day she died
The neighbours came to snicker

1311
01:58:34,149 --> 01:58:38,319
Well, that's what comes
From too much pills and liquor

1312
01:58:39,154 --> 01:58:45,159
But when I saw her
Laid out like a queen

1313
01:58:45,952 --> 01:58:51,957
She was the happiest corpse
I'd ever seen

1314
01:58:52,626 --> 01:58:55,461
I think of Elsie to this very day

1315
01:58:57,130 --> 01:59:03,969
I remember how
She'd turn to me and say

1316
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:10,976
What good is sitting
All alone in your room?

1317
01:59:11,144 --> 01:59:17,274
Come hear the music play

1318
01:59:18,652 --> 01:59:24,907
Life is a cabaret, old chum

1319
01:59:25,992 --> 01:59:31,330
Come to the cabaret

1320
01:59:31,498 --> 01:59:36,293
And as for me

1321
01:59:36,461 --> 01:59:41,882
I made my mind up
Back in Chelsea

1322
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:46,595
When I go

1323
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:53,018
I'm going like Elsie

1324
01:59:53,186 --> 01:59:56,856
Start by admitting

1325
01:59:57,023 --> 02:00:00,651
From cradle to tomb

1326
02:00:00,819 --> 02:00:06,031
It isn't that long a stay

1327
02:00:06,199 --> 02:00:10,119
Life is a cabaret, old chum

1328
02:00:10,287 --> 02:00:14,248
It's only a cabaret, old chum

1329
02:00:14,416 --> 02:00:23,215
And I love a cabaret

1330
02:00:29,347 --> 02:00:30,890
Ladies and gentlemen.

1331
02:00:31,641 --> 02:00:34,518
Where are your troubles now?

1332
02:00:35,228 --> 02:00:38,272
Forgotten? I told you so.

1333
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:40,566
We have no troubles here.

1334
02:00:40,734 --> 02:00:42,401
Here, life is beautiful.

1335
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:46,363
The girls are beautiful.

1336
02:00:47,115 --> 02:00:51,201
Even the orchestra is beautiful.

1337
02:01:35,956 --> 02:01:38,791
Auf wiedersehen
