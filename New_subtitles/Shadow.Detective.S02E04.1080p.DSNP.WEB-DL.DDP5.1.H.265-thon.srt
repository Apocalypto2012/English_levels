1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,710
6 MONTHS AGO

2
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,520
Within less than a month,
three police officers have died,

3
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,570
and one was put in prison.

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,860
On top of that,
the man known to be behind all this

5
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,410
died before he could be investigated.

6
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,780
It must have been murder
disguised as suicide.

7
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,000
So you are as sharp as they say.

8
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,790
Who is this?

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,340
The only one who's made it out alive
from all this chaos.

10
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,510
In three months,

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,220
you'll be assigned team leader
to Geumo's Women and Juvenile Affairs.

12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,640
It's up to you to uncover the truth.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,150
Use any means necessary.

14
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,110
Your starting point...

15
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,030
is him.

16
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,870
But why me?

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,790
I'm not part of the inspection department.

18
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:57,070
SHADOW DETECTIVE SEASON 2

19
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,070
Heavy traffic is expected
on Youngseo Boulevard

20
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,700
in both directions.
That's all for the traffic report.

21
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,290
Mr. Seo Gwangsu,
former Chief of Geumo Police Station

22
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,170
who was arrested for accepting bribes

23
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,630
has been released this morning
on probation.

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
He's out!

25
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,010
You were granted probation today.
Are you satisfied with the ruling?

26
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,510
NEWS Do you have any comments

27
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,890
on the deaths of your colleagues
involved in the corruption?

28
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,470
I cannot apologize enough to you all.

29
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,020
In accordance with the ruling,

30
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,270
I will repent for my crimes
and reflect on them deeply.

31
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,980
From now on, I will serve the community

32
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,190
without pursuing any self-interest.

33
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,150
Do you really not know
about the slush fund?

34
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,690
I have no idea.

35
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,660
Please refrain
from making baseless accusations.

36
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,780
-Thank you.
-Wait.

37
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,780
-Please tell us more.
-What are your plans now?

38
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,580
COURT

39
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,290
The court explained they took into account

40
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,580
the fact that Mr. Seo voluntarily appeared
and turned himself in back in 2022,

41
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,500
the fact that he is deeply
regretting his crime,

42
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,840
and his history of contributing
to the local community.

43
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,800
-Most major roads in Geumo City...
-This is the last one.

44
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,180
-...are experiencing traffic jams.
-Restock on time, kid.

45
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,300
And special attention is required

46
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,720
-on Geumo Inner Beltway
-You eat these every day, that's why.

47
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,350
since there was an accident.

48
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,770
NEW With the ninth
local elections just five days ahead,

49
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,440
in an election poll for governor
of Youngseo Province,

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,940
Future Freedom party candidate
Lee Youngho's approval rating

51
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,700
dropped by 3.5 percent
compared to last week.

52
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,990
As a result, the gap
between the approval ratings

53
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,580
of candidate Lee Youngho and candidate
Kim Jinsun of Upright Country Party

54
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,120
is now within the margin of error.

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,660
Candidate Lee's election camp
has announced

56
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,290
that Candidate Lee was not involved
in the illegal real estate dealings

57
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,670
of Bank President Kang,
who is a close associate of his.

58
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,460
Nevertheless, it seems
this has affected his approval ratings.

59
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,670
With the election just around the corner,

60
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,470
public attention is focused
on how the scandal

61
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,390
involving Candidate Lee's associates
will affect the election from now on.

62
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,720
-Thank you for your hard work.
-I'm rooting for you.

63
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,980
Thank you. I'm Lee Youngho,
Candidate No. 1.

64
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,310
-Thank you.
-Yes. Take care.

65
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,530
He's out on probation,
just as you planned.

66
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,360
FUTURE FREEDOM PARTY
CANDIDATE NO. 1

67
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,880
-You're here. Hello.
-Hey.

68
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,260
PHOTO

69
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,610
Room for just one person.

70
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,530
That's all I need.

71
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,870
So that one person was Seo Gwangsu.

72
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,970
Please give my thanks to Assemblyman Lee
for putting in the work for my release.

73
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,970
It wasn't a big deal.

74
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,770
My uncle is practically
the President of Youngseo.

75
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,110
Then, I guess that makes you
the Prime Minister, Director Yong.

76
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,940
Apologies.

77
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,320
Don't push it, Team Leader Han.

78
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,860
Sorry.

79
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,950
Show him what's inside.

80
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,750
Prime Minister is a bit too much, so...

81
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,710
"Minister"?

82
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,930
Yes, it's perfect. Minister Yong.

83
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,140
Minister Yong.

84
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,430
That's just what my uncle needs.

85
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,680
And this is but a small fraction.

86
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,310
Really?

87
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,690
Director Yong.

88
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,400
I want to get back on my feet again.

89
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,360
If Assemblyman Lee paves the way for me,

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,150
I promise I will pay him tenfold.

91
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,000
NOEUL GOSIWON

92
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,550
Detective Kim!

93
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,920
You might not make it on time today.

94
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,300
Maybe if I step on it...

95
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,350
-What brings you here?
-I'm driving you to work.

96
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,810
-Why?
-Carpooling.

97
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,230
Don't you know it saves gas
and is good for the environment?

98
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,620
Did you send your congratulations
to Mr. Seo Gwangsu?

99
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,660
The two of you are close.

100
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,250
He's busy.
There's no need for me to bother him.

101
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,840
Because his top priority
is sending his thanks

102
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,300
to Assemblyman Lee Youngho
through Yong Hwanju?

103
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,600
Are you late to work
because you were looking into that?

104
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,970
When it comes to my priorities,

105
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,850
the inspection department comes first.

106
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,810
Speaking of which,
let me ask you something.

107
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,190
What is it that they want to know?

108
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,950
If I were to guess, the same thing as you.

109
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,530
First,

110
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,990
we're going to uncover the full account
of everything that happened last year.

111
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,000
And then,

112
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,620
we'll find the one
behind Chief Kook and Team Leader Han.

113
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,380
The one that manipulated the police
and took advantage of us.

114
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,500
We're going to get rid
of the root of the problem.

115
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,090
How ambitious.

116
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,800
It's going to take a while.

117
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,890
If you and I work together,

118
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,480
we might be able to save some time.

119
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,860
Wouldn't your next opponent after
Team Leader Han be a bit too much for you?

120
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,520
Who's the next guy?

121
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,950
What if I refuse to work with you?

122
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,820
Then we'll go after you before them.

123
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,790
For concealing Seo Gwangsu's slush fund
and Team Leader Han's crimes.

124
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,660
Then my plans get revealed,

125
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,420
and the people you're after
will go into hiding.

126
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,420
I don't know about that...

127
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,270
Perhaps, I'll use you as bait

128
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,610
and infiltrate them myself
going undercover.

129
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,820
That's bold.

130
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,540
Think about it.

131
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,370
I'll be in the driver's seat,
and you in the passenger's seat.

132
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,540
I think it's a good partnership.

133
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,760
GEUMO POLICE STATION

134
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,050
Come on, give it a rest.

135
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,010
What?

136
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,470
You're not the only one
who can solve this case.

137
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,890
You're free to leave
if you aren't going to be of any help.

138
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,680
Sir.

139
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,520
-Seokhoon, come here.
-Yes, ma'am.

140
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,560
This is the timing device
found at the scene, right?

141
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,360
-Did you find where it was purchased?
-This can't be bought online.

142
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,730
Detective Son checked tool shops and...

143
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,360
I looked at all the tool shops in Geumo,
but none of them had it.

144
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,610
Look, Gyeongchan.

145
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,120
If it's not found in Geumo,
search the rest of the country.

146
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,700
I'm working on it.

147
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,200
You're not the only one
who knows how to do it.

148
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,580
Hey.

149
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,170
-Hello.
-Hi.

150
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,340
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

151
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,470
PROFILE

152
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,970
Hey, what are you doing?

153
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,260
Excuse me?

154
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,140
Why are you looking into this case,
you little brat?

155
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,680
-Sir, I'm just...
-Hey.

156
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,310
Don't you know victims aren't allowed
to investigate their own cases?

157
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,320
Don't you?

158
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,150
I'm not the victim.
I'm the detective in charge of...

159
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,450
What do you think you're doing?

160
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,950
Now that you mention it,
you never reported to me

161
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,660
when you were digging into Woo Jangik.

162
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,370
You got into this mess

163
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,580
because you ran amok

164
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,120
-without my orders...
-Ran amok?

165
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,830
-What? Did you just yell at me?
-Sir, please.

166
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,540
-I ran amok?
-Are you picking a fight with me?

167
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,210
-Am I running amok? Move!
-Hey, let me go!

168
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,550
Let go. You heard him!

169
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,340
What's wrong with you?
You're making a scene.

170
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,340
-Stand up straight, you punk!
-Sir, let's stop.

171
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,300
You fucking idiot.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

172
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,350
I'm sorry, sir.

173
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,730
Will you come to your senses?

174
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,360
Will you look at that darn brat?

175
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,530
Thank you for the food!

176
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,780
CANDIDATE NO. 1
LEE YOUNGHO

177
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,490
In today's
In-depth Exploration of Current Affairs,

178
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,660
we have Director Choi Dohyung,
who recently retired from the police

179
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,250
and founded a welfare foundation.

180
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,790
Hello, Director Choi.

181
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,590
Yes, hello.

182
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,630
Choi Dohyung is doing a lot
of good work even after retirement.

183
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,220
That's why he's so popular, I guess.

184
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,260
He would've been elected
if he ran for office this time.

185
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,270
-Those children may seem out of control...
-Tell me about it.

186
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,940
-I'll be back sometime.
-Come back again. Thank you.

187
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,320
It needs a lot of attention and support.

188
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,860
You said it needs a lot of attention.

189
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,780
Have you ever thought about
just doing that yourself, Director Choi?

190
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,490
Excuse me?

191
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,240
With the local election coming up,

192
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,080
you've been named the most preferred
candidate for Governor of Youngseo

193
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,750
in a pre-election poll.

194
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,040
Although, of course,
you're not running for office.

195
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,790
That's...

196
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,630
We are aware that there is public opinion
that they wish to vote for you

197
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,720
in the National Assembly
by-election next year.

198
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,800
Do you really not have
any plans on trying?

199
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,190
I'm not sure.

200
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,810
I appreciate the citizens' support,

201
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,440
but I am still lacking in many ways.

202
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,030
Tell Chief Prosecutor Won
to come by the Geumo House tonight.

203
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,530
Yes, sir.

204
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,110
All right. Help yourselves.

205
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,950
Who's next?

206
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,700
Here we go.

207
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,380
Hana.

208
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,540
You got yours earlier.

209
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,970
Are you getting this for Doyoon?

210
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,850
Doyoon didn't come home
last night, did he?

211
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,510
No.

212
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,600
But he went to see his grandmother,
so he'll be back soon.

213
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,520
It's true.

214
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,810
-Look...
-Hey, what's all this?

215
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,730
Hello.

216
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,650
You actually came.
I thought you weren't coming.

217
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,740
You said you would cut ties if I didn't.

218
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,820
I was looking forward to doing that.

219
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,950
Get yourself a plate. They're over there.

220
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,620
They're grilled to perfection.

221
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,830
What's with the barbecue?

222
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,040
A VIP patron of our foundation
sent over some meat.

223
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,130
You're here.

224
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,220
Yes, I invited her.

225
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,140
She should be eating well
to get better soon.

226
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,060
The two of you can talk. I'll go see Hana.

227
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,040
Uncle, I met the guy.

228
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,420
It turns out
getting out wasn't all he had in mind.

229
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,210
He's desperate to go back
to his former glory.

230
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,260
I only did it
to cover for President Kang's vacancy.

231
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,680
Don't think about
bringing him in any closer.

232
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,930
You got him out of there,

233
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,390
so you might as well
get your money's worth.

234
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,940
The resort complex that you promised
in your campaign.

235
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,150
What if we get him to invest in that?

236
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,610
What do you think, Mr. Cha?

237
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,410
How would he know?
He's never even met him.

238
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,500
He's not one to live
under the shadows of others.

239
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,080
It seems strange that
he's groveling to work under you.

240
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,090
You should be prudent.

241
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,300
What the hell do you know on the matter?

242
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,340
Go on home.

243
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,050
Tell him I appreciate the gift.

244
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,720
You're not going to
set a date to meet him?

245
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,430
What's the rush? Take it slow.

246
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,200
Okay.

247
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,460
Sir.

248
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,630
We were the ones who sacked Seo Gwangsu.

249
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,300
Yesterday's enemy can be today's ally.

250
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,470
If we need him, we'll use him.
If we don't, we'll throw him away.

251
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,640
That's how things work in this country.

252
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,110
Still, if he approached Director Yong
with an ulterior motive...

253
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,070
I'm the one who cut off his arms.

254
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,530
If he's up to something again,
I'll end him, then and there.

255
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,380
-Is Chief Prosecutor Won not here yet?
-He just left the prosecutor's office.

256
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,060
You don't have to go to school,

257
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,810
but you have to take the GED, okay?

258
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,060
All right.

259
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,520
-You promise?
-Yes.

260
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,520
Go on ahead.

261
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,490
Oh, right.

262
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,240
What happened to that lady?

263
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,450
Who?

264
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,660
This pork. Jinseok sent them.

265
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,250
He told me to invite you over,
saying you liked pork belly with soju.

266
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,010
He remembers everything.

267
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,640
I feel bad for Jinseok.

268
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,600
He still thinks you resent him.

269
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,060
When the one you really resent is me.

270
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,780
It's all in the past.

271
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,990
It doesn't mean you forgot, does it?

272
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,580
Aren't you the same?

273
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,340
That's the reason you made the foundation.

274
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,630
That's right.

275
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,300
Watching the kids reassures me.

276
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,350
It makes me believe
that I'm doing something

277
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,060
to really protect these kids.

278
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,650
You should just retire early
and help me out.

279
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,450
I'll make sure you can make a living.

280
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,280
Not yet.

281
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,160
I still have things to do.

282
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,790
One thing's for sure.

283
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,590
Neither you nor I
am destined to live comfortably.

284
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,920
You're right.

285
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,760
Well, I saw the news.
It seems like you're going to be busy.

286
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,470
You mean politics?

287
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,810
Are you thinking about running?

288
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,560
Honestly, I'm seriously considering it.

289
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,110
To achieve what I want,

290
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,730
I need power.

291
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,830
Let's drink.

292
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,040
Here.

293
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,130
YOUNGSEO WELFARE FOUNDATION

294
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,750
-Did you look into it?
-Yes.

295
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,550
Team Leader Yeon was on a business trip
to attend a seminar in Seoul.

296
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,260
What time did the seminar end?

297
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,380
At 6:00 p.m.

298
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,760
At 6:00...

299
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,390
The time Hana saw the black hoodie
was around half past 11 p.m.

300
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,930
She had enough time in-between.

301
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,810
But you said
Hana didn't even see the face.

302
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,400
And why would she do
something like that in the first place?

303
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,310
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

304
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,780
The theft case you've been investigating.

305
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,280
None of them had a safe robbed, right?

306
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,240
Hana wouldn't have lied
about something like that.

307
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,290
I think this needs to be looked into.

308
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,560
Kim Jinsun is visiting
Choi Dohyung's foundation tomorrow?

309
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,060
Yes.

310
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,440
It looks like she'll try recruiting him.

311
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,110
All right.

312
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,940
You can leave us, Mr. Cha.

313
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,160
What are you waiting for?

314
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,280
Still, shouldn't you meet again
with Director Choi...

315
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,540
I told you to leave.

316
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,500
Yes, sir.

317
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,640
Let me fill your glass.

318
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,440
Find out how Seo Gwangsu
approached Yong Hwanju.

319
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,610
Yes, sir.

320
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,460
How's life as the chief prosecutor
treating you?

321
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:27,010
I'm just following along the path
that you carved out, sir.

322
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,680
Right, you should be following
along diligently.

323
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,890
Of course.

324
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,260
You'll have to join
the National Assembly next year.

325
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,680
-Excuse me?
-Why are you so surprised?

326
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,400
You've already met Chairman Hwang.

327
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,570
And it'll be easy to get nominated
if we coax a few prominent assemblymen.

328
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,150
I'm thankful, but...

329
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,450
it feels like you have
a huge task for me in mind.

330
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,160
It's not much.

331
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,420
Does it have something to do
with Director Choi Dohyung?

332
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,360
I'm going to go check on the kids.

333
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,240
Have a seat.

334
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,500
How are you feeling?

335
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,630
Is that all you're worried about?

336
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,380
You knew about Woo Jangik
even before this case, didn't you?

337
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,300
What on earth are you hiding?

338
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,430
I'm not hiding anything.

339
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,100
Is Yeon Juhyun the arsonist?

340
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,600
-What are you talking about?
-Hana told me.

341
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,360
And how she told you about it.

342
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,110
It's not Team Leader Yeon.

343
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,780
You already knew who the real culprit was.

344
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,660
-Stop.
-I understand you're trying to protect me,

345
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,370
but what would you do if you were me?

346
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,950
-Lee Seonga!
-Go on, tell me!

347
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,910
Why are you... Hey!

348
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,170
Drop it.

349
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,190
GEUMO POLICE STATION

350
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,700
Hey.

351
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,320
What are you doing?

352
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,780
You're here.

353
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,210
The arson murder case was transferred
to Homicide Team 3.

354
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,170
-On whose order?
-Team Leader Han...

355
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,960
He's trading it
for the Songan-ri murder case...

356
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,510
-You got the cast-off.
-Hey, did you know about this?

357
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,100
-About what?
-Did you know they took our case?

358
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,140
I'm the one who suggested it.

359
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,520
-We can't take on the case because of you.
-What?

360
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,850
Hey, I'll bring these over.

361
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,860
Jeez.

362
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,400
What happened to the arson case?

363
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,490
Do you have a suspect?

364
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,200
The investigation's on,
so we'll have someone.

365
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,320
I'm working on it.

366
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,490
You're not the only one
who knows how to do it.

367
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,290
Come with me for a second.

368
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,540
Tell me about the tool shops.

369
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,310
BAEK SEONGIL

370
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,230
You asked to see me.
Why aren't you saying anything?

371
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,810
I see you're impatient as ever.

372
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,610
You can't even enjoy your tea.

373
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,490
It's not anything special
to discuss, but...

374
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,660
A lot has happened to you as of late.

375
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,370
A junior of yours has been injured,

376
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,330
and a close acquaintance of yours
was suspected of a crime.

377
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,660
I wanted to know how you were holding up.

378
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,540
I'm good.

379
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:38,170
You took a leave of absence for a year
and a half due to a panic disorder.

380
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,090
That's not something
you recover from so easily, is it?

381
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,930
Yes, come in.

382
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,520
Chief, there's something
I have to talk to you about.

383
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,190
All right. If you're done,
I'll get going...

384
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
Sure.

385
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,330
I heard former Chief Seo Gwangsu
was released yesterday.

386
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,830
Have you reached out to him?

387
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,790
No.

388
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,130
To tell you the truth,

389
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,130
I'm not very happy about it
as the current chief.

390
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,090
I'm working hard to reform the image
of the Geumo police.

391
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,840
And if the former chief,
with his corruption scandal,

392
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,430
were to get involved with someone here,
it would be a huge problem.

393
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,270
You don't have to worry about that.

394
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,730
I mean, he and I aren't so chummy.

395
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,820
-I'll be on my way.
-Sure.

396
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,410
Team Leader Han, take a seat.

397
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,290
-How old are you?
-Fifteen.

398
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,630
Are you all around the same age?

399
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,460
You all look similar somewhat.

400
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,920
-The weather has gotten cold, hasn't it?
-Yes.

401
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,800
Make sure to eat well. I'll see you again.

402
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,550
-Take care, everyone.
-Okay.

403
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,850
-Stay healthy.
-Okay.

404
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,350
CANDIDATE NO. 2
UPRIGHT COUNTRY PARTY, KIM JINSUN

405
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,390
Okay.

406
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,530
How do you think
your visit today will help?

407
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,200
What are your plans?

408
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,280
The kids look like
they'd need winter jackets.

409
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,960
I'll take it as payment for the photo op.

410
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,710
The kids here have the brightest faces
among the facilities that I've been to.

411
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,760
Oh. Don't get me wrong.

412
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,550
I also grew up with nothing,
so I know how terrible poverty is.

413
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,890
That's why I like politics.

414
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,310
There's no other playground like this
for self-made people like yourself and I.

415
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,610
Playground...

416
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,900
Is there a reason I should join you
in that playground?

417
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,120
If you give me your support,
Director Choi,

418
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,540
it's definitely possible to turn around
the tables at the last minute.

419
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,040
You know that
you have that kind of influence.

420
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,010
What do I get...

421
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,010
from doing so?

422
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,270
You didn't move back to Geumo for nothing.

423
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,310
You should have a seat
at the National Assembly.

424
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,690
I will become governor,

425
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,650
and no matter what it takes,

426
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,870
I will bring Youngseo Province
and Geumo City to success!

427
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,410
LEE YOUNGHO

428
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,000
I will make Geumo
the greatest port city in Asia!

429
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,960
Lee Youngho!

430
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,920
When was this?

431
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,460
Right after Seo Gwangsu was released.

432
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,840
...support me until the very end.

433
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,260
I will serve you
even from the lowest places!

434
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,720
A REAL WORKER FOR THE PEOPLE
LEE YOUNGHO

435
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:45,000
It seems that Yong Hwanju
is a bigger simpleton than we thought.

436
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,010
He'll be easy to control.

437
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,010
Do you think you'll be able
to approach Manager Cha?

438
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,680
I still need more time.

439
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,440
FUTURE FREEDOM PARTY
LEE YOUNGHO

440
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,900
APPOINTMENT CEREMONY OF SECURITY SECRETARY
JANG SECURITIES CHAIRMAN JANG SUNGTAE

441
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,450
Lee Youngho's secretary,
Cha Kyungpil,

442
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,700
also known as Secretary Cha.

443
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,200
He's the heavyweight
who manages everything

444
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,160
that happens around Lee Youngho,
whether public or private.

445
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,120
It would be one of his responsibilities
to look into people

446
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,420
who approach Assemblyman Lee.

447
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,590
If you're right,
Secretary Cha must be watching me already.

448
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,930
What should I do?

449
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,600
Team Leader Han called,
asking to be paid for introducing me.

450
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,810
-When?
-Tonight.

451
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,270
He seems to be in urgent need of money.

452
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,400
Chief, there's something
I have to talk to you about.

453
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:52,700
Tonight.

454
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,710
Excuse me.

455
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,050
I'm with Geumo Police.

456
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,630
Come on.
I already gave the police everything.

457
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,970
Why do you cops keep bugging me?

458
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,430
You mean the security footage?

459
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,680
Yes, that's right!

460
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,500
I looked into everything you asked.

461
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,080
There's not much, but take a look
at her high school records.

462
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,750
SCHOOL RECORDS

463
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,210
FATHER'S NAME: YEON SANGHOON

464
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,300
FAMILY DETAILS
FATHER:

465
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:58,300
Will you make me run a background check
on everyone transferred to Geumo?

466
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,810
Do you think I enjoy doing this?

467
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,810
That's what I mean.

468
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,640
Don't you get exhausted living like this?

469
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,480
-She graduated from the police academy?
-Yes.

470
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,110
She's only ever been
in Women and Juveniles.

471
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,860
She's even been appointed
as team leader this time.

472
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,900
FATHER:

473
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,780
But why isn't there any record
about her father?

474
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,360
FATHER'S NAME: YEON SANGHOON

475
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:20,200
She intentionally omitted
her father's information.

476
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,120
Isn't it strange?

477
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,250
She had records of her father
until high school,

478
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,830
but it's not on her personnel record.

479
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,370
Yeon Sanghoon?

480
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,880
Look into Yeon Sanghoon for me.

481
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,260
See you.

482
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,310
LIEUTENANT KIM TAEKROK

483
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,740
Yes?

484
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,650
The Chief ordered us to assemble, Ma'am.

485
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,490
Yes, I'll be there.

486
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:26,930
Have a seat.

487
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,320
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

488
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,410
We received an anonymous tip-off
about an employee in our station

489
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,660
trying to cover up the investigation
on the murder of Woo Jangik.

490
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,170
Along with evidence that there was
a significant monetary transaction

491
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,510
between Woo Jangik and said staff.

492
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,870
I'm sorry, sir.

493
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,500
Quiet down.

494
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:38,300
I cannot allow this kind of corruption
to happen again at Geumo Police Station.

495
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,970
Whoever is involved in this matter
in any way,

496
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,510
I urge you to confess
before it's too late.

497
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,810
This is your last chance.

498
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,370
Things are taking a strange turn.

499
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,450
-Hey.
-I'll send you an address.

500
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,740
Tell Team Leader Han to meet you there.

501
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,490
By ten o'clock.

502
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,780
Yes, all right.

503
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,290
And Yong Hwanju?

504
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,620
I'm on my way to see him.

505
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,160
Hm.

506
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,920
KIM TAEKROK

507
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,010
GRAND MALL, 29, HYOYONG-RO,
SEONJU-EUP, GEUMO

508
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,770
He still used to be a cop,
even if he's not one anymore.

509
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:11,810
Can we really trust him?

510
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:14,100
Why would he have gone to jail
if he was a good cop?

511
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,810
We need to get
as much as we can out of him.

512
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,360
Be sure to get him hooked
when he gets here.

513
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,150
You're about to be the governor's nephew.

514
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,820
Why are you always talking about money?

515
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,070
It's not like I get paid
for being the governor's nephew.

516
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,780
I should invest some money
so that I can get a nice position.

517
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,200
Those university smartasses
have been sucking up to my uncle

518
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,710
trying to take everything for themselves.
Those fucking pricks.

519
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,250
He's here.

520
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,050
I hear you're the new big man in Geumo.

521
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,890
Not at all.

522
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,930
Mr. Son here

523
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,850
is trying to get big in the drug business.

524
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,400
I thought he'd be able
to talk to you about business.

525
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,230
Hm. Drug business?

526
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,030
Don't pretend you don't know.

527
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,780
I know you made some good money
back in the day.

528
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,700
Oh, dear.

529
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,000
I'm not sure
if there are any dealers left in Geumo.

530
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,040
I haven't been able
to make a move for a while,

531
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,550
but I just shipped some over
from abroad recently.

532
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,470
It's doing better than I thought,
so I wanted to expand.

533
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
You're the expert in that area.

534
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,470
So why don't you coach us?

535
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,390
Invest in us and look out for us.

536
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,600
If you do that,
I'll take good care of you for sure.

537
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,910
So how do you bring in
the stuff these days?

538
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,540
It seems a lot has changed since my days.

539
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,880
SEONGA, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO
THAT I CAN'T REACH YOU ALL DAY?

540
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,310
It's me. Is Seonga at her desk?

541
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,070
No. She left to go to the tool shops
early this afternoon,

542
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,360
and she hasn't come back.

543
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,650
All right then.

544
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,990
-Hey, you...
-Careful with the stairs.

545
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,750
You discussed everything
with Gwangsu, right?

546
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,160
-Yeah.
-Take good care of him, okay?

547
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,550
-Bring him home, will you?
-I will. What about you?

548
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,760
I called a driver myself.

549
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,380
Okay. I hope to see you again.

550
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,670
-Sure.
-Good.

551
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,500
What should I do?

552
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,550
Secretary Cha knows that Yong Hwanju,
the junkie, is a liability to Lee Youngho.

553
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,630
If you keep messing with Yong Hwanju,

554
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,220
he'll show up.

555
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,530
I threw a stone at them.

556
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,410
I'll be straightforward.

557
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Why are you trying to get close
to Assemblyman Lee?

558
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,750
Probably the same reason as you.

559
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,170
I want to be close to power
to secure a good position for myself.

560
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,630
Don't be too wary of me.

561
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,970
Who knows?

562
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,100
I might be of huge help to you
and Assemblyman Lee Youngho.

563
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,120
The ripples
will gradually spread out.

564
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,120
How long will it take for
the inspection department to take action?

565
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,500
It will have to be at least 10:00 p.m.

566
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,250
for them to get to Geumo.

567
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,710
Okay.

568
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,920
I'll get Team Leader Han to show up
by then. You take him somewhere safe.

569
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,090
We have to wrap this up within the night.

570
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,010
Or else we might lose
an important witness.

571
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,730
The inspection department is here
on standby.

572
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,570
Is Team Leader Han
supposed to be here by ten?

573
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,940
He is.

574
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,070
You don't think
he caught on to our trap, do you?

575
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:19,070
He was probably out of it all day today.

576
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,160
He has to get money,

577
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,580
and he has to secure a means to survive.

578
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,210
Okay. I'll be in touch when it's over.

579
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,000
Let me ask you something
now that we're working together.

580
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,420
Since when did you know?

581
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,720
-What are you talking about?
-The fact that Team Leader Han...

582
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,270
...is working under Chief Baek.

583
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,320
You want to be transferred?

584
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,190
Yes, there's a vacancy for a section chief
at a provincial police agency.

585
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:00,610
And as you're aware,
Lee Seonga keeps digging into things.

586
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,200
If she catches on, me and you...

587
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,540
-But Team Leader Han.
-Yes?

588
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,960
You're the one who failed
to finish things.

589
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,090
So why should I accommodate your request?

590
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:16,590
SEONGA

591
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,050
Come on.

592
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,390
SON GYEONGCHAN

593
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,740
The one who ordered Team Leader Han

594
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,990
to murder Woo Jangik
is undoubtedly Chief Baek...

595
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:49,120
JOINT INVESTIGATION TEAM FORMED

LEE YOUNGHO AND YG GROUP'S
WINTER PROJECT TO HELP THE ELDERLY

597
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,830
...for the sake of Lee Youngho.

598
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,720
Chief Baek is plotting

599
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,680
to pin everything on Team Leader Han
and get rid of him later.

600
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,430
Team Leader Han probably realized that

601
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,640
and contacted Gwangsu
to scrape up funds for his escape.

602
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,140
And what if Chief Baek found out about it?

603
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,610
We received an anonymous tip-off
about an employee in our station

604
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,940
trying to cover up the investigation
on the murder of Woo Jangik.

605
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,090
If so, Chief Baek will definitely
eliminate Team Leader Han by tonight.

606
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,390
We need to get Team Leader Han away
before Chief Baek makes his move.

607
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,740
There's something
you have to take care of.

608
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,460
SON GYEONGCHAN

609
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,090
Hey, what's up?

610
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,760
I can't get in touch with Seonga.

611
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,340
I think she's after Team Leader Han.

612
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,510
What are you talking about?
They transferred the case.

613
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,640
Well, they did.

614
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,730
But I guess
she's been investigating on her own.

615
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,740
TAEKROK

616
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,240
TAEKROK

617
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,240
TO CHIEF SEO
I'M HERE

618
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,750
THERE MAY BE PEOPLE WATCHING,
COME INSIDE

619
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,630
Darn it.

620
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,620
Your call cannot be connected...

621
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,580
-Hello?
-Lee Seonga is headed over there.

622
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,460
What are you talking about?
Why would Detective Lee...

623
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,000
The target is entering the mall.

624
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:27,550
Han is here. We'll proceed
with the operation as planned.

625
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,770
Shit, why did he pick a place like this?
What the hell...

626
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,450
God damn it...

627
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,040
Hands in the air!

628
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,790
Hold on. What is this? Wait.

629
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,790
Team Leader Han Giyong?
We're from the inspection department.

630
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,710
What is this?

631
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,340
Don't do anything rash.
You'll have to come with us.

632
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,010
What the fuck does the inspection
department want with me anyway?

633
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,510
-What the fuck is this? Let me go.
-Take him.

634
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,720
-Don't make this hard, just cooperate.
-Let go. Cooperate, my foot!

635
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,790
Shit!

636
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,170
Punk!

637
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,340
Get him!

638
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,680
Darn you!

639
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,690
Get him!
