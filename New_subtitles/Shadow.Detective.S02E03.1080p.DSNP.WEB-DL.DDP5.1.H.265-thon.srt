00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,300
NO CALLER ID

2
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,440
Hey, friend.

3
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,860
If you keep digging around,

4
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,110
it will be your turn next.

5
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,410
There was yet another friend.

6
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,250
The body found at one of the construction
sites in the redevelopment area

7
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,590
has been identified as Mr. Jang Sungtae.

8
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,010
The cause of death is a fracture
to the skull caused by a fall...

9
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,010
Kook Jinhan and Chairman Jang are dead.

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,140
But it doesn't mean it's over.

11
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,930
So, why did Chairman Jang kill Kook Jinhan
but let you live?

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,190
Why did they keep me alive?

13
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,100
DEATH HAUNTS GEUMO
ANOTHER FOUND DEAD

14
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,060
CHAIRMAN JANG FOUND DEAD
AT CONSTRUCTION SITE

15
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,940
Are they trying to play another game?

16
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,990
I have to find a way
to survive this cruel game.

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,790
STATUS REPORT OF PERSON ON LEAVE

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,410
KIM TAEKROK

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,370
They could be anywhere.

20
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,460
So, I'll have to be prudent.

21
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,720
I have to investigate them one by one…

22
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,050
until it's truly over.

23
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,220
When I arrested Chairman Jang,

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,850
Assemblyman Lee Youngho
was suspected to be involved.

25
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,810
If Assemblyman Lee Youngho
was behind all this,

26
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,570
that would mean that the massive
corruption within the political

27
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,240
and business circles
are happening right here, in Geumo.

28
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,660
LEE YOUNGHO

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,620
Lee Youngho.

30
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,500
Is this a hint that Kook Jinhan gave me?

31
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,420
Or will this turn out to be another trap?

32
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,130
I need to be thoroughly prepared.

33
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,640
CRIME INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT

34
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,430
Small clues will lead me
to smother them out.

35
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,560
I'll investigate to the end…

36
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,780
and eventually find them.

37
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,200
I will

38
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
catch

39
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,700
them

40
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,830
no matter what.

41
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,260
SHADOW DETECTIVE SEASON 2

42
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,770
What are you doing?
What are you doing here?

43
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,390
What is all this?

44
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,020
Why are you here?

45
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,320
So you've been preparing
all that by yourself?

46
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,830
Why didn't you say anything?

47
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,870
Forget me.
But Seonga should have known, at least.

48
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,290
She has nothing to do with this.

49
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,420
And neither do you.

50
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,130
What will you do about Team Leader Han?

51
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,680
It's not the time to go after him.

52
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,390
Then...

53
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,520
You weren't here today.

54
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,140
You didn't see or hear anything.

55
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,940
Understand?

56
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,200
YOUNGSEO WELFARE FOUNDATION

57
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,540
I guess they're doing well.

58
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,790
A relief, isn't it?

59
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,830
You're here.

60
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,880
Gosh, what time is it?

61
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,300
I'm not late.

62
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,960
I was told to show up before noon.

63
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,090
You said even that was difficult for you.
What's gotten into you today?

64
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,680
Maybe my time on Earth is nearly over.

65
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,260
Gosh, how could you say
something like that in front of my baby...

66
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,310
It sounds like a threat.

67
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,140
When do you go on maternity leave?

68
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,890
There's still some time left.

69
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,560
Please take good care of him
while I'm on leave.

70
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,190
That night.
I saw someone wearing a black hoodie.

71
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,570
That lady did this with her finger.

72
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,660
Please don't fight each other.

73
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,660
I can't make any promises.

74
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,930
Hey.

75
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,970
It's been a while.

76
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,420
Hey.

77
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,670
Did you look into it?

78
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,170
Yes. She worked at the same station
as Kook Jinhan.

79
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,420
But they weren't on the same team.
Nothing overlaps.

80
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,010
They probably
never met at the academy either.

81
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,510
Like I said, there's not much to say.

82
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,550
You think?

83
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,680
But before she was transferred
to Geumo,

84
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,600
she'd been on leave for three months.

85
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,520
On leave?

86
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,100
Did it say why?

87
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,060
That's where it gets iffy.

88
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,150
"Personal development."

89
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,240
It is a voluntary leave of absence
you're legally allowed to have, but...

90
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,950
Yeon Juhyun.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,750
She made preparations before coming here.

92
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,140
CIVIL AFFAIRS

93
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,800
-Yes?
-Hello. This is the hospital.

94
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,800
-Ms. Lee Seonga has woken up.
-Yes. I'll be there right away. Thanks.

YOUNGSEO WELFARE FOUNDATION

96
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,010
Detective Choi Dohyung!

97
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,480
LEE YOUNGHO

98
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,070
It's already been a year
since I turned in my badge.

99
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,230
Right.

100
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,570
You're now the director
of a welfare foundation.

101
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,030
My mistake, Director Choi.

102
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,320
Yesterday at the debate, Candidate Lee
stated that he plans on recruiting you

103
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,160
as a crime prevention special advisor...

104
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,910
About that,

105
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,580
I am still discussing
the details with Director Choi.

106
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,380
All right.

107
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,840
Now, why don't we look around
and see how the kids are doing?

108
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,970
Let's go.

109
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,610
Director Choi, it's a relief
to have you back in Geumo

110
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,400
and doing good deeds.

111
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,280
I'm only doing my job.

112
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,070
When you are elected,

113
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,610
please give our foundation
much-needed help and support.

114
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,370
Of course.

115
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,920
You look, well...

116
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,130
better than I thought.

117
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,840
This isn't exactly Hell, you know.

118
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,430
So why did you want to see me?

119
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,010
Do we have any reason
to be seeing each other?

120
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,220
Detective Han...

121
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,350
It's Team Leader Han.

122
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,020
Sure. Team Leader Han.

123
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
You must be busy,
so I'll get straight to the point.

124
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,520
Okay.

125
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,650
I want to get out of here.

126
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,910
Smile at the camera.

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,330
Give us a big smile.

128
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,910
Make sure everyone's visible, okay?

129
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,290
All right. One, two, three.

130
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,630
Smile a bit more, please.

131
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,090
-Look this way, please.
-We'll take another one.

132
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,590
Let's smile just a little bit more.

133
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,760
Thank you.
We'll wrap things up here today.

134
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,220
Thank you, everyone.

135
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,470
Good luck to you.

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,270
YOUNGSEO WELFARE FOUNDATION

137
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,730
Bye, kids!

138
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,100
CANDIDATE NO.1
LEE YOUNGHO

139
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,030
All right. Everyone inside.

140
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,500
The election is around the corner.

141
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,710
But Choi Dohyung setting up the foundation
is making bigger headlines than me.

142
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,000
Have some patience, please.
It's only temporary.

143
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,550
His image as a star detective
isn't going to last that long.

144
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,140
You can't get discharged tomorrow.

145
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,850
Don't push yourself.

146
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,810
I'm fine. I'm better off at home.

147
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,650
No one's there to watch you.

148
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,110
Should there be?
I'm going home because it's home.

149
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,120
Hey, do you even have time to be here?
What happened to the arson case?

150
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,920
Do you have a suspect?

151
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,380
Why aren't you saying anything?

152
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,050
The investigation's still on,
so we'll have someone.

153
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,800
You just take care of yourself.

154
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,350
-What did Taekrok say?
-What else would he say?

155
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,100
"Is Seonga all right?
What did the doctor say?"

156
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,230
He's just worried about you.

157
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,250
You weren't here today.
You didn't see or hear anything.

158
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,670
Get that in your head
if you want to protect Seonga.

159
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,970
I LOVE YOU CAPITAL

160
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,270
Hey, which one of you is Mr. Kim?

161
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,350
-What?
-What the heck?

162
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,990
Where's Mr. Kim?

163
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,490
BELOVED CUSTOMER,
WE WILL BE YOUR RELIABLE PARTNER

164
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,420
I'm about to ask you some questions,
so you'd better answer honestly.

165
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,170
Yes, sir.

166
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,530
Hello.

167
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,370
Who is it?

168
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,040
Excuse me. Is Mr. Park Sangchul here...

169
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,630
That jerk, Woo Jangik.
It seemed like

170
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,920
he was making some kind
of real estate investment company.

171
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,170
There are a lot of people
who sell their personal seals for money.

172
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,470
If he bought those names and made
burner phones and burner bank accounts,

173
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,050
Woo Jangik would've registered himself
as the CEO and shareholder.

174
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,230
Do you have deals these days?
With the redevelopment suspended?

175
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,770
It's still better than last year.

176
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,610
Because outsiders come in
and get the money flowing.

177
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,270
Outsiders?

178
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,230
Yes.

179
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,690
There's a magnate who's been buying up

180
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,900
all the properties around here
since a few months ago.

181
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,450
Allowed me to take a breather.

182
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,590
WOO JANGIK

183
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,460
Woo Jangik made a shell corporation

184
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,970
and was dealing with real estate
near the redevelopment area.

185
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,600
He would meet Kang Seungmo,
President of Yeongseo Bank,

186
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,020
Won Jaegu, Chief Prosecutor of Youngseo,

187
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,930
and Yong Hwanju, nephew of Lee Youngho.

188
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,980
All close acquaintances of Lee Youngho.

189
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,690
They're on a different level
than Woo Jangik.

190
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,360
He wouldn't have been involved
with them for no special reason.

191
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,030
He could be involved in Woo Jangik's
borrowed-name real estate speculation.

192
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,700
CANDIDATE LEE YOUNGHO'S FIRST CAMPAIGN

193
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,490
The plan must have been

194
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,910
to make a huge profit
once redevelopment was renewed.

195
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,540
Is that why he ordered Team Leader Han

196
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,420
to kill the risk factor, Woo Jangik,
with the election coming up?

197
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,800
If that's the case,
there's no reason for him

198
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,720
to take a risk by getting Yeon Juhyun
to steal the USB drive.

199
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,690
Yeon Juhyun…

200
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,520
doesn't work for them.

201
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,650
If that's the case,
then who on earth is she?

202
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,760
It's on the desk.

203
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,900
This is it? Nothing out of the ordinary?

204
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,360
The diner she went to
was near your apartment.

205
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,530
She was there for about an hour.

206
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,570
It's pretty far from her place.

207
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,420
TABLE OF FOOD

208
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,150
TABLE OF FOOD

209
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,230
Yeon Juhyun's spying on me.

210
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,110
How did you feel back then?

211
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,530
When you found Chairman Jang's body
after he killed himself?

212
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,120
The fact that he's going through a retrial
means that he hasn't been acquitted yet.

213
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,620
Trying to provoke and test me.

214
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,620
It was all because
she was suspicious of me.

215
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,540
…SUSPICIOUS OF ME.

216
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,300
And that suspicion...

217
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,720
is Yeon Juhyun's…

218
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,840
weakness.

219
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,520
He's a former police officer

220
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,480
who's now running
a private detective agency.

221
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,230
And he seems to be constantly
helping Detective Kim Taekrok.

222
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,860
I think we should look into what kind of
information he has when the time is right.

223
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,400
Yes.

224
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,080
We'll have to think about how to use
the data in the flash drive.

225
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,370
Yes, I know.
But they don't have time either.

226
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,540
You have to be careful.

227
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,880
Okay.

228
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,520
TAEKROK

229
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,120
Hana. How did you get here?

230
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,330
The Director brought me.

231
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,580
-Hello.
-Hi.

232
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,160
I'm here to meet
with the hospital's business team.

233
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,710
Hana was worried about you a lot as well.

234
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,420
Are you okay?

235
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,510
Yes, I'm okay.

236
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,230
Then I'll head over to see Doyoon.

237
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,270
All right.

238
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,980
All right then.

239
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,780
I'm glad you're okay.

240
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,910
Being a detective isn't easy, is it?

241
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,080
It's all right.

242
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,420
It's good to see you strong.

243
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,380
I wasn't when I was your age.

244
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,470
I always had my resignation in my pocket.

245
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,130
You did?

246
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,260
I wasn't able to quit because of Taekrok.

247
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,640
He stopped me with all his might.

248
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,850
I can imagine.

249
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,650
He's always the same.

250
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,360
But it feels like he's changed these days.

251
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,820
I thought I knew Taekrok too,

252
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,070
but he feels different somehow.

253
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,450
Why?

254
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,460
Is he hiding things?

255
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,550
He thinks that's the way
to protect his colleagues.

256
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,800
He was like that with Jinseok's case too.

257
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,310
Jinseok?

258
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,520
He never told you about that?

259
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,650
Well...

260
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,400
It's not a pleasant story to tell.

261
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,610
GEUMO POLICE STATION

262
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,370
There isn't anyone around him
that could be identified as the suspect.

263
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,790
And there isn't anyone
who has a grudge against him.

264
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,710
As I've explained so far,

265
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,460
it doesn't seem like
there are any suspects currently,

266
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,880
aside from Yang Gitae.

267
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,800
However,
there's no direct evidence, confession,

268
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,010
or distinct motive
that proves Yang Gitae is the arsonist.

269
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,640
Wait.

270
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,390
You were the one who kept saying
he was the most suspicious so far...

271
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,310
It was because of his arson record.

272
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,850
But after going over the arson case again

273
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,060
which, by the way,
is going through a retrial,

274
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,400
it seemed clearer
that Yang Gitae isn't the culprit.

275
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,070
Chief.

276
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,780
If we investigate him unreasonably
while in our custody,

277
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,740
it may come back at us.

278
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,580
No, sir.

279
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,500
Wouldn't it be okay if you proceed
for now as we look for evidence?

280
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,540
About that,

281
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,380
Team Leader Yeon is right.

282
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,090
It could seem
as if the police are framing him again.

283
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,760
Let Yang Gitae go for now.

284
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,930
Then investigate thoroughly
and find the suspect.

285
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,900
Darn it.

286
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,280
It must have been rough, Mr. Yang.

287
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,750
Mr. Gong Haneul. Is it right
for the police to do this?

288
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,500
-Darn.
-I know.

289
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,880
-You know about my temper, right?
-Yes.

290
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:29,760
GEUMO POLICE WILL CHANGE FOR THE BETTER

291
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,760
You must be glad

292
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,020
to have your close neighbor
have his name cleared.

293
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,190
So who's the real culprit?

294
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,230
What on earth is it
that he wanted to hide?

295
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,570
I'm curious.

296
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,780
Why do you think that?

297
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,700
-What?
-We haven't got a motive yet.

298
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,080
Why do you think
it was done to hide something?

299
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,240
Ah.

300
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,200
He started a fire.

301
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,960
I mean,
if he just wanted to kill Woo Jangik,

302
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,290
he wouldn't have chosen
such an inconvenient method.

303
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,510
That's good reasoning.

304
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,590
Why don't you go tell
Team Leader Han that?

305
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,720
Hey, it's me.

306
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,350
Are you sure?

307
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,230
With that evidence,
he won't be able to get away with it.

308
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,270
What time do you leave?

309
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,900
Really?

310
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,240
Then...

311
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,450
I'll pick it up by ten.

312
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,280
KANG SEUNGMO / PRESIDENT OF YOUNGSEO BANK

313
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,200
Thank you.

314
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,120
WON JAEGU / CHIEF PROSECUTOR
OF YOUNGSEO DISTRICT PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

315
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,620
You're here.

316
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,580
Go inside. He's waiting for you.

317
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
Yes.

318
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,680
It's been a while, Secretary Cha.

319
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,690
YONG HWANJU / DIRECTOR AT YD GROUP
MATERNAL NEPHEW TO ASSEMBLYMAN LEE YOUNGHO

320
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,740
I must say this villa is
more impressive than what I've heard.

321
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,950
The energy from the site
feels very good as well.

322
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,460
You've made it to the National Assembly.

323
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,250
With Geumo as a stepping stone,

324
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,420
you're now on your way
to becoming the governor.

325
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,340
It should be smooth sailing ahead.

326
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,420
The sail should take you straight
from governor to presidential candidate.

327
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,180
Of course.

328
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,300
There's less than a week left
until he's elected.

329
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,520
If only that jerk, Woo Jangik
didn't make trouble,

330
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,430
we'd already be sailing smoothly.

331
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,790
Anyway...

332
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,160
I'm worried that there's too much noise.

333
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,750
-What do you mean?
-I mean,

334
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:55,090
the explosion made quite an impact,
and the press is paying attention...

335
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,380
Couldn't you have gotten him more quietly?

336
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,390
Then,

337
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,060
was there a better way to do it?

338
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,350
You said everything he had
was a ticking time bomb.

339
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,570
Enjoy your food.

340
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,070
Take good care of your master.

341
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,120
Director Yong.

342
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,870
The election is just around the corner.

343
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,040
And there are a lot of eyes.

344
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,260
Please be more cautious with your actions.

345
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,470
Fuck.

346
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,260
What about my actions? Tell me.

347
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,850
Speculation, gambling,
women, alcohol, well...

348
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:29,930
Should I go on?

349
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,730
Have you been snooping around?

350
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,860
That's the problem. I didn't have to.

351
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,900
-Secretary Cha!
-Director Yong.

352
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:43,370
The way you can help the assemblyman
is by staying quiet.

353
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,290
You ought to have figured that out
by yourself.

354
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,620
Hey.

355
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,750
Hey.

356
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,300
Do you feel like you're someone
when you act like this?

357
00:27:59,130 --> 00:27:59,960
You...

358
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,680
are nothing but a dog.

359
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,140
You're beneath us.

360
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:13,230
How long do you think you have
before my uncle puts you down?

361
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,110
Get a fucking grip, man.

362
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Fucking hell.

363
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,720
I'm going home.
Just wrap things up, all right?

364
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,760
-Wrap things up and head home.
-Yes, sir.

365
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,890
Team Leader Han.

366
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,100
Let's go for a drink with Officer Kang.

367
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,730
What's gotten into you, asking to drink?

368
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,820
We haven't thrown him a welcome party,
and you've been working hard.

369
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,360
I'm busy today, though.

370
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,570
So you're not coming back today?

371
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,740
No, I'm not.

372
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,450
All right then. Next time.

373
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,120
Next time.

374
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,790
-Let's drink next time.
-Okay.

375
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,710
Take care.

376
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,050
What are you doing?

377
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,550
Go home.

378
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,140
Yes, sir.

379
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,640
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

380
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:41,650
I was wondering
when I'll be able to meet with him.

381
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,740
No. It's not that I'm getting anxious.

382
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,360
Yes.

383
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,950
Still, there are things
that I've done so far, you know.

384
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,200
No, I didn't mean it that way. Yes.

385
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,370
Okay, then I'll just be waiting.

386
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,330
Yes. All right.

387
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,880
Fucking bastard.

388
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,680
It might not have been exposed,

389
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,260
but there was something going on
between you and Chairman Jang.

390
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,310
You thought I wouldn't know?

391
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,900
Come on.
You've really got the wrong person.

392
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,650
-Are you getting senile?
-Scared, aren't you?

393
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,360
Kook Jinhan's dead
and Chairman Jang's gone.

394
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,370
You've somehow managed to stay alive
by pulling on the right people's strings.

395
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,160
But you're always doing the dirty work
without a reward.

396
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,580
You must be worrying over
when you'll be cut off.

397
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,880
You must be losing sleep over it, right?

398
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,130
If you want to survive,

399
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,430
you can't just hold on to the rope.

400
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,760
You've got to climb it.

401
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,440
DIRECTOR YONG HWANJU

402
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,150
Hello?

403
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,450
Hello, Director Yong.

404
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,910
I'm Team Leader Han Giyong
of Geumo Police's Homicide Team.

405
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,990
Maybe you remember me?

406
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,830
Once while we were golfing, I...

407
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,580
Yes, I remember.

408
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,750
Why are you calling?

409
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,390
You should head to sleep early.
You have a tight schedule tomorrow too.

410
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,760
I should.

411
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,470
Are there any other issues?

412
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,900
What? Is Hwanju causing trouble again?

413
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,030
Why don't you send him abroad, at least
for the remainder of the campaign period?

414
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,590
What are you doing?

415
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,970
I'm getting ready to go home. What else?

416
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,680
Why did you come to work already?
Are you all right?

417
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,100
I'm fine.

418
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,640
You can't be. You're in a cast.

419
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,440
Let's have some coffee.

420
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,520
Okay.

421
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:07,080
EVIDENCE PHOTOS

422
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,740
You're returning
to work tomorrow?

423
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,570
What good is it for me
to stay home?

424
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,660
By the way, what were you doing earlier?

425
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,500
Well, I lost a file, so...

426
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,630
But I thought
you were taking this week off.

427
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,710
What are you going to do with that arm?

428
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,090
I'm going to investigate
the whole arson case from scratch.

429
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,630
Be ready.

430
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,510
LIEUTENANT KIM TAEKROK

431
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,560
Hello?

432
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,310
Let's have dinner.

433
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,260
One more gukbap, please.

434
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,340
Coming right up.

435
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,990
I thought you were after the flash drive.

436
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,880
It's obvious what's inside.
Why would I be curious about that?

437
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,420
For me,

438
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,210
I find this more interesting.

439
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,760
A call made to you
at the same time every day.

440
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,350
I traced the number, and you were right.

441
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,890
The Agency's Inspection Department.

442
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,400
It must be the guy who sent you here.

443
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,400
-What is it you want?
-It's simple.

444
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,570
When they call you today,

445
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,870
tell them you'll expose Kang Seungmo,
the bank president.

446
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,660
And why should I do that?

447
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,670
You're not making some obvious threat

448
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,830
like, "I'll reveal who you are," are you?

449
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,720
Isn't this what you need?

450
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,840
Once the scandal
on the bank president breaks out,

451
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,930
it'll be in your hands.

452
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,980
There must be a reason
you've kept quiet about this until now.

453
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,980
If I bring it to light,
won't that create a setback in your plans?

454
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,940
No, it can't.

455
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,950
You didn't come all this way

456
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,490
to catch a small fry like him either.

457
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,920
It's my treat, so eat up.

458
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,720
Right. Let me make one thing clear.

459
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,850
Don't mess with Seonga to get to me.

460
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,230
If you mess with the people around me
one more time, I won't let it slide.

461
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,580
Do this first.

462
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,790
-Yes, ma'am.
-Finish all of these.

463
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,620
-All of these?
-Yes, all of them.

464
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,290
-Why, you don't want to?
-That's not it.

465
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,210
According to the tip-off
received last night,

466
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,960
it's been revealed that President Kang

467
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,670
has been stealing personal seals
of underprivileged people

468
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,550
such as people with disabilities
and senior citizens living alone

469
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,590
to purchase a large number
of real estate near the redevelopment area

470
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,640
for the past few months.

471
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
As of now,

472
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,720
Youngseo Bank has not released any
official statement about these suspicions.

473
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,100
In response, the police revealed

474
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,430
they are investigating
whether there are...

475
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,600
-Sir! You're here early today.
-Mind your own business, kid.

476
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,020
Meanwhile, according
to police investigation...

477
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,230
All right.

478
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:12,070
...has died from the gas
explosion incident that occurred

479
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,950
in Seonju-eup, Geumo, this past ninth.

480
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,750
Yes, just Bank President Kang Seungmo.

481
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,790
Please trust me on this and do it.

482
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,260
I have a plan.

483
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,510
You won't be disappointed.

484
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:35,930
All right.

485
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,760
We'll do that.

486
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,690
INSPECTOR HAN JONGSEOK

487
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,110
Ms. Yeon.

488
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,290
Hey, Team Leader Yeon.

489
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,460
What are you thinking so hard on?

490
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,540
-Sign this for me.
-Sure.

491
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,720
Did you have
a hard time sleeping last night?

492
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,470
You look tired.

493
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,390
I'm sorry, sir.

494
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,390
I'm looking into where the leak happened.

495
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,480
Still, they haven't found
any direct connection to you,

496
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,940
so there shouldn't be any problem.

497
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,980
Back when I was a prosecutor,

498
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,240
I caught all the punks who thought
that way and put them behind bars.

499
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,820
Being complacent like that

500
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,530
will get you cut off like this.

501
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,340
I understand what you mean, sir.

502
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,160
Why only President Kang Seungmo?

503
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,870
Our deal is over.
Can't you just answer this much?

504
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,390
-Gosh. Hello, Assemblyman Lee.
-Hello.

505
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,190
Yes. Thank you.

506
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,100
You're handsome.

507
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,020
-Yes, thank you for your hard work.
-Sure.

508
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,730
Yes. I'm candidate number one,
Lee Youngho.

509
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,780
Yes, I will create
a new and improved Youngseo.

510
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,950
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you.

511
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,070
Yes, thank you.

512
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,240
Sir! Please give us a comment
about the suspicion of President Kang's

513
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,370
-borrowed-name transaction.
-That's enough.

514
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,580
There's suspicion that you covered up
Youngseo Bank's illegal loan case...

515
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,620
-Gosh.
-...during your time as a prosecutor.

516
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,000
Is that irrelevant to this case?

517
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,540
-Sir, give us a comment!
-Yes, I understand your suffering.

518
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,460
Thank you. I'm candidate number one.

519
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,170
-Yes.
-I love you.

520
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,090
We love you.

521
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,300
Please vote for candidate number one,
Lee Youngho. It's Lee Youngho!

522
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,550
LEE YOUNGHO

523
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,060
I don't think we'll be able to get
campaign funds from President Kang.

524
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,690
Once the investigation starts,

525
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:57,730
YD Group's finance team is sure to nullify
all the loan plans for business funds.

526
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,110
Just get to the point.
How much of a setback is this?

527
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,370
-What is it?
-Uncle.

528
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,630
Why only President Kang Seungmo?

529
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:25,180
The funder.

530
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:29,100
That's the one thing I want.

531
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,680
Room for just one person.

532
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,060
That's all I need.

533
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,910
Let me know if you need anything.

534
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,120
They say the first snow
is coming early this year.

535
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,580
So why did you want to see me?

536
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,340
All you have to do is take me
to the man at the top.

537
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,840
Then I'll take care of you for sure.
