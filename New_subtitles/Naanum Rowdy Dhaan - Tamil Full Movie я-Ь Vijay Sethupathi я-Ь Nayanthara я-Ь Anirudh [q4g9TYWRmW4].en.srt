1
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,125
Pandi!

2
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,500
I was looking all over for you.
And here you are.

3
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,250
This is not the place to sit. Right?
Get up, now.

4
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,292
When your mummy comes, I'm telling on you!
- Please don't tell her, sis.

5
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,750
Told you so many times not to sit there.

6
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,667
This has become a habit.

7
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:39,917
Get in.

8
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,250
Remove the "hand", you!

9
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:42,042
Shut up.

10
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,375
Is this tea? Or booze?

11
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,458
Put that down.  Get in.

12
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:47,216
- Don't touch me.
 - Move.

13
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,875
I'm Raja, mind you.

14
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,000
Go on.
- Stay locked up, Raja.

15
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,333
A pencil.

16
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:58,625
Whose could this be?

17
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:01,508
- Uncle
- Yes?

18
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:03,510
- Who are you?
- The pencil

19
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,917
This is not a juvenile prison
How did you get in?

20
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:11,375
My mum is a cop here
I sneak in when there's no one

21
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,542
- Your mum is a policewoman?
- Yes

22
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,542
So you'll study to
become a great cop, huh?

23
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm a little confused
about that, Uncle

24
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,958
Uncle, who is greater a cop or rowdy?

25
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,167
Good question

26
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:26,458
I'll tell you a story
In the end, you decide, okay?

27
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:32,667
Once upon a time, there was a cop and a rowdy.

28
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,875
One day, there was a huge fight between them.

29
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:41,500
Mongrels like you shall hide in fear
when they come to a police station.

30
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,417
Not stand here with nose in the air.
Got it?

31
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:46,792
What's funny?

32
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,958
Why do you look so blue?

33
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,250
A cop's blow.
Lost a tooth, did you?

34
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,750
My tooth didn't fall off...

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,500
Chiclet!

36
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,375
So what the thug did was...

37
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,292
When the cop was walking on the road...

38
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,500
In front of everyone, even his daughter,
he bashed up the cop so bad.

39
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,958
Let go.
- When a cop comes out...

40
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,708
...Especially with his little one.

41
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,667
Shouldn't you be more careful?
- Hands off me!

42
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,667
Dad!

43
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:21,917
A rowdy's blow!

44
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,083
That's your real tooth.

45
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,750
Make a wish to tooth fairy.

46
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,042
Hold on to the teeth you have left.

47
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:41,417
So, you know what the angry cop did?

48
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,375
He pulled out a gun and 'BAM', shot the thug.

49
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,667
Did the rowdy die?

50
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:49,792
Not quite!

51
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,083
That flop cop misfired and fled.

52
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,750
Lawmen are like serpents.

53
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,250
Once they coil your leg, they never let go.

54
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,833
But we shall be one step ahead.

55
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:08,917
The next day,
the rowdy sent a big gift to the cop.

56
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:09,750
Sir?

57
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,125
Who is it?

58
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,917
A package for you, sir.

59
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:13,958
Why a gift?

60
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:15,542
Listen up...

61
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,750
He planted a bomb in the gift.

62
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,542
The bomb exploded and the cop's wife died.

63
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,500
The terrified policeman bolted out of the town.

64
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,292
What's happened to him, sir?

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,208
There was a gas explosion at his place.

66
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,542
He's getting transferred to another town.

67
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:43,708
It's tough being a cop
when you're a family man, right?

68
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,583
That too for a sincere police officer like him?

69
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,625
All the best, Ravikumar.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,625
Thank you, sir.

71
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:56,042
Sir, I'm opening up a new liquor store.
You must inaugurate it...

72
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,042
From liquor shops to politics...

73
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,292
He became a big shot in town,
and settled there.

74
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:04,875
You tell me now.

75
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,042
Who won?
The cop or the rowdy?

76
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,125
Rowdy is greater,
but you've been locked up in a cell.

77
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,167
He must be locked away somewhere, too.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,500
Just count to five.

79
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:17,750
1...

80
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,500
2...

81
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,542
3...

82
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:25,583
Yes!

83
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:26,333
4...

84
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,292
We just arrested him,
and you're here already?

85
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:30,917
5.

86
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:32,042
Open!

87
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,375
That's all, my boy.
Take it. Your pencil.

88
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,042
Ta ta. Buhbye.

89
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,458
My own Angel of Justice!
Thank you very much.

90
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,917
I don't want your pen.

91
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,958
Only finger printing.

92
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,292
Yeah.

93
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,917
See you, my boy.

94
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:54,625
I'll be back.
Let's go.

95
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:38,375
Mummy, Kuzhali sister asks me to
sit inside the cell for no reason.

96
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,875
Really?
- Yes, mummy.

97
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,208
Okay. I'll handle it.

98
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,833
Shall we go home?
Get your bag.

99
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:49,583
Careful, son.
- Ma'am. One minute?

100
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,417
Your son always sits inside the cell.

101
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,708
He doesn't talk to any of the cops here.

102
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,542
He only talks to the criminals and crooks.

103
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,625
Normally, cops' children turn into...
- Hold it!

104
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't want to hear your stories.

105
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,708
I know about my son.
He came and told me everything.

106
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,750
Another word about my son...

107
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,708
And I'll personally drag you into the cell
and pummel you.

108
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay Ma'am.
I won't say anything.

109
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:18,667
My son WILL become a cop.

110
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,833
I know how to make it happen.

111
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,000
Bye!

112
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,083
A rowdy is a good person.

113
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,500
A man with a conscience.

114
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,625
One who would even dare to give up his life
for those who believe in him.

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,750
But a cop?
He wouldn't.

116
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:52,250
So you've got an issue.
You take it to a cop and a rowdy.

117
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,792
Or even God.

118
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,667
Who would get down and address the issue?

119
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,500
It's the rowdy, right?

120
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:00,958
Boss.

121
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,625
You know I am right.

122
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:05,625
In most movies,
rowdies are the heroes, right?

123
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,750
So who is the hero?
- It's the rowdy, boss.

124
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:09,000
Correct.

125
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:12,792
Hello?

126
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,250
Brother, a bad policeman is like a rowdy.

127
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,375
A good rowdy is like the police.

128
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,333
I just want to be a good rowdy.

129
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,667
Go on.

130
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:25,292
Arms up.

131
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,792
179. Next...

132
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:29,375
Breathe in.

133
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,125
80.

134
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:31,500
Raise your arms.

135
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:35,000
84.

136
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,417
87, right?

137
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,207
Yes, 87 kg.
- Are you done?

138
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:40,292
Next!

139
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:41,582
Hi mummy!
- Carry on.

140
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,167
What's his weight?
- 87 kgs, Ma'am.

141
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,875
Don't write such a big number.
It will jinx his health.

142
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,875
Weight is the one thing
he has gained on his own.

143
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,292
Reduce it a wee bit.
- What shall I write, Ma'am?

144
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,125
Maybe 60 or 70.

145
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:57,333
Shall I write 70?
- Great. Do that.

146
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,125
70 it is.
- Okay.

147
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,292
Be it fear or respect;
You do feel something.

148
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,667
They make you shiver.

149
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,042
Whereas when you see a cop,
you pretend to respect them.

150
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,667
Rowdies are awesome. Got it?

151
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,125
Hello? Boss!

152
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,375
Run fast and they'll make you a cop.
Then you can't become a rowdy.

153
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:18,625
Slow down a bit.
Or they will make you a cop.

154
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,250
So...

155
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:23,750
What did he clock in the 100 m sprint?

156
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:24,917
Thirty seconds, Ma'am.

157
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,792
That slow?
- Yes, Ma'am.

158
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:30,375
Make it lesser, please.
- You tell me what to write, Ma'am.

159
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,833
Maybe 5. Or 6 seconds?

160
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,833
Ma'am, Usain Bolt's world record is 9 seconds.

161
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:37,292
Oh. Is it?

162
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:39,208
Write that down, then.

163
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,833
9 seconds?
- Yes, good.

164
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,792
How are his vital stats?

165
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,958
Please be mindful.
- I will, Ma'am.

166
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,125
He's a playful boy.

167
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,458
Need to make him a policeman, somehow.
- Okay, Ma'am.

168
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,000
Dude, you're all healed.
Why don't you take that off?

169
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,542
Look at my bandaged face.

170
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,375
Looks pitiable, right?

171
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,750
People who come to hit me
take pity and let me go, dude.

172
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,792
Dude!

173
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:03,958
Our job is all about being macho.

174
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,500
Get rid of it.
- You can fool the world, but not me.

175
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:07,083
Boss!

176
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,167
Boss...

177
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,083
I was listening to everything you said.

178
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,917
I want to become a great rowdy.
Like yourself.

179
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:17,917
I looked like a rowdy to you?

180
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:19,792
Yes, Boss. Aren't you one?

181
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:21,042
You are appointed.

182
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:39,792
Lights off!

183
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,083
Here is ten grand.

184
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,958
Treasury, take it from him.

185
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,208
He should suffer like I'm suffering.
- Hey, stop.

186
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,292
Got WhatsApp on your phone?
- Yes.

187
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,083
You'll receive pictures tomorrow.
- Okay.

188
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,167
Hey, Kada.
- Yes, Pandi?

189
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,667
Collect the details.
- Okay.

190
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,250
Keep it in our safe...
- There's 500 rupees extra in it.

191
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,292
It says 10 grand to break the arm,
15 for the legs...

192
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,542
But 25 grand to talk over the phone?

193
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,208
Dude, show him a sample.

194
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,833
Someone you really hate.
Give their phone number.

195
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,042
9-5-6-6-2-3-1-4-9-4

196
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,958
Mr. Computer, put me on speakers.

197
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:35,917
Hello?

198
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,083
I've got Six tickets for Sixth Sense.
Want to come?

199
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:38,667
What?

200
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,208
Also have three tickets for The Three Musketeers.
Come for that?

201
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:42,292
Who the hell are you?

202
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,417
Cheap biscuit.
If you won't come for the movie, just say so.

203
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,458
Who the...?
I'll tear your face apart...

204
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,208
You're swearing at me?
Try being polite instead.

205
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,042
Don't know who it is.
- Let me talk to him.

206
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,750
Who are you?
What do you want?

207
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,417
I want you. Will you marry me?

208
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:58,083
"How could the Moon rest;
With the sky burning..."

209
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,042
To set this song as your caller tune,
Press 1.

210
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,917
It's some customer care guy.

211
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,000
Press 2.

212
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,875
Press the person sitting next to you.

213
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,500
I'm going to kill you, man.

214
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:13,833
Boss.

215
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,083
I need a favour.
- What?

216
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,417
I'm in love with a girl.
She's a white woman.

217
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,708
Got a photograph?

218
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,125
Show me.
- Here.

219
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,417
We'll get hitched.

220
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:27,375
Boss!

221
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:28,833
I meant, get you hitched.

222
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:34,083
Yes, Mummy?
- Boy...

223
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,583
Mummy has the night patrol duty.

224
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,083
Will you come get the house keys?

225
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,125
Okay, mummy.
I'll be right there.

226
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,083
Okay, dude. Bye.

227
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:43,708
Bye!

228
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,875
I'll go see his girlfriend.

229
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:46,958
Ma'am?
- Yeah?

230
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,250
This girl was standing alone on the road.

231
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:52,000
When I tried to enquire,
our arms accidentally brushed.

232
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,292
She called me a "Brainless oaf", Ma'am!

233
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,875
She was correct.

234
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,500
She even raised her arm!

235
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:00,042
She raised her arm?
- Yes, Ma'am.

236
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:00,958
Bring her to me.

237
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:02,542
You! Come here.

238
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:09,667
Miss, what's your name?

239
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,958
Miss! What is your name?

240
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,542
So arrogant.

241
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,125
Ma'am is talking to you.
Answer her.

242
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,208
What is your name?
I've been asking you.

243
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,292
Kadambari.

244
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:31,167
No, Ma'am.
I was minding my own business.

245
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:35,250
She came and knocked my phone down.
It's broken, see?

246
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,750
So?
Is that any way to talk?

247
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,958
My dad is a policeman, too.

248
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,833
It was her fault.

249
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,042
Who?

250
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,208
What is your father's name?

251
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:48,958
Ravikumar.

252
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,125
Ravikumar?

253
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,750
Your father was posted in Mahe, right?

254
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:58,083
He's retiring in two days?

255
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,083
Yes.
-You've come here for that?

256
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,542
Where is your house?

257
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,917
I'm talking to you.
Where is your house?

258
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,042
Mummy. The key?

259
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:07,167
Here.

260
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,625
Don't drive around on patrol all night.

261
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,250
Park the car in a spot
without mosquitoes and sleep off.

262
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:14,917
Take care, sis.

263
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,167
Boy!
- Yeah?

264
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,167
Don't you know your mummy?

265
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,417
I'll come home and sleep
if I feel sleepy.

266
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,792
Leave the door open.
- Okay.

267
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:22,917
Here, take this.

268
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,792
There are rice cakes and fish curry in this.

269
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,458
Eat it. If there's leftovers,
leave it in the fridge.

270
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,625
Okay.
- Okay, bye.

271
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,708
And mummy, something I wanted to tell you...
- What?

272
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:32,625
Okay, forget it.

273
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,917
Okay. Bye, Mummy.
- Bye, sweetheart.

274
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,958
Saw my son?

275
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,458
Such a gem of a boy.

276
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:44,875
There's a girl standing next to me.
He did not look at her once.

277
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:48,542
You're always criticising him.

278
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:52,875
Someday, I will drag you to the cell
and pummel you.

279
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,833
Keep driving. Go, go, go!

280
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:56,833
Overtake the car.

281
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,167
Can't see a thing from here. Keep going.

282
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,417
I can only see Kuzhali sis. Go on!

283
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:01,667
Stop!

284
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,458
Ride away when I tell you.
Hold this.

285
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,875
Mummy?
- What is it,Pandi?

286
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,292
Isn't Mummy here?
- No.

287
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,083
I had to tell her something.

288
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,042
Go, now.

289
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,917
I told him to wait,
but he left!

290
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,292
I noticed.

291
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,667
I'll sit in the back. Drop me home.
- Okay, Pandi.

292
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,458
Sis!

293
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,125
You're here?

294
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,792
Okay, I'll sit in the back.
Drop me home, okay?

295
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:51,167
Whoa!

296
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,083
Oh boy. What a girl!

297
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,417
Hello? Excuse me.

298
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,125
Who would want to talk to YOU?
Turn around.

299
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:03,958
Hello.

300
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:05,458
Excuse me.

301
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,000
My name is 'Pondy' Pandi.

302
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:09,167
Your name?

303
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,083
Wow, what a ears!

304
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,250
So many piercings.

305
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,250
But it looks great on you.

306
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,750
Are you from around here?

307
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,208
Never seen you before.

308
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,375
How are you so fair?

309
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:20,875
Hullo, Miss White!

310
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:22,167
You speak only Hindi?

311
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,333
"Hum Aapke Hain Kaun".

312
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,750
"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"

313
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,583
So. What's the matter?
Could have come to me.

314
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:27,792
I'm the Don around here.

315
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,417
Why did you go to my mother?
Hello?

316
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,292
I've been talking for so long.
Won't even say hi?

317
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,333
You don't know my clout,
so you're insulting me.

318
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,000
Sir, pull over here. Please.

319
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,167
My house is here.

320
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,083
I'll get dropped.

321
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,875
Go away. Nobody cares anyway.

322
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:47,917
Smile!

323
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,375
Won't you at least say goodbye?

324
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:51,542
Hello!

325
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,417
Look here...

326
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,333
Let's just drive away, brother.

327
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,833
Stop, brother!
I didn't really mean it.

328
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,166
Hello?

329
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,541
Excuse me?
- Ya.

330
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,875
Can I borrow your phone?

331
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,542
I need to make a call.

332
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,458
My phone broke.

333
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,167
Just need to make a call. Please?

334
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,750
I kept talking to you in the car,
and you didn't say a word.

335
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,708
Now you want my phone?

336
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:45,917
No. I cannot!

337
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,708
You spoke to me in the car?

338
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,250
Sorry, I didn't notice.

339
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,833
Why? Why, I say!

340
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,208
Are you blind?
Can't you hear?

341
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,333
I said, can't you hear?

342
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,667
My ears... can't hear.

343
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,875
I was kidding! Here you go.
- No.

344
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,750
Really.

345
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,625
I really can't hear.

346
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,500
Don't tell anyone.

347
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:19,583
Are you serious?

348
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,625
Seriously.

349
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:25,375
But you get what I am saying,
and you reply. How?

350
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:26,833
That...

351
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,500
I can read your lips while you speak.

352
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,125
That's how.

353
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:32,958
You can read my lips?

354
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,000
Let me say something.
Can you repeat it?

355
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,958
Roses are red.

356
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,625
Correct.

357
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,458
That's exactly what I said.

358
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:00,167
Phone?
- Here. Call anyone you want.

359
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:05,417
They'll answer and talk.
Can you say it for me? Please?

360
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,292
Who are you calling so late?

361
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,125
Who are you calling at this hour?

362
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:14,667
Dad.

363
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:16,375
Phew!

364
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,500
Then okay!

365
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,208
Where has he gone?

366
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,792
He went to meet a friend.
He still hasn't returned.

367
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:32,000
So, I am scared.

368
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,875
There is no answer.

369
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,250
He didn't answer?

370
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:42,083
Thanks.

371
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,667
Hey!
I've got an idea.

372
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,917
Maybe he didn't answer because
mine is an unknown number.

373
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,375
Let's insert your SIM card and try?

374
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,208
Brilliant, right? Give it to me.

375
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,667
No words of praise?

376
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:06,833
Did you see that?

377
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,333
Some punk is out at this hour...

378
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,000
Standing on the road and talking to some girl.
- Madam!

379
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:14,750
Calling your own son a punk?

380
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,667
That's your gem of a boy!

381
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I've asked you a million times
and you haven't answered.

382
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:19,875
Hello?

383
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:21,292
What's your name?

384
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:23,083
Kadhambari.

385
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:24,417
Eh?

386
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:25,792
Kadhambari.

387
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,542
Kadhambari?

388
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:30,458
Had this name all along?

389
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,667
What are you doing here?

390
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,375
At this hour, with this girl?
- No, mummy.

391
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:38,542
She wanted my phone, so I helped her.

392
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,958
Don't start imagining things now!

393
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,167
Remember your promise?
- What promise?

394
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,958
That you'll marry the girl I pick for you.

395
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,583
Everyone else is like your sister.

396
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,083
Why bring it up now?

397
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,083
Just wait...
- Boy!

398
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,875
I don't like the way you're shaking your head.

399
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,833
No such thing, Mummy.

400
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:57,250
No.

401
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,667
Call her your sister, now.
- Mummy.

402
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,250
Call her your sister.

403
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,042
Don't, Mummy. Please.

404
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,500
I said, call her your sister.

405
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:15,917
NOW!

406
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,833
Sist - sweetheart!
- Sweetheart?

407
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:25,667
What did you just say?
- I ate a fly!

408
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:27,125
Okay, bye.

409
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:29,917
I said sister and she left.

410
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:30,458
Let's go.

411
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,250
That poor girl is hearing disabled.
- Who is?

412
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,542
Just wanted to help her.
- What are you talking about?

413
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:35,542
Phone...

414
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:41,625
Oh no. Dad will call me.

415
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,208
Oh no...

416
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,958
He has left with my phone.

417
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,458
Wake up!

418
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,292
Hang these to dry. Go.

419
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,958
What did you say
about helping with the girl's phone?

420
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:13,875
Sweetheart, you're the one;
The one I've seeked all my life

421
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:22,708
Darling, someday...
Someday I will make you mine

422
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:31,208
One night, I saw this damsel:
Rowdy turned fully romantic

423
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:36,000
I'll pave a way into your heart;
I will lure you! I will, I will

424
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:40,875
The way you made my jaw drop;
And the way you sent me soaring up

425
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:45,667
Chasing you, I am such a nag;
Won't somebody come hold me back?

426
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:50,583
Your have breathed all this colour;
Into my life that was so grey

427
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:55,292
This rusty old body of mine;
Finds it's nerves set on fire

428
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,542
Oh, that face of hers!

429
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,917
And her shape!

430
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:02,292
Now I am...

431
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,750
You temptress! I'm swooning.

432
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:50,417
Act like I broke your arm.

433
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,625
They just need to believe
they have avenged.

434
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:56,917
Smile brighter, won't you?

435
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,125
Idiot. your arm is broken.
Why would you smile?

436
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,625
Make sure he sees you with the broken arm.

437
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,583
Act like you're in pain.
- Okay.

438
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,458
Don't fold your hand that way
when he's looking.

439
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,583
Tell me. What's on your mind?
- When will I get the phone?

440
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:19,625
You don't look at me;
The way I look at you, girl

441
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,458
I'm saying all these mushy things;
But you can't hear them, girl

442
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:33,750
You're the woman of my dreams;
The apple of my eye, it seems

443
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:38,542
Even when I become a big wig;
You will always be my favourite gig

444
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:43,667
Girl, I want to be yours;
In this lifetime and next

445
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:23,167
There are school children around.
Our bloodshed will scare them.

446
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:24,875
Let's call off the scene.
- Dude.

447
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,333
The scene is for them.

448
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,750
A tiger would rather starve than
graze on fields.

449
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,292
If a tiger is hungry and there's grass,
it should eat it.

450
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:37,417
Eat the grass; Survive.
Then eat the enemy who made it eat grass.

451
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:39,375
Brother, he is the one.

452
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,417
Hired a rowdy to spook me?

453
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,250
What's your name?
- Ramesh.

454
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,083
Your name?
- I told you the other day.

455
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,875
When there's a scene happening,
you gotta answer anyway.

456
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,125
Let's start over.

457
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,458
What's your name?
- Ramesh.

458
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,417
Your name?
-I told you the other day.

459
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,042
Dude.
-Punch your face!

460
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:55,917
Tell me your name, boy.

461
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:56,625
I'm Suresh.

462
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:58,500
How many years into love?

463
00:26:58,792 --> 00:26:59,583
Ten months.

464
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,750
And you?
- Ten months.

465
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:01,458
English, huh?

466
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:03,625
How many gifts have you got her?
- Fifty.

467
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:04,875
You?
- Fifty, brother.

468
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,042
Match is a Draw.

469
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,792
Have you got evidence?
- Yes, I have a selfie with her.

470
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,792
What is your rank?
- Third in my class. So is she.

471
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:19,875
You?

472
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:22,500
Answer me.

473
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:24,042
Answer him, brat.

474
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:25,542
I failed.

475
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:29,125
Good boy.
- Thanks, Brother.

476
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:30,208
You're finished.

477
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:32,167
The girl is yours.

478
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:33,500
But, brother...

479
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:36,500
If a smart boy and a smart girl get together,
you'll get too cocky.

480
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,333
And you'll have fights.
Then break up.

481
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:41,250
But a bad student will adjust
for the smart girl.

482
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,792
Bring a girl who flunked.
I'll bless your alliance.

483
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,917
The scene is now over.
Pay the fees and disperse.

484
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:47,167
Come on.

485
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,417
Does that girl have an older sister?
Or a young aunt?

486
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:51,167
Tell me.

487
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:53,000
What's on your mind?

488
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:54,792
When will I get my phone back?

489
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:59,208
What is your problem?

490
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:01,375
I've handled such big scenes since morning.

491
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,000
You have nothing to say about it?

492
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:04,667
Keeps saying, "Where's my phone? Where's my phone?".

493
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:05,792
Your phone is at the service shop.

494
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,250
Your SIM card is in my phone.

495
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,792
Your dad can call you if he wants to.

496
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:10,250
Why pester me for your phone?

497
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:10,875
No!

498
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,250
I need to speak to my dad.

499
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,375
Your dad has gone to see his friend, right?

500
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:16,792
I'm sure he's safe.
He'll come.

501
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,292
No...
- You're crying for your father like a kid!

502
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:21,167
You see...

503
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:22,417
My dad...

504
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:25,667
Didn't go to see his friend.

505
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,000
Where, then?

506
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:34,250
He went to shoot a man.

507
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:37,917
Yeah...

508
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:40,458
What happened?

509
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:45,875
Thank you, master.

510
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,750
Shall I take my leave?

511
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,458
We'll meet later.

512
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:04,333
This scent of Pondicherry booze!

513
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:07,542
Pull over, Dad. We'll buy some.

514
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,333
No need.
- Why?

515
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,042
Not when I'm in uniform.

516
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,583
I'll go get it, then.

517
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,792
No.

518
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:18,292
Dad, this is Pondicherry.

519
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,125
Brother, two beers.

520
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:22,083
Get two beers.

521
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,042
Is it chilled?

522
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:25,833
Yes, Miss.

523
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:43,083
What's wrong?

524
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:44,417
What is it?

525
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:49,000
I saw him, dad.

526
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:49,833
Who?

527
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,333
It's him.
He's in there.

528
00:29:55,625 --> 00:30:00,208
That face... it's etched in my memory, dad.

529
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,667
He's happy.

530
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,083
What are you thinking, Dad?

531
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,125
We can't do a thing to him.

532
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:15,833
Let's go.

533
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,958
Mom, where is Dad?

534
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,667
Look in his room.

535
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,500
Dad!

536
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:42,875
Dad!

537
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,375
I'm hungry, dad.

538
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:46,958
Dad!
- Kadhambari

539
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,083
Is my little one hungry?
Let's eat.

540
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:52,792
Who is it?

541
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,625
I was asked to deliver this, sir.

542
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:56,167
Who sent you?

543
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:58,375
Our boss.

544
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:00,042
Wait up, boy.
-It's a mixer, dad.

545
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,917
Wait, child. Don't know what it is...

546
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,375
Who could it be?

547
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:10,333
Wait, let daddy do it.
- I'll manage.

548
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:12,875
Sharadha, see what's in it.

549
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:25,875
Hello?

550
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,042
Where is the Inspector..?

551
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,042
Mom!

552
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:32,875
Kadhambari!

553
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,292
It hurts!
My ears hurt, Dad.

554
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,833
Let me see...

555
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,667
Dad, it hurts.

556
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:20,958
Let's go.

557
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:22,708
Don't cry.

558
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:25,333
Come.

559
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,333
All these years in this uniform,
didn't do squat.

560
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,500
They're asking me to retire already.

561
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:47,542
If only I had managed to kill that man,
I would have retired happily.

562
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:10,750
Dad?

563
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:14,625
Dad...

564
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,625
He's calling out to you.

565
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,208
Miss, he's calling...

566
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,000
Why is that girl walking alone
at this hour?

567
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,208
Where is your house?

568
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:39,542
Hey, I'm talking to you.

569
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:41,292
Brainless oaf!

570
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,250
You broke my phone.

571
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:48,000
Raising your arm at a cop?

572
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,875
Come with me.
- Let go!

573
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:53,500
If anything should happen to my dad...

574
00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:56,667
I cannot live with it.

575
00:33:57,542 --> 00:33:58,500
Hello!

576
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,375
What you said wasn't wrong.
Your father is not wrong, either.

577
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:03,708
All this panicking is wrong.

578
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,792
Okay? We'll handle it.

579
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:06,958
Come.

580
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,042
Anwar!

581
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:12,292
Coming, Pandi.

582
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:14,292
Take her upstairs and get her food.

583
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:15,708
Is this place good enough?
- It's fine.

584
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,042
Kadhambari!

585
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:19,792
Wait for five minutes.
I'll finish something and come back.

586
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:22,083
Here, order anything you like.

587
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:25,375
This guy?

588
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:27,875
He's my grandfather.
He falls ill very often.

589
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,292
So I'm always by his side.

590
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:36,500
What is your name?

591
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:37,333
Kamakshi.

592
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,083
What?

593
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,083
Kamakshi.

594
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,667
Kamakshi?
- Yes.

595
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:44,333
What's your problem, dude.

596
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,750
Listen to me.

597
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:49,208
Look, I think her dad's in a situation.

598
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:51,417
Everytime his name comes up,
she gets upset and starts crying.

599
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,333
This is her phone.

600
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,958
Save your number under her dad's contact name.

601
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,708
Hold on!

602
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:55,667
Listen to me.

603
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:05,458
Madam, tell me your order.
What would you like to eat?

604
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:08,000
Madam, I'm talking to you.

605
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:09,708
Hello, Madam!
I'm asking you�

606
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:12,875
Excuse me?
He's calling you. Where's your mind?

607
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,250
Madam, what will you eat?

608
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:18,000
One portion vegetable fried rice.

609
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:19,792
Chef, one fried rice!

610
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,125
My ears are�

611
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:30,583
Slightly�

612
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:39,083
Don't tell anyone else?

613
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:40,875
I won't tell anyone, Miss.

614
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,667
Dude, listen carefully...

615
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:49,417
If that girl calls or texts your number,
let me know.

616
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,708
Do as I say, okay?

617
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,708
We'll get caught.

618
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,875
We won't.
She can't hear her phone ringing.

619
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,292
We'll definitely get caught, dude.
- Dude!

620
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,833
We've secretly done rowdy-ism
in this area for so long.

621
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:00,708
There's a cop right at home
but we've handled so many scenes.

622
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,917
Did we get caught then?
So what if we get caught anyway?

623
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:02,625
We'll handle it.

624
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,833
Why should we handle it?
Are you in love with her?

625
00:36:05,917 --> 00:36:06,458
I don't know.

626
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,042
But as long as she's here,
she has to be happy.

627
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:08,667
You do as I say.

628
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,792
When she asks for her phone,
I'll give it to her.

629
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:10,833
I'm off! Bye.

630
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:28,875
What happened?

631
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:32,292
I knew something was wrong.

632
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,542
My dad has texted.

633
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,167
I don't know what to do.

634
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,792
I'm really scared.

635
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,208
This is a cop related issue.

636
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:47,583
This is a cop related issue.
We need another cop's help.

637
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,167
Shall we ask my mother?

638
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:49,875
No!

639
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,375
No cops, please.

640
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:54,083
Cops don't always help other cops.

641
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:59,042
Or they would have done something
when my house was bombed, right?

642
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,208
Most importantly�

643
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:05,042
My dad is about to retire.

644
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,042
His reputation is at stake.

645
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:11,417
This has to be dealt with in
some other way�

646
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,250
Can you help me?

647
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:25,792
Can you take me to a great rowdy?

648
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:30,875
Someone really terrifying and brave.

649
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,208
Take me to a bold rowdy, please.

650
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:35,792
Okay, tell me.

651
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:40,250
I told you!
Take me to a rowdy.

652
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:47,542
Tell me, how can I help you?

653
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:50,167
Tell me, how can I help you?

654
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:51,500
I told you.

655
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:53,333
Take me to a rowdy.

656
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:04,833
Come with me.

657
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:05,708
LIGHTS ON!

658
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:25,667
Tell me now.
How can I help you?

659
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,417
See, you had asked for a rowdy, right?
I'm a rowdy.

660
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:33,000
But don't be afraid.
No one knows.

661
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:35,125
My Mum would be upset,
so we're doing this secretly.

662
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:36,792
Tell me what you want,
I'll give you a discount.

663
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,250
Why are you laughing?

664
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,292
Sorry, couldn't hold it�

665
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,417
Why did you laugh?

666
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:52,833
Is there a spelling mistake?
Or is my costume not working?

667
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,083
You've been with me all day.
You saw what I can do.

668
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,542
Please, ask them to turn
these lights off?

669
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:58,625
It's hurting my eye.

670
00:38:58,667 --> 00:38:59,875
Don't we look like rowdies to you?

671
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:01,917
No!

672
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,250
You're not a rowdy.

673
00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:05,458
You're a fraud.

674
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,583
Rowdies are different from frauds.

675
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:10,792
Turn the lights off, guys.

676
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:17,250
Hello.

677
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:18,958
You can't see it in these lights.

678
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:21,042
What are you trying to say?

679
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:23,417
Rowdies are really brave.

680
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,583
But frauds just fake bravado.

681
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:32,292
Rowdies don't deceive anyone.
But frauds are very deceptive.

682
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:35,500
Like what you did this morning.

683
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:40,750
Real rowdies stand up against
men taller and stronger than themselves.

684
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:44,875
Unlike you, they don't hit small children.

685
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:47,042
Only frauds would do that.

686
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:50,208
How could you be a rowdy?

687
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:51,417
Please wait.

688
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,083
Stop! Stop�

689
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,042
What is your problem?

690
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:57,958
If I hit someone taller and stronger,
you'll admit that I'm a rowdy?

691
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:02,833
Be ready at 10 tomorrow morning.

692
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:18,292
There are so many people here.

693
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,125
Pick anyone you like.

694
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,583
I will hit them.
I will stand up against them.

695
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:35,458
See? There's a tall guy in a green shirt
walking towards us�

696
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:36,792
I don't see him.

697
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:37,292
Dude.

698
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:40,250
Him.

699
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:41,667
Him?

700
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:47,708
It will be violent...

701
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,000
It will be a violent fight.

702
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,125
No problem.

703
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,667
No, you'll get scared.

704
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,792
You go hide in there.

705
00:40:57,292 --> 00:40:58,708
Just watch me hit him.

706
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,083
Go.

707
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:06,875
Dude, he looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

708
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:08,500
He'll squeeze out your insides.

709
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:11,208
Look at her eyes.
Sweet, right?

710
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,500
Do what you must, dude.
Worth it.

711
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:20,250
Ready!

712
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:22,000
Let's kick it!
- Dude.

713
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,292
He'll surely thrash me.

714
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:26,417
I think he'll thrash me badly.

715
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:28,167
If my life is in danger�

716
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:28,958
I WILL COME SAVE YOU!

717
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,417
Dude!

718
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:34,917
Your priority is to make sure
she doesn't see me getting thrashed.

719
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:36,625
Okay, dude?
- Okay, dude.

720
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:37,542
Let's rock the world, dude.

721
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:38,250
Go, dude!

722
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,542
Who are you?

723
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:46,542
Who am I?

724
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,250
What's your bloody problem?
-Problem, huh?

725
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:51,083
I'll give you a problem.

726
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:54,000
I'll show you what a problem is?
- Show me.

727
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:56,208
Wait!
I'm just talking.

728
00:41:57,292 --> 00:41:59,125
Please! I'm just talking.

729
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,458
You're not hitting him?

730
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:06,792
Who the hell are you?

731
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,750
I'll kill you!
Rip your face apart�

732
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:11,250
Don't know who you're messing with.

733
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,250
Kada, hit him!

734
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:14,875
Think you're a big shot
just because you have a beard?

735
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:17,167
Yeah, what can you do?
- I'll shave you.

736
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:18,792
I'll kill you with my voice.

737
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:21,083
I am Tamil Nadu's favourite voice.

738
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:22,625
Your days are numbered�

739
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:24,833
You shall get bitten by a serpant, you sinner!

740
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:28,458
Just because you're tall.
One punch from me and you're finished.

741
00:42:28,542 --> 00:42:29,208
That's enough.

742
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:33,125
That's enough! Go.

743
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:34,708
Go!

744
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:38,333
We won the match, dude.

745
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:41,042
Brother, they hit me.

746
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:43,958
They humiliated me in the market
for the world to see.

747
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,250
I'll call you.

748
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,042
They're as terrifying as you were
ten years back.

749
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:50,958
Do you remember?
- No, Brother.

750
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:54,083
Do you remember their faces?
- Yes, Brother.

751
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:54,875
Snatch them.

752
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:56,833
Here, make fish curry for our Brother.

753
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:59,542
You caught them in the sea?
- No, the sewer.

754
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,417
Hi, Mummy. How are you?

755
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:29,125
How was your interview?

756
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:30,375
It was alright.

757
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,333
Just alright?

758
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:34,583
It was okay, Mummy.

759
00:43:36,042 --> 00:43:37,500
Here, drink this.

760
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:42,583
One more thing�

761
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,708
You know that deaf girl?

762
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:47,542
Don't talk like that, Mummy.

763
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:51,375
Yesterday, they found a corpse in the sea.

764
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:54,083
It's her father.

765
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:59,333
They've taken it for post mortem now.

766
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,917
No family member has claimed
the body yet.

767
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:05,417
It's a policeman's death
is an embarrassment to the department.

768
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:06,708
So they'll cover it up.

769
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,875
They'll say something about
investigation� but it's all a farce.

770
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:12,000
If you see the girl, bring her here.

771
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,542
Hello!

772
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:16,000
Heard you thrashed our man?

773
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,458
Brother is really pissed.

774
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:20,375
Your boys and the girl are in our custody.

775
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:21,958
He asked me to bring you in.

776
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,417
And if you refuse, to drag you in.

777
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:24,083
Let's go?

778
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:26,125
You've tied ME up?

779
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:30,875
Just ungag me if you dare.

780
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:34,833
Why have you tied me up?
Let me go.

781
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:42,750
When my dad's back,
I'll ask him to lock you all up.

782
00:44:43,042 --> 00:44:43,875
Miss...

783
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:46,708
Think we'll stand by and let your dad
lock us up?

784
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:49,042
You, Red T-shirt!
Stupid mongrel.

785
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:50,958
I remember your face.

786
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:53,000
You remember the face-
- You're so dead!

787
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:54,000
Can you hear me talking?

788
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,417
Dare to touch me?
Stupid mongrel.

789
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:56,625
Stop shouting, my ears hurt!

790
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:58,292
RED T-SHIRT!

791
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:01,500
Who is she swearing at?
Who is the mongrel?

792
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:02,958
You can't escape.

793
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:05,542
No one will escape.
We all shall die one day.

794
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:06,875
But you're screaming your lungs out.

795
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,625
I'll kill you, Red T-Shirt!

796
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:11,167
Hello, Sir.

797
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,583
I don't want a bank loan.
Go away.

798
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:14,208
No, Sir!

799
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,333
You've tied us up!

800
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,458
When our don comes,
you're all dead men.

801
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:20,833
I'm the don he's talking about.

802
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:21,667
Don?

803
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:23,875
If you're a don, what am I?

804
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,792
You're a DON, sir.

805
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:27,125
I'm a don, sir.

806
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:28,625
RED T-SHIRT!

807
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:30,458
See what happens when I tell Pandi.

808
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:31,333
Who is that?

809
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:32,500
It's me.

810
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:35,292
I was looking for you.
Sit down.

811
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:37,333
I said, sit.

812
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:41,167
So, why did you hit my guy?

813
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,750
Sir. It was just a game.

814
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:45,583
Your guy looked like softie.

815
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:47,250
So I thought
I could get away with hitting him.

816
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:48,667
He looks like a softie to you?

817
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,375
He looked soft earlier.

818
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:53,292
But today, he looks frightful.
I was just...

819
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,083
Rascal!

820
00:45:54,292 --> 00:45:54,958
You were playing?

821
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,583
We look like jokers to you?
- No, Sir.

822
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,708
You played?
You must pay a fine now.

823
00:46:00,042 --> 00:46:01,583
How many of his people are here?

824
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:02,625
There's eight of them.

825
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:04,958
Cough up 800 thousand and take them.

826
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,375
They're not worth so much, Sir.

827
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:08,458
Then pay 900 thousand, including yourself.

828
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:10,167
I'll give you ten days' time.

829
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:12,042
As you pay the amount,
I'll send them one by one.

830
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:14,250
But that girl who's yelling?
I'll send her last.

831
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:15,458
Wait till Pandi comes.

832
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:16,000
Go!

833
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,500
Please, Sir.
- I said go!

834
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:20,167
He'll beat you black and blue.

835
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:22,250
Stuff her mouth with cotton.

836
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,000
What are you glaring at?

837
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:25,583
Not glaring, just looking.

838
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:30,208
Are you blind? Just go.

839
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,000
Red T-Shirt, you dog�
- Shut up!

840
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,958
Ask that Red T-Shirt to change
his shirt.

841
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:38,833
Just a million?
No big deal.

842
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,792
Pay the guy off.
Throw this money at him...

843
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:42,500
Okay.

844
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,875
What?
- What happened?

845
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,125
Where's the money for lease?
- It was right here.

846
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:50,917
Stop!
- Sir, let me go.

847
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,500
Wait. What is it?
Forgot something?

848
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:54,875
No, Sir. It's the money.

849
00:46:55,417 --> 00:46:57,167
Yes, the money.
I gave you ten days' time.

850
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:58,417
Arrange for it.

851
00:46:58,625 --> 00:46:59,958
I've got money, Sir.

852
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,542
You've got� the money?

853
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,208
Yes. I've got it, sir.

854
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:05,083
Come here.

855
00:47:05,292 --> 00:47:06,000
Come, son.

856
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:07,208
Come on.

857
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:09,375
He says he's brought it.

858
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:13,583
Red T-shirt, you dog!
I remember your face�

859
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:18,125
Aathma! Kumar� Get here, guys.
Count it.

860
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,250
Count it.

861
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,583
Don't let the boys get away
while you're counting.

862
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:22,625
Be careful.

863
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:23,750
How much is it?

864
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:24,833
A million, Brother.

865
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,375
A million?
Son, we only asked for 900 thousand.

866
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:30,792
I just grabbed handfuls of it.
I didn't count it.

867
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:31,750
Grabbed handfuls?

868
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,583
Look at that gesture!
He says he grabbed handfuls!

869
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:35,792
Sit down.

870
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:38,083
Just be seated.
We'll talk.

871
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:40,750
Where did you grab it from?

872
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:43,083
You asked for the money.
I gave it. Let them go.

873
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:46,333
I hardly make ten thousand these days.
How did you get a million?

874
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:48,417
No, please let us go.
I'm scared, sir.

875
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,250
Scared?
What, of me?

876
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:51,208
No, Sir.

877
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:53,542
Him.

878
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:54,250
Who?

879
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:55,875
He's glaring at me.
It's scary.

880
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:56,792
Him?

881
00:47:57,167 --> 00:48:00,042
God, come with me.
I'll tell you a sad little story.

882
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:00,708
No, sir!

883
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:02,458
No, no no!
- Out of my way.

884
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:04,250
Come this way.
Don't be afraid.

885
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:06,125
Stand here.
Closer to him.

886
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,083
Touch him.

887
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:09,708
Just touch him.

888
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:11,708
So you touched. Did he do anything?
- No.

889
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,333
Now, thump his head.
- No, sir.

890
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:14,542
Just thump him.

891
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:16,542
Thump him hard.
Go on.

892
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,625
Did he do anything?

893
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:18,958
He went to sleep a long time back.

894
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:21,042
I can't afford his medical treatment.

895
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,917
Just hold his head this way.
He'll hold it still.

896
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:25,750
Where are you going?

897
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:26,833
Sit down.
- No, sir.

898
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:28,167
This is your rightful place. Sit.

899
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,083
Sit down.

900
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:29,958
Greetings, sir.

901
00:48:29,958 --> 00:48:31,000
Greet him properly.

902
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:32,083
GREETINGS, SIR.

903
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:37,208
I'll do anything you say.
But just�

904
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,458
You wouldn't have done this
if my dad were here.

905
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,958
Why are you doing this to me, Miss?

906
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:44,042
What does the girl want?

907
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:45,542
Sir, that's my girl.

908
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:48,042
She thinks I'm the man.

909
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:53,083
She keeps yelling about this Red T-Shirt.
If I can have him�

910
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:56,208
I'll just thrash him in front of her.

911
00:48:56,417 --> 00:48:57,500
You do that.

912
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:59,333
Red T-Shirt. Where is he?
Where is he..?

913
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:00,208
Here he is!

914
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:01,458
Come here.

915
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:04,125
Brother, I've been shirtless all day.

916
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:05,458
Why did you remove your shirt?

917
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:06,375
Hands off me.

918
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:12,042
Remove the blindfold when I tell you.
Okay?

919
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:12,667
Okay.

920
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:52,917
Red T-Shirt. You dog.

921
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:54,375
I told you!

922
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,708
Apparently, she told you.

923
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:03,250
Of course you did.
Not once, but a million times.

924
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:07,167
Kadhu!

925
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:08,708
Are you okay, baby?

926
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:11,083
Why is he speaking in sign language?
Oh, she can't hear?

927
00:50:11,292 --> 00:50:13,458
Darn, I've been yelling all day.

928
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,083
Thank you very much. Please go.

929
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:30,458
Is it confirmed?
- Yes, it's her father.

930
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:33,292
How do I tell her?

931
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:47,500
I can get the girl to say it.

932
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,708
Okay, get her to say it.

933
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:50,875
Don't you trust me?
Ask her to say it.

934
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:59,250
Kadhambari, shall I get this done?

935
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:14,708
Listen, it's wrong to hide it from her.
Just tell her now.

936
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,583
Sit. We can go later.

937
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,167
Tell her.

938
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,333
Your dad�

939
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:29,125
Dad?

940
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,417
What happened to Dad?

941
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:32,875
It's fine, just tell her.

942
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:37,500
Your dad, uh...
Four days ago�

943
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:39,333
What happened to Dad?

944
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:40,417
Hey!

945
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:43,000
Your dad wants to talk to you.

946
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:44,708
He asked me to stay by the phone.

947
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:46,500
Don't just start crying
every time I say "Dad".

948
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:47,292
Call your dad.

949
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:49,583
Dude, you're hiding her father's death.
- What do I do?

950
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:50,750
Why didn't he text me?

951
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:53,083
When she gets to know, she will cry anyway.

952
00:51:59,042 --> 00:52:00,167
Go answer the call.

953
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:08,708
Dude, this is plain wrong.

954
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:10,083
Hello, sir?

955
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:11,292
Dad!

956
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,792
How are you?
When will you come back?

957
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:15,417
You could have messaged me.

958
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:21,208
He says he's fine.
He wants to know if you're okay.

959
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:25,542
I'm okay, Dad.
When are you coming? Tell me.

960
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:27,875
He says he's coming back tomorrow.

961
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:30,083
There's some problem.
So he's getting delayed.

962
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:31,417
What's the problem, Dad?

963
00:52:31,458 --> 00:52:32,958
Oh no...
- Are you hurt..?

964
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:36,250
It's nothing major.
He says he'll come see you soon.

965
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:40,250
Dad, please come back.

966
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,333
She is crying.

967
00:52:44,542 --> 00:52:45,583
This feels terrible.

968
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:49,375
He asks why you're crying.

969
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,458
Don't tell him!
No, Dad. I'm not crying.

970
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,250
Sir, she's crying.

971
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:55,833
Don't tell him!

972
00:52:56,417 --> 00:52:57,583
She says not to tell you.

973
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,000
Smile, then.

974
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,042
Dad, I'm okay.

975
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:09,542
What will you do
when she finds out?

976
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:11,500
Listen to me, man.

977
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:14,000
This has to stop. Tell her the truth.
- I'll take care, sir.

978
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:16,167
Pandi, this is wrong...
- Don't worry, sir.

979
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:20,625
Your dad is perfectly alright.

980
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:22,667
He just needs his daughter to be happy.

981
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,375
So please smile a little.

982
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,250
Smile, please.

983
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:41,333
He's not a good boy;
He's not a bad boy.

984
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:43,708
He's a bit of both;
Our boy is.

985
00:53:43,792 --> 00:53:47,042
Pandi, Dad texted he will be back in two days.
- See, that's it.

986
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:48,042
Superb right?
- Super!

987
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:49,083
Happy now?

988
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:54,667
Not a great don like Basha;
He's not so great

989
00:53:55,083 --> 00:54:00,083
Not a wrong-doer like Ranga;
He's not a baddy

990
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:03,667
No guns, no blood;
But he's a rowdy now

991
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:06,500
He's got the time for love;
He's a rowdy

992
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:09,292
He doesn't like violence;
Though he's a rowdy

993
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,125
He's a real fraud;
He's a rowdy anyway

994
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:26,750
I'm a rowdy, too.

995
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:32,292
I'm a rowdy, too.

996
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,958
Ten birds in a stone;
This guy hit them all

997
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:59,250
Chop to pieces in a single blow;
He can do that, too

998
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:02,833
Is there a small scene?
Our man will stand by and watch

999
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:05,583
Is there a big scene?
He'll talk it out

1000
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:08,417
If speaking the truth
Would cause you pain

1001
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:11,333
He'd lie to you;
Just to make you smile

1002
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:24,000
I know it's wrong.

1003
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:25,708
But there's something right
about it. Right?

1004
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,500
She's happy now.

1005
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:30,000
Let her cry when she finds out
that her father is dead.

1006
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,042
Go to hell, dude.
- What's your problem?

1007
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:35,500
What happened?
Let's go.

1008
00:55:35,542 --> 00:55:36,833
It's nothing.

1009
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,125
Let's go?

1010
00:55:38,292 --> 00:55:39,250
Chorus start!

1011
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:41,792
He won't blow smoke
On your face

1012
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:44,208
He won't get drunk
And be a pain

1013
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,458
He won't do mischief with girls

1014
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:50,292
But I swear to God;
He's a rowdy

1015
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,042
Sit down.

1016
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:42,250
Look at me.

1017
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:46,250
Five to six days back�

1018
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:48,833
Your father passed away.

1019
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,958
I asked Pandi to inform you.

1020
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:58,125
I don't know why he didn't tell you.

1021
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:04,375
If you have any family,
I'll drop you at their place.

1022
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:07,542
It's not nice to roam around
with these boys.

1023
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:10,917
Did you get what I just said?

1024
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:13,167
Did you?

1025
00:57:14,792 --> 00:57:15,292
No�

1026
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,958
That's not possible, Auntie.

1027
00:57:20,667 --> 00:57:24,375
I spoke to my Dad over the phone
just yesterday.

1028
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:31,542
He always does this.

1029
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:35,583
He keeps travelling on
one case or the other.

1030
00:57:37,042 --> 00:57:39,042
But he always comes back.

1031
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,917
Pandi knows all about it.

1032
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,708
Ask him.

1033
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:49,708
Pandi�

1034
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:53,542
Didn't we talk to Dad yesterday?

1035
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:56,958
She's saying terrible things.

1036
00:57:58,083 --> 00:57:59,625
Tell her, Pandi.
- Miss.

1037
00:58:00,417 --> 00:58:01,250
Look here.

1038
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:03,500
This guy�

1039
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,833
He knows everything.

1040
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:08,833
He didn't tell you or tell me.

1041
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:12,167
He used my name to
do the cremation.

1042
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:20,375
Pandi.

1043
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:24,583
Dad is alive, right?

1044
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:30,708
She is lying, isn't she?

1045
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:50,708
Relatives...

1046
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:57,583
I have no family.

1047
00:58:57,917 --> 00:58:59,292
I will manage.

1048
00:59:13,792 --> 00:59:14,708
What is your problem?

1049
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:09,167
Kadhambari!

1050
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:11,292
Call her.

1051
01:00:11,917 --> 01:00:12,875
Go closer to her.

1052
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:19,542
Miss!
He's calling you.

1053
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,500
You're laying hands on a cop?

1054
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:33,417
Lawmen are like serpents.

1055
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:35,750
Once they coil your leg, they never let go.

1056
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:52,583
He's a cop.

1057
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:54,833
Pack this properly.
And wash it..

1058
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:56,917
Can't trust anybody.

1059
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:59,417
Nobody saw us, right?
Let's go.

1060
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,667
Pandi, come on!

1061
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:27,125
She's crying.

1062
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:28,458
I feel helpless.

1063
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:30,042
Of course, she is!

1064
01:01:31,542 --> 01:01:33,625
Pandi, why are you crying?

1065
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:35,208
Then who will take care of her?

1066
01:01:36,542 --> 01:01:38,750
I've brought you food.
Eat and take some for her.

1067
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:41,375
Pandi!

1068
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:06,167
Look at me.
I want to talk to you.

1069
01:02:08,083 --> 01:02:09,333
What could I do, Kadhambari?

1070
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:12,333
I chose to lie and get you to smile�

1071
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,542
Rather than telling you the truth
that would make you cry.

1072
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:19,208
You kept saying you would
hurt yourself if your dad was hurt.

1073
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:20,458
What was I supposed to do?

1074
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:25,375
You were bound to find out
about your dad's death someday.

1075
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:30,417
But I didn't want to be the one
to tell you.

1076
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:35,708
Your dad's been dead for six days.
But weren't you happy?

1077
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:37,250
I was hoping these six days...

1078
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,125
Would span into six months
or six years.

1079
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,125
I know you have no one.

1080
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,458
I also know that I'll be your person
from now.

1081
01:02:47,917 --> 01:02:51,375
I'll take much better care of you
than even your dad�

1082
01:02:51,417 --> 01:02:52,250
That I'm sure of.

1083
01:02:54,792 --> 01:02:56,750
You must cry when you dad dies.
That is the right thing.

1084
01:02:56,792 --> 01:02:58,083
Sit and cry it out.

1085
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:01,292
But I can't bear to see it.

1086
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:03,792
When you are done crying,
I'll be there for you.

1087
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,583
I've brought you food.

1088
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:22,375
Eat up.

1089
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:24,458
If you need me, message me.
Or call.

1090
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,333
I'll know what it is.
I'll come over.

1091
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:32,792
Pandi.

1092
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:35,292
Tell me.

1093
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:40,917
I would have liked to see him
one last time.

1094
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:46,667
Forget everything.
Eat and get some rest.

1095
01:04:50,292 --> 01:04:50,958
See you.

1096
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:00,458
Pandi!

1097
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:03,708
Pandi, have you left?

1098
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:07,708
I haven't left you anywhere.
I'm right here.

1099
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:09,000
I'm alone, Pandi.

1100
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:12,083
I'm right here.

1101
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:24,292
Will you always be by my side
and take care of me?

1102
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:26,292
I promise you, I will.

1103
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:45,583
Are you going to kiss me?

1104
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:49,042
Will you do anything for me?

1105
01:05:50,042 --> 01:05:50,708
I will.

1106
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:54,625
There is one person in this world
that I hate the most.

1107
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:56,833
He must die.

1108
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,583
By that, I don't mean
shooting from a distance...

1109
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,375
Or hiring a hitman.

1110
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:06,750
I want you to hold him from behind.

1111
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:09,250
And I want to stab him.

1112
01:06:11,708 --> 01:06:13,792
How could I be happy while he lives?

1113
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:16,583
How could I be in love
when I'm not happy?

1114
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:18,875
How could I kiss you
if I'm not in love?

1115
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:22,583
If you can do it...

1116
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,917
We can kiss for however long.

1117
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:28,542
If you can't...

1118
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:32,708
Go ahead with your life.

1119
01:06:33,917 --> 01:06:36,042
I'll go after him
first thing in the morning.

1120
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:38,833
This is my life now.

1121
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:41,708
You tell me.

1122
01:06:56,375 --> 01:06:57,000
Okay�

1123
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:58,583
I'll surely try.

1124
01:07:02,792 --> 01:07:04,417
You hesitated for ten seconds.

1125
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:07,167
You can't do it.

1126
01:07:08,917 --> 01:07:09,917
I will do it!

1127
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:12,833
No, I'll handle it.

1128
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:18,667
I was thinking how to�

1129
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:20,292
I'll see you in the morning.

1130
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:23,792
I'm going to sleep now.

1131
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:49,417
I knew you had an issue.

1132
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:50,667
I would have helped you sooner.

1133
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:52,333
But you went to Pandi first.

1134
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:53,833
It won't be nice if I butt in.

1135
01:07:54,167 --> 01:07:54,833
That's why.

1136
01:07:55,083 --> 01:07:56,958
You've come to me now.
I'll handle it.

1137
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,625
Don't worry about it.
Come on.

1138
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:02,667
Why would this girl go with him?

1139
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:07,625
Pandi?

1140
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:10,708
I've sorted everything out.

1141
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:12,625
They are the big shots
in this hood.

1142
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:14,708
They'll do a great job.
Okay?

1143
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,082
I'm here. I'll handle it.

1144
01:08:27,707 --> 01:08:29,292
Fish gravy?

1145
01:08:29,542 --> 01:08:31,250
Smells great.
- I'm sure.

1146
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,375
You only come home for food.

1147
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:39,832
Sis, who is that chick?

1148
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:42,000
She's a cousin.
We're arranging your marriage.

1149
01:08:42,082 --> 01:08:42,957
Will you marry her?

1150
01:08:43,832 --> 01:08:44,625
Shut up!

1151
01:08:44,832 --> 01:08:46,875
There's a girl involved.
Looks like an important affair.

1152
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:47,832
We'll handle it.

1153
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:50,292
Let that fish go.

1154
01:08:51,042 --> 01:08:52,042
Let go.

1155
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,792
Helping me with gravy�?

1156
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:57,250
You're talking too much.
I'll handle it.

1157
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:06,917
We must leave immediately.

1158
01:09:07,417 --> 01:09:08,082
Why?

1159
01:09:09,082 --> 01:09:10,957
These people can't do anything to him.

1160
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:13,417
No, these people are the big guns here.

1161
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:15,707
What?
- Listen to me, you fool!

1162
01:09:15,707 --> 01:09:19,000
You oaf. She's not even alone.
She's come with a guy.

1163
01:09:19,207 --> 01:09:20,417
She's come with a guy?

1164
01:09:22,042 --> 01:09:22,832
Yes.

1165
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,042
I didn't even notice him.

1166
01:09:32,332 --> 01:09:34,250
Sis.
Now she's alone.

1167
01:09:34,457 --> 01:09:35,042
Anwar.

1168
01:09:35,332 --> 01:09:36,667
Anwar, get up.

1169
01:09:36,957 --> 01:09:38,000
We must leave.

1170
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:39,542
Anwar, get up.

1171
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:41,000
Oh no!

1172
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:47,042
It's alright. He'll wake up in five minutes.

1173
01:09:48,957 --> 01:09:51,542
The last I saw a girl like you
was at the malls.

1174
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:53,457
My boys would never believe my luck.
Let's take a picture?

1175
01:09:53,542 --> 01:09:54,792
Just for evidence?

1176
01:09:57,667 --> 01:09:58,833
Smile.

1177
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,542
Hey, where did you go?

1178
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:01,792
Brother, she's my girl.

1179
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:02,875
Anwar, wake up!

1180
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,042
Wait a second!

1181
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:05,958
Who are you?
I don't know you.

1182
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:07,250
I'm from the hood.

1183
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:08,458
And who is he?

1184
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:10,250
He's my friend, Anwar.

1185
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:11,708
Who are you, then?

1186
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:13,417
I'm the guy.

1187
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:15,167
Her boyfriend.

1188
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:16,000
She's my girl.

1189
01:10:16,042 --> 01:10:17,042
Who am I, then?

1190
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:19,417
Don't know that.
She didn't know.

1191
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,500
No problem.

1192
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:22,208
Now we're both friends.

1193
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,250
Okay, you're friends!

1194
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:24,375
Superb.

1195
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:24,875
Let's go.

1196
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:26,500
Bye Brother.
- Wait!

1197
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:28,625
What is it, brother?

1198
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:30,833
Don't make a fuss...
- Okay.

1199
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:32,458
I was looking at her�

1200
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:35,000
Just once...
- What?

1201
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:37,208
Ask her to hug me once.

1202
01:10:38,042 --> 01:10:39,583
You're kidding?
Go on, Brother.

1203
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:40,792
Anwar, get up. Let's go.

1204
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:44,000
Who's kidding?

1205
01:10:44,667 --> 01:10:45,542
Ask her to hug me.

1206
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:46,875
Or I'll knife her face.

1207
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:49,542
We were just talking.
Why flash a knife?

1208
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:51,917
Am I serious enough now?
Ask her to hug me.

1209
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:54,000
I'll tell her.
First, drop the knife.

1210
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:57,000
Suresh, what are you doing?

1211
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,708
Hug him like he were your brother.
We can leave.

1212
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:06,583
No other go.

1213
01:11:06,875 --> 01:11:09,625
I don't care what you think.
Just want a hug.

1214
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:21,625
Okay, go ahead.

1215
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:23,500
It's okay.

1216
01:11:23,917 --> 01:11:25,875
I knew you'd like me.

1217
01:11:30,708 --> 01:11:31,708
He hit me!

1218
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:33,000
Let's go.

1219
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:54,708
Who are you?

1220
01:11:54,792 --> 01:11:55,458
Why are you running?

1221
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,708
I heard Granny is ailing.

1222
01:11:56,917 --> 01:11:57,667
How is she?

1223
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:02,458
Let's go!

1224
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:27,083
Are you out of your mind?

1225
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:29,208
He's a nobody,
and you went there with him?

1226
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,625
Is that any place for you?

1227
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:32,292
What if I'd come a little later?

1228
01:12:39,667 --> 01:12:42,250
I wanted to kiss the girl I loved.

1229
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:44,667
And you demanded that I
stab a guy and kill him.

1230
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:47,375
Anyone would need ten seconds to think.

1231
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:48,583
Definitely would.

1232
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:53,458
You'd say I'm a waste,
a good-for-nothing, and walk away?

1233
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,208
I'm talking to you!

1234
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:05,417
Kadhu...

1235
01:13:05,667 --> 01:13:07,667
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

1236
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:09,583
I can't keep repeating myself.

1237
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:12,417
Are you out of your mind?

1238
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:15,958
I can guess what you'd have said.

1239
01:13:16,917 --> 01:13:18,542
You don't have to repeat yourself.

1240
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:21,292
Kadhu.

1241
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:22,958
Look at me.

1242
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:28,042
There's this girl I like the most
in this world.

1243
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:31,167
I'd never refused her anything.

1244
01:13:31,542 --> 01:13:32,917
She asked me for something�

1245
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:34,958
I thought about it for ten seconds.

1246
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:36,250
It was my mistake.

1247
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:38,500
It wasn't such a big deal.

1248
01:13:39,542 --> 01:13:41,042
There is this guy she hates.

1249
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:42,875
She wants him dead.

1250
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:44,958
I should hold him from behind...

1251
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,875
while she stabs him.

1252
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:49,083
That's how he should die.

1253
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:50,625
I'm going to do that.

1254
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:51,792
So...

1255
01:13:52,792 --> 01:13:56,458
If you're okay with that,
you can kiss me. No problem.

1256
01:13:57,542 --> 01:13:59,458
If you are not�

1257
01:14:00,083 --> 01:14:01,708
You've come close enough.

1258
01:14:02,292 --> 01:14:04,417
So just kiss me and go.

1259
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:08,958
Aside the fact that my lover
asked me�

1260
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:11,500
I have to do this, right?

1261
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:15,917
I'm a rowdy, too.
Right?

1262
01:14:58,042 --> 01:14:58,542
Dude!

1263
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:00,917
We've done small time jobs till now.

1264
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:04,875
But our Kadhambari has brought us
a big assignment.

1265
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:06,042
Superb!

1266
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:10,417
The job is�

1267
01:15:11,792 --> 01:15:14,750
We're all going to commit
a murder together.

1268
01:15:14,792 --> 01:15:16,917
Awesome! Who? When?
Where are we doing it?

1269
01:15:17,417 --> 01:15:18,708
Punch your face!

1270
01:15:19,292 --> 01:15:21,542
No, keep that fire burning.

1271
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:24,292
Are you serious?

1272
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:26,167
I'm serious.
We're going to commit murder.

1273
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,833
Murder, like in the movies where
the villain stabs and blood splashes?

1274
01:15:30,042 --> 01:15:30,625
Like�

1275
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:34,125
I'll hold him back and Kadhambari
will stab him.

1276
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:34,875
That's all.

1277
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:35,875
Her?

1278
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:40,417
She can't hear squat.
She'll commit murder?

1279
01:15:40,542 --> 01:15:41,083
Dude.

1280
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,375
What should I do?

1281
01:15:42,708 --> 01:15:44,875
Dude, we're plotting it together.

1282
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:45,792
We'll plan it, dude.

1283
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:46,833
Like that?

1284
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:47,917
I'll plot it.

1285
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:49,500
Then she'll do that guy.

1286
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:50,708
Then you'll�

1287
01:15:51,458 --> 01:15:53,125
Fall in love and marry her.

1288
01:15:53,292 --> 01:15:53,875
That's all.

1289
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:55,750
Is everyone okay with the plan?

1290
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:56,375
Pandi.

1291
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,292
What's your doubt?

1292
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,375
Kamakshi is sick.

1293
01:16:00,417 --> 01:16:02,250
Oh no! My Kamakshi is sick?

1294
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:02,875
Dude.

1295
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:06,792
MY Kamakshi is sick.
I'll go get her medicines.

1296
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:08,833
Take care of sister.

1297
01:16:09,917 --> 01:16:11,542
There's no one to man the shop.
I should get going.

1298
01:16:12,792 --> 01:16:15,000
Grandpa hasn't eaten lunch.
I'll get him something and be back.

1299
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:17,875
Grandpa� Let's go.
- I won't go with you.

1300
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,375
Go with him now, Grandpa.
I'll WhatsApp you the plan.

1301
01:16:20,417 --> 01:16:21,292
Keep this fire burning.

1302
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:22,958
Okay?
- Okay, WhatsApp me.

1303
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,917
I'm waiting.

1304
01:16:24,917 --> 01:16:25,542
Kadhambari�

1305
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:27,625
What did you think?

1306
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,583
That we're real rowdies?

1307
01:16:30,042 --> 01:16:30,917
We're something else.

1308
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:32,833
It's a thin line.

1309
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:35,125
On this side of the line,
we're the dons.

1310
01:16:35,667 --> 01:16:38,208
Step to the other side,
and death awaits.

1311
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:40,708
You ass!
Just shut up.

1312
01:16:41,417 --> 01:16:42,000
Kadhambari�

1313
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:45,292
Tell us whom to kill and where.
We can start planning.

1314
01:16:46,542 --> 01:16:47,125
Look.

1315
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:50,042
There's no point talking about him here.

1316
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:52,417
The three of us shall go to Chennai.

1317
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:55,000
We will draft our plan there.
Let's go.

1318
01:16:55,292 --> 01:16:56,542
We'll need a car tomorrow.

1319
01:16:56,792 --> 01:16:58,167
Call 4000 4000 for a cab.

1320
01:16:58,792 --> 01:17:00,167
Pandi, I'm sorry.

1321
01:17:00,208 --> 01:17:00,917
Anwar.

1322
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:04,125
If your friend loves a girl,
you should just let go�

1323
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:08,667
And go away.
No matter how much you like the girl.

1324
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,667
But talking to her when
I'm not talking;

1325
01:17:11,708 --> 01:17:12,875
Sending her messages
when I'm not messaging;

1326
01:17:12,917 --> 01:17:13,917
And calling her when
I'm not calling�

1327
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:15,458
Taking her out
when I'm not...

1328
01:17:15,833 --> 01:17:17,292
There's just one word for it.

1329
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,000
Cheap.

1330
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:22,125
When you're in love,
there will be problems and fights.

1331
01:17:22,167 --> 01:17:23,500
We will drift apart.

1332
01:17:24,167 --> 01:17:26,750
But that's when I will begin to miss her.
And she'd miss me.

1333
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:29,042
We'll love each other more.
And our bond will be stronger.

1334
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,917
If you try to butt in
and use it to your favour�

1335
01:17:34,792 --> 01:17:36,417
You won't get squat.

1336
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:41,125
Wherever she goes, she'll come back to me.
Because, my love is true.

1337
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:42,125
Sorry, dude.

1338
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,417
Get lost, man.

1339
01:17:46,417 --> 01:17:47,083
Dude?

1340
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,000
This car is killing my revenge mood.
- That's the point.

1341
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:51,042
Get into the love mood.

1342
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,417
What if it rains?

1343
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:53,667
We'll eat fried chillies.

1344
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:02,542
Are you okay, baby?

1345
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:15,042
The time when you and I
Are together

1346
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:22,042
There is no blue in the skies;
It's white, white everywhere.

1347
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:27,042
As we go
These roads they stretch before us

1348
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:34,167
The clouds kiss my skin;
With the softest of raindrops

1349
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:39,667
I will let go of all my fear;
And all my greed

1350
01:18:40,042 --> 01:18:46,208
Through good times and bad;
I will be yours

1351
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:55,333
I'm the day and night;
You're my sun and moon

1352
01:18:55,833 --> 01:19:01,208
Your pretty umbrella;
Cloaks me from the rain

1353
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:07,458
I'm the day and night;
You're the silver moon

1354
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:13,583
During my slumber;
You're my sweetest dream

1355
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:20,125
I want you�
Always, everywhere.

1356
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:25,292
You're all I want.

1357
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:23,875
In the dead silence;
You were the sweet melody

1358
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:26,875
That filled the air

1359
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:29,833
You whispered words of love

1360
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:38,583
Silence has no language;
Your eyes strung words together

1361
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:42,125
Your eyes strung words together

1362
01:20:42,292 --> 01:20:47,708
I want to live
An eternity with you

1363
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:51,167
My home yearns your presence

1364
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:26,458
All I want to get through life�
Is you, my love

1365
01:22:06,792 --> 01:22:07,792
Baby!

1366
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:08,583
Baby!

1367
01:22:09,667 --> 01:22:11,042
Hello, mic testing.

1368
01:22:11,583 --> 01:22:12,917
Wow!

1369
01:22:13,792 --> 01:22:15,875
"Every dog has it's day;"

1370
01:22:15,917 --> 01:22:19,458
"Vote for us, we'll make you day!"

1371
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:20,458
Next?

1372
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:23,750
"If your wife contested in elections�"

1373
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:25,458
"What would you do?"

1374
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:32,292
"Do for me, what you'd do to your wife.
I'll protect your home."

1375
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:35,292
You shall contest in this election.
But relax now.

1376
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:38,292
This is called baby-sitting.

1377
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,667
I'll go meet the Leader.

1378
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:44,208
Don't be jealous, you oaf.

1379
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,583
There's a case filed against you.
You can't contest.

1380
01:22:46,792 --> 01:22:49,875
I'm not contesting.
Baby will contest.

1381
01:22:49,917 --> 01:22:51,958
Babies can crawl.
And suck their thumbs.

1382
01:22:53,042 --> 01:22:55,042
Mansoor, don't interrupt me.

1383
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:57,208
You haven't won even once
in these ten years.

1384
01:22:57,375 --> 01:22:58,625
How will Baby win?

1385
01:22:58,792 --> 01:23:02,250
Leader, people in the hood
respect Baby's big heart.

1386
01:23:02,292 --> 01:23:03,667
You should see the way
they look at her.

1387
01:23:03,792 --> 01:23:05,042
They look at her, alright!

1388
01:23:05,792 --> 01:23:06,833
Shut up, man.

1389
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,625
If Baby contests, we will win.

1390
01:23:09,667 --> 01:23:12,333
My decade long toil
will bear fruits.

1391
01:23:12,417 --> 01:23:14,750
Your won't get fruits or veggies.
Only nuts.

1392
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I'll chop you off!

1393
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,792
Listen to me.
Let it go this one time.

1394
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:19,958
Let T.B.K contest.

1395
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:21,458
Trying to scare me?
- Leader...

1396
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:25,167
Just this one time...
I will make my Baby win.

1397
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,333
You threaten me but you beg him!

1398
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:29,625
Talk to me like that again�

1399
01:23:30,167 --> 01:23:31,375
I will kill you, man!

1400
01:23:31,417 --> 01:23:33,000
Let go, idiots.

1401
01:23:33,292 --> 01:23:35,458
What's this behaviour?
Fighting like little kids.

1402
01:23:35,833 --> 01:23:36,750
Go away!

1403
01:23:38,375 --> 01:23:40,333
What happened?
- It's nothing.

1404
01:23:40,542 --> 01:23:41,375
Go inside.
Just go!

1405
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,417
Should get rid of them first...

1406
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:47,167
Look, there's fifteen days left
to file the nomination.

1407
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:51,833
Whoever is alive in fifteen days' time
can be the contestant.

1408
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:55,917
Meanwhile, go fight elsewhere.
Get out of my sight.

1409
01:24:14,167 --> 01:24:16,167
She's brought us to Killivalavan's area.

1410
01:24:16,625 --> 01:24:18,750
They'll bury offenders even for
the smallest issues.

1411
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:20,292
Go!

1412
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,792
This way.
- No, that way.

1413
01:24:26,042 --> 01:24:27,375
Don't confuse me.
- Okay.

1414
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:35,000
Pandi, come here.

1415
01:24:38,042 --> 01:24:38,667
Saw this?

1416
01:24:38,917 --> 01:24:41,708
A man from our hood
is now ruling the whole of North Madras.

1417
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,917
If her target is one of his boys,
just divorce her.

1418
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:46,958
Or let us part ways.

1419
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:48,500
No such thing. Wait!

1420
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,208
Kadhu, dear!
- Go closer, moron.

1421
01:24:51,667 --> 01:24:52,958
Kadhu, come here.

1422
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:57,667
Tell me if the guy we're looking for
is one of his men�

1423
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:59,500
Tell me if it's one of his men..?

1424
01:25:01,292 --> 01:25:02,708
Not one of his men�

1425
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:04,667
Jolly!

1426
01:25:06,042 --> 01:25:07,208
It's him! Him.

1427
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:09,625
This tiger will attack.

1428
01:25:09,792 --> 01:25:11,125
This tiger will pounce.

1429
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:12,500
This is a legend!

1430
01:25:18,042 --> 01:25:21,750
I just pissed every last drop
of water in my body. Right?

1431
01:25:22,542 --> 01:25:23,125
I know, right?

1432
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:27,042
You got drunk.
Why should I throw up?

1433
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:28,750
You're my friend, right?

1434
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:30,833
Right?

1435
01:25:33,917 --> 01:25:35,333
It just won't stop flowing.

1436
01:25:35,958 --> 01:25:36,583
Right?

1437
01:25:38,042 --> 01:25:40,042
You gave her your word
because you have my support.

1438
01:25:40,417 --> 01:25:40,917
I get it.

1439
01:25:41,042 --> 01:25:42,250
Okay. We'll do it.
- Dude!

1440
01:25:42,375 --> 01:25:43,333
Superb! Thanks.

1441
01:25:44,167 --> 01:25:45,583
But ask her for some time.

1442
01:25:45,792 --> 01:25:46,583
How many days?

1443
01:25:47,167 --> 01:25:47,917
Ten years?

1444
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:55,583
Ten years is the least.
He's middle aged now.

1445
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:57,625
He'll be in his old age in ten years.
We'll kill him.

1446
01:25:57,667 --> 01:25:59,292
You'll get married by then.

1447
01:25:59,542 --> 01:26:00,167
You'll have babies.

1448
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:02,833
Her maternal instincts will kick in
and she wouldn't want revenge.

1449
01:26:02,917 --> 01:26:04,250
Won't you stop yapping?

1450
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:05,208
The car is here.

1451
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,250
Be vigilant. Do your parts.

1452
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:08,833
I'll take my position. Okay?

1453
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:11,583
She's crazy.

1454
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,833
Did I say something wrong to the Leader?

1455
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,333
Yes son, you were wrong.

1456
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:21,042
Well, I know why I laughed.

1457
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,750
But why did he laugh that way?

1458
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:26,958
Look, you've just
become the villain.

1459
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,208
He's been a villain for ages.

1460
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:32,542
Don't go by the usual routes.
It's not safe.

1461
01:26:32,667 --> 01:26:34,583
T.B.K might have sent his men.
- So?

1462
01:26:34,792 --> 01:26:35,792
We need to watch out...

1463
01:26:35,792 --> 01:26:37,375
Someone's coming!
- Go check them out.

1464
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,208
Stop!

1465
01:26:38,417 --> 01:26:39,375
I can't do this.

1466
01:26:39,417 --> 01:26:41,500
Let's just tell them the truth.

1467
01:26:41,667 --> 01:26:42,458
Okay, I will.

1468
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:44,333
Drop our Brother back home.
- Okay.

1469
01:26:44,667 --> 01:26:45,500
What are you doing here?

1470
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:47,583
We wanted to take a tour of these
boats and ships�

1471
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:49,250
You tell me.
Why are you here?

1472
01:26:49,292 --> 01:26:50,292
Isn't that why we came here?

1473
01:26:50,458 --> 01:26:50,958
And him?

1474
01:26:51,042 --> 01:26:52,625
The girl�
- What girl?

1475
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:54,833
Stop, let him talk.

1476
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:55,625
Shut up.

1477
01:26:55,667 --> 01:26:56,875
You. Talk now.

1478
01:26:58,333 --> 01:26:58,917
TALK!

1479
01:26:58,958 --> 01:27:00,292
I came to buy flour.

1480
01:27:00,875 --> 01:27:01,875
You came to buy flour?

1481
01:27:02,042 --> 01:27:03,833
My granny makes pancakes
from this flour.

1482
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,375
Go straight home.

1483
01:27:05,458 --> 01:27:06,208
Don't loiter here.

1484
01:27:06,292 --> 01:27:07,042
Who are they?

1485
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:08,625
They came to buy flour.

1486
01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:44,333
Brother, watch out!

1487
01:27:58,542 --> 01:27:59,208
Who sent you?

1488
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:30,333
Die!

1489
01:28:31,958 --> 01:28:32,542
Kadhambari.

1490
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:36,000
We've seen all that we need to.

1491
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:37,792
Let's plan and come back?

1492
01:28:42,042 --> 01:28:42,958
Shut him up.

1493
01:28:44,542 --> 01:28:45,833
Press him down.

1494
01:28:47,708 --> 01:28:48,417
Let's go.

1495
01:28:53,292 --> 01:28:54,667
Baby, are you okay?

1496
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:57,292
I've been waiting in this saree
for so long!

1497
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,208
You went to meet some woman?
- Darn.

1498
01:29:02,917 --> 01:29:05,250
I will finish T.B.K by daybreak.
- Who is T.B.K?

1499
01:29:05,292 --> 01:29:06,458
You are always so hasty!

1500
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,500
That's why so many cases have been
filed against us.

1501
01:29:08,542 --> 01:29:10,042
So we won't get a nomination this time?

1502
01:29:10,208 --> 01:29:12,792
What are you talking about?
I won't get nominated?

1503
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:15,000
I won't be able to contest in the election?

1504
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:16,833
What do you want me to do now?

1505
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:18,542
Wait for ten days.

1506
01:29:18,542 --> 01:29:20,208
Want me to hide like a wuss?

1507
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:21,792
I'm asking you to be smart.

1508
01:29:21,833 --> 01:29:23,625
I wanted to be the Chief Minister�

1509
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:24,583
Look...

1510
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:27,667
The Leader either wants you dead.

1511
01:29:28,042 --> 01:29:33,208
Or file a case and lock you up
if you kill T.B.K.

1512
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:37,958
To avoid these two scenarios,
you must be patient.

1513
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:47,167
I didn't mean it when he said
they'd bury people alive.

1514
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:48,042
But he did!

1515
01:29:48,625 --> 01:29:51,042
He buried three men in three minutes.

1516
01:29:51,167 --> 01:29:51,917
It's over.

1517
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:53,917
I have a question.

1518
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:56,750
When a boy and girl are in love,
what do girls usually ask for?

1519
01:29:56,917 --> 01:29:57,875
"Recharge my phone"

1520
01:29:58,125 --> 01:29:59,750
"Hit 'Like' on my Facebook pictures"

1521
01:29:59,917 --> 01:30:01,792
Or "Buy me clothes at the spring sale"

1522
01:30:02,167 --> 01:30:03,292
But what do you want him to?

1523
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:04,125
Kill someone.

1524
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,458
And he's like a dark Hulk.

1525
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:08,833
HE is supposed to hold him back?

1526
01:30:09,458 --> 01:30:10,250
He will hide.

1527
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:11,583
That's what he'll do.

1528
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:15,875
Look, a boy will do anything
for a girl he loves.

1529
01:30:16,125 --> 01:30:17,542
Does that mean you can ask for anything?

1530
01:30:17,708 --> 01:30:19,708
Is that fair?
Do you have a conscience?

1531
01:30:19,833 --> 01:30:21,875
Are you crazy?
- I look crazy to you?

1532
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:25,792
Tell me this.

1533
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:29,500
Whenever you go home,
you have a mother and family, right?

1534
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,042
They are always there, right?

1535
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:35,292
But when I go home,
there is no one.

1536
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:39,292
You'd understand what I'm saying
only if that happens to you.

1537
01:30:43,167 --> 01:30:46,333
Do you know the last sound
my ears heard?

1538
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:50,000
It was a bomb blast
and my mother screaming.

1539
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:53,750
My dad went somewhere.
But never returned.

1540
01:30:54,833 --> 01:30:57,542
I know the person who caused all this.

1541
01:30:58,708 --> 01:31:00,375
But I'm a girl!

1542
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:04,042
So I should just sit
and cry before his photograph.

1543
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,458
Is that what you're saying?

1544
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:06,875
I can't do that.

1545
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,792
I want to do something to him.

1546
01:31:10,042 --> 01:31:11,292
I want to kill him!
- Kadhambari.

1547
01:31:12,125 --> 01:31:12,708
Don't mind him.

1548
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:13,458
You keep quiet, man.

1549
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:14,792
Trust me.

1550
01:31:15,417 --> 01:31:16,250
I'm there for you.

1551
01:31:16,875 --> 01:31:17,958
We've only just seen him.

1552
01:31:18,667 --> 01:31:20,375
I will plan it properly and
bring him to you.

1553
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:22,542
Trust me, okay?

1554
01:31:27,208 --> 01:31:27,958
Brother!

1555
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
This hand, right?

1556
01:31:29,125 --> 01:31:31,750
I'll break the arm
that betrayed me.

1557
01:31:31,875 --> 01:31:34,458
I'll break your limbs.
- They're lying!

1558
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:37,583
You gave me the child's doll?

1559
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,542
Oh no! I broke a limb.

1560
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:41,000
Get that hand!

1561
01:31:42,042 --> 01:31:43,167
And the head.

1562
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:44,333
The other hand�

1563
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,625
Get it...

1564
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:48,000
Give it to me.

1565
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:50,292
Thank God!
It's okay.

1566
01:31:50,542 --> 01:31:52,292
It's nothing. It's fixed.

1567
01:31:52,542 --> 01:31:54,083
See here?
Take it.

1568
01:31:54,417 --> 01:31:55,958
Daddy was just playing
with your doll.

1569
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,042
I've told you not to use her toys.

1570
01:31:58,875 --> 01:32:01,292
Not in front of the kids.
Take them in.

1571
01:32:01,417 --> 01:32:02,500
Go on.

1572
01:32:03,542 --> 01:32:05,375
No crying, sweetie.

1573
01:32:06,292 --> 01:32:07,208
Wash him out.

1574
01:32:07,792 --> 01:32:09,167
Greetings, Brother.
- Welcome!

1575
01:32:09,417 --> 01:32:10,833
It's been years since I last saw you.

1576
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:11,875
Don't worry.

1577
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:14,625
Just travel with me for a day.
You'll understand everything.

1578
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:15,417
Come on!

1579
01:32:17,125 --> 01:32:19,208
There are three important traits
that make a rowdy:

1580
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:21,708
His gait, wardrobe and attitude.

1581
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:22,875
Gait:

1582
01:32:23,292 --> 01:32:26,125
You should set things aflame
with your walk.

1583
01:32:26,292 --> 01:32:27,208
Next, wardrobe.

1584
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:30,333
When you go to a store,
do you buy shirts and chains like these?

1585
01:32:30,417 --> 01:32:31,250
No, Brother.

1586
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:32,708
Do you know what this is?

1587
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:33,708
What is that?

1588
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:35,250
This is a tattoos.

1589
01:32:35,458 --> 01:32:36,667
This is a beauty!

1590
01:32:37,042 --> 01:32:38,833
This is an important asset to
any rowdy.

1591
01:32:39,625 --> 01:32:40,875
You can hide a weapon in it.

1592
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:42,292
Many will fear you for it.

1593
01:32:42,917 --> 01:32:43,958
Then comes attitude.

1594
01:32:44,583 --> 01:32:45,458
Have you eaten?

1595
01:32:46,792 --> 01:32:47,542
Yes, Brother.

1596
01:32:47,625 --> 01:32:48,958
Now ask me.

1597
01:32:49,375 --> 01:32:50,292
Go on, ask me.

1598
01:32:51,042 --> 01:32:52,333
Have you eaten, Brother?

1599
01:32:53,083 --> 01:32:55,250
You're asking me?
What do I look like?

1600
01:32:55,417 --> 01:32:57,750
Do I look starved?
Like I'm begging you for food..?

1601
01:32:57,792 --> 01:32:58,792
Sorry, Brother.

1602
01:32:59,167 --> 01:33:01,125
I only asked because you told me to.

1603
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:02,667
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

1604
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,708
You got scared?
- I swear I did.

1605
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:07,375
Awesome!

1606
01:33:08,042 --> 01:33:09,458
You should always be haughty.

1607
01:33:09,583 --> 01:33:10,875
And speak in riddles.

1608
01:33:11,333 --> 01:33:12,208
Don't be scared.

1609
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:13,917
I've added a new equipment in this.

1610
01:33:14,042 --> 01:33:15,625
If you fire, there won't be any sound.

1611
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:17,208
Meow! Meow!

1612
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:19,583
You'll only hear a "meow".
I'll show you a demo.

1613
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:30,000
Saw that?

1614
01:33:30,292 --> 01:33:32,375
There are many such equipments.

1615
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:35,417
I will arrange an intelligent gun
for you tomorrow.

1616
01:33:36,167 --> 01:33:36,750
What's this?

1617
01:33:36,875 --> 01:33:37,875
That's the wrong door number.

1618
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,417
Yes, Brother. It's door number 19.

1619
01:33:39,542 --> 01:33:42,208
Moron! We needed door number 9.
- We are at the wrong place.

1620
01:33:42,208 --> 01:33:43,208
Are you stupid?

1621
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:45,042
You should have told me sooner.
So irresponsible.

1622
01:33:45,042 --> 01:33:45,792
You had shot him already.

1623
01:33:45,917 --> 01:33:47,750
What were you thinking?
- You were talking�

1624
01:33:47,958 --> 01:33:49,042
Go away! Get lost.

1625
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:51,208
This is why you should talk
while committing murder.

1626
01:33:51,417 --> 01:33:53,125
Concentration goes for a toss.

1627
01:33:53,292 --> 01:33:55,833
I got confused and shot the wrong guy.

1628
01:33:57,833 --> 01:33:59,125
I'm scared, you go ahead.

1629
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:01,333
I'm right here, bro.
Stand next to me.

1630
01:34:01,458 --> 01:34:02,792
Sir?
- Yes.

1631
01:34:03,208 --> 01:34:04,292
Are you Rajasekar?

1632
01:34:04,458 --> 01:34:04,875
Yeah.

1633
01:34:05,042 --> 01:34:06,500
The advocate?
- Exactly.

1634
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,500
See? This is the man we were looking for.

1635
01:34:10,917 --> 01:34:12,292
No harm in asking him first.

1636
01:34:12,417 --> 01:34:13,750
Sir, please wait.
- Why?

1637
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:17,167
That's all.

1638
01:34:17,292 --> 01:34:21,500
If you're cool and confident,
nothing will go wrong.

1639
01:34:21,833 --> 01:34:24,292
You want to do a big gun now.

1640
01:34:24,667 --> 01:34:26,417
He'd have a small weakness
that makes him weak.

1641
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:28,375
You'd possess some strength and
that makes you strong.

1642
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,042
Use that to
take him by surprise...

1643
01:34:31,208 --> 01:34:34,417
And attack him
by planning a clever "sketch".

1644
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
He is surrounded by problems
from all sides.

1645
01:34:39,167 --> 01:34:41,500
Use that to your advantage.

1646
01:35:13,292 --> 01:35:15,417
Boss is coming to Pondicherry tomorrow.
- Okay!

1647
01:35:15,458 --> 01:35:16,792
Make sure everything is ready.
- Okay, sure.

1648
01:35:16,833 --> 01:35:18,042
I'll go get him now.

1649
01:35:18,042 --> 01:35:19,042
Hey, stay alert.

1650
01:35:19,333 --> 01:35:20,250
I'll leave now.

1651
01:35:40,417 --> 01:35:41,417
Greetings, everybody.

1652
01:35:42,125 --> 01:35:43,458
I have a problem.

1653
01:35:44,292 --> 01:35:47,083
I like to do things for people I like.

1654
01:35:47,792 --> 01:35:48,458
I do.

1655
01:35:48,833 --> 01:35:50,167
I thought you would, too.

1656
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:51,417
My bad.

1657
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,500
I will snatch Killivalavan.

1658
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:58,167
For the ones still interested,
here is my plan.

1659
01:36:00,042 --> 01:36:03,458
Be it a little bird or a lion,
it can't be touched in it's territory.

1660
01:36:04,542 --> 01:36:07,917
We have to lure it into our territory;
Into our comfort zone.

1661
01:36:09,042 --> 01:36:11,833
Killivalavan is a big shot rowdy
in Chennai now.

1662
01:36:12,125 --> 01:36:14,458
But he started off in Pondicherry,
our area.

1663
01:36:15,833 --> 01:36:17,458
The job he left behind still survives.

1664
01:36:17,667 --> 01:36:19,375
He's coming to Pondicherry in two days.

1665
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:22,375
He owns a petrol station in Pondicherry.

1666
01:36:22,417 --> 01:36:25,667
I will smash rotten eggs at his car
while he's here.

1667
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:27,167
One minute, Pandi.

1668
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:28,875
I will smash eggs.

1669
01:36:31,917 --> 01:36:33,042
You smash those eggs...

1670
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:35,875
He will call someone from the station
to wash the car.

1671
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:38,792
I will go disguised as the station guy.
With petrol instead of water.

1672
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:39,292
Nice!

1673
01:36:39,333 --> 01:36:41,958
I will pour petrol all over his
car in the pretext of washing it.

1674
01:36:42,042 --> 01:36:42,667
Okay?

1675
01:36:42,792 --> 01:36:44,750
My friend works in that bunk.

1676
01:36:44,792 --> 01:36:48,875
I will go disguised as the worker
and rub petrol in his car.

1677
01:36:49,542 --> 01:36:51,625
The petrol will dry out in ten minutes.

1678
01:36:51,792 --> 01:36:53,708
I will burn the car before that.

1679
01:36:53,917 --> 01:36:54,625
Pandi.

1680
01:36:55,292 --> 01:36:57,917
He is jobless anyway.
He and I will do that.

1681
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,833
We'll hide and burn it.

1682
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,167
No one will suspect us.

1683
01:37:03,167 --> 01:37:05,333
I understand, Pandi.
Kamakshi and I will do that.

1684
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,625
Killi and his men will scatter away
from the burning car.

1685
01:37:12,042 --> 01:37:15,208
I will hit his men and hold Killi.

1686
01:37:15,875 --> 01:37:18,167
This is a bit risky,
I'll do that on my own.

1687
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:20,917
Pandi, I don't care how many men he has.
I will hit them.

1688
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:23,167
No, Kada. That's too risky.
I'll handle it.

1689
01:37:23,542 --> 01:37:24,083
Pandi...

1690
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:26,250
You don't worry about it.

1691
01:37:26,375 --> 01:37:28,542
No matter how many men there are,
I will hit them.

1692
01:37:29,208 --> 01:37:34,417
When Killivalavan is on his own,
I will hold him at a gunpoint.

1693
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:35,708
Oh no!

1694
01:37:36,333 --> 01:37:38,667
What if you accidentally fire?
I am supposed to stab him.

1695
01:37:39,167 --> 01:37:42,208
I can't fire with that gun.
I can only hold him.

1696
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:45,667
I will hold him back,
you stab him. Okay?

1697
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,167
What's this gun that I've never heard of?

1698
01:37:50,542 --> 01:37:51,333
I'll tell you tomorrow.

1699
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:00,250
Hi.

1700
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,125
Brother asked me to give this to you.

1701
01:38:05,167 --> 01:38:06,083
Which of you is useless?

1702
01:38:06,458 --> 01:38:07,500
Him. Go, man.

1703
01:38:07,917 --> 01:38:10,125
Not in front of Kamakshi!
- He does look useless.

1704
01:38:10,292 --> 01:38:12,542
This is the latest technology.
It's called the net-gun!

1705
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,125
I'll go next.

1706
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:22,792
You'll have to point and focus.

1707
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,458
Shut it.
- Okay.

1708
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:26,958
My turn next, please.

1709
01:38:35,542 --> 01:38:37,542
They were supposed to murder.
And they're playing games.

1710
01:39:02,958 --> 01:39:05,667
I'll give everyone a bluetooth headset.
We shall stay connected.

1711
01:39:05,917 --> 01:39:06,958
Give it to everyone.
- Okay, Pandi

1712
01:39:07,417 --> 01:39:08,708
Does everyone remember the plan?

1713
01:39:09,667 --> 01:39:10,583
Keep everyone posted.

1714
01:39:10,792 --> 01:39:11,208
Okay?

1715
01:39:11,542 --> 01:39:13,208
I am well prepared.

1716
01:39:13,917 --> 01:39:16,417
The bag is too big, though.
How's that?

1717
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:17,792
You've got one. What about us?

1718
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:20,417
I will talk.
- With who?

1719
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:22,458
I'll inform Pandi on what I hear.
- Enough, man!

1720
01:39:22,625 --> 01:39:24,167
You are a rowdy?

1721
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:25,333
Give me one!

1722
01:39:25,542 --> 01:39:27,417
This is a bluetooth earpiece.
Not fancy earrings.

1723
01:39:27,458 --> 01:39:28,500
It's not meant for you.

1724
01:39:29,458 --> 01:39:30,083
Give it to her.

1725
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:32,083
Kadhu, honey. Put it on.

1726
01:39:33,917 --> 01:39:37,042
What does she even need it for?
- Can you hear me?

1727
01:39:37,417 --> 01:39:38,542
Can you hear me speaking?

1728
01:39:38,792 --> 01:39:39,208
I can see it.

1729
01:39:48,458 --> 01:39:50,250
He's at the main road. Get ready.

1730
01:39:50,333 --> 01:39:51,292
I've started!

1731
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:52,500
Get ready, quick.

1732
01:39:53,708 --> 01:39:55,042
Dude, something is fishy.

1733
01:39:56,875 --> 01:39:59,042
That guy is parking his bike
in the middle of the road and sleeping.

1734
01:39:59,083 --> 01:40:00,333
Is he your guy?

1735
01:40:00,542 --> 01:40:02,208
There's a well dressed young lady
running towards him.

1736
01:40:02,292 --> 01:40:03,500
She is lying down, too.

1737
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:05,542
Now there's a third guy!
Triplesome.

1738
01:40:05,667 --> 01:40:07,417
Something is happening.
We should watch out.

1739
01:40:07,833 --> 01:40:09,125
You leave now.
You leave, too.

1740
01:40:24,542 --> 01:40:26,458
See what's wrong.
- Okay, Brother.

1741
01:40:31,333 --> 01:40:32,542
There's been an accident.

1742
01:40:40,417 --> 01:40:41,125
Who is it?

1743
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:42,708
There's a man and a woman.

1744
01:40:43,875 --> 01:40:46,667
Bring the woman into the car.
Run over the man.

1745
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:48,375
Not a great looking woman, Brother.

1746
01:40:48,417 --> 01:40:49,750
Why are you watching it
like it's porn, then?

1747
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,750
Shove them aside.

1748
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:53,958
Son, the car is coming!

1749
01:40:54,167 --> 01:40:55,167
Over.

1750
01:40:55,375 --> 01:40:58,000
Who are you talking to, man?
- No one is coming on line.

1751
01:40:58,042 --> 01:41:00,167
You're just sitting there.
Do something.

1752
01:41:00,333 --> 01:41:01,625
Okay, Pandi.
I'll take care of it.

1753
01:41:02,833 --> 01:41:03,542
Grandpa!

1754
01:41:04,917 --> 01:41:06,458
I told you not to bring the Oldie.

1755
01:41:07,208 --> 01:41:08,667
He's gone!
- Where is he going?

1756
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:12,417
What's happening there?

1757
01:41:12,583 --> 01:41:16,000
You've come to our area
and beat up our men?

1758
01:41:16,125 --> 01:41:17,958
That won't happen while Rahul is alive.

1759
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,542
Who is Rahul?
- I am Rahul.

1760
01:41:19,625 --> 01:41:20,708
Change your name.

1761
01:41:20,750 --> 01:41:21,250
Kill that guy�

1762
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:22,083
Dare to touch me?

1763
01:41:22,125 --> 01:41:23,417
Squash him right there.

1764
01:41:24,542 --> 01:41:26,250
Gramps is a goner. Over.

1765
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:29,167
Gramps! Catch him.

1766
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:30,917
Brother, who is this random guy?

1767
01:41:32,125 --> 01:41:33,125
Here, take this.

1768
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:34,167
Catch him.

1769
01:41:34,625 --> 01:41:35,542
Old guy�

1770
01:41:35,917 --> 01:41:36,750
Gramps got away.

1771
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:37,708
Success!

1772
01:41:38,958 --> 01:41:40,458
Phew! Still on track.

1773
01:41:40,667 --> 01:41:41,333
Hey, stop.

1774
01:41:42,333 --> 01:41:44,083
Who is that old man?

1775
01:41:45,625 --> 01:41:47,625
Why haven't they cremated that corpse?

1776
01:41:47,792 --> 01:41:50,208
Surya, don't screw it up
like gramps did, wait...

1777
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:52,958
Why are you going after him?
Come here.

1778
01:41:53,458 --> 01:41:55,667
Is that whole family crazy?
Why did he come now?

1779
01:41:56,708 --> 01:41:58,417
Did they smash eggs on your car?

1780
01:41:59,208 --> 01:42:00,083
Oh no!

1781
01:42:00,625 --> 01:42:02,000
You're from my fuel station, right?
- Yes.

1782
01:42:02,042 --> 01:42:02,792
Wipe it down.

1783
01:42:02,958 --> 01:42:03,542
Okay, Brother.

1784
01:42:06,875 --> 01:42:08,750
Where are the man and the woman?

1785
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:09,958
Don't know, Brother.

1786
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:11,625
Don't know where they went.

1787
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:13,000
Don't know where they went?

1788
01:42:14,375 --> 01:42:15,750
So mysterious.

1789
01:42:16,958 --> 01:42:19,375
How come he's prepared
to wipe the egg?

1790
01:42:21,833 --> 01:42:23,000
It's over. Over.

1791
01:42:23,167 --> 01:42:24,667
Catch him.
- Wait.

1792
01:42:25,625 --> 01:42:27,667
He's got away.
I can see his head bobbing.

1793
01:42:29,292 --> 01:42:31,000
Something is not right here.

1794
01:42:31,917 --> 01:42:33,417
Get into the car!

1795
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:34,333
Get in, quick.

1796
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:36,875
Bomb!

1797
01:42:36,958 --> 01:42:37,917
It's a bomb.

1798
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:46,708
Why did you bomb?

1799
01:42:49,292 --> 01:42:50,208
Is everything okay?

1800
01:42:55,958 --> 01:42:56,958
Kadhu!

1801
01:42:58,333 --> 01:42:59,958
What happened?
- Are you okay, baby?

1802
01:43:01,583 --> 01:43:02,750
It was a miss!

1803
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:03,833
Call the lorry driver.

1804
01:43:04,125 --> 01:43:05,292
Snatch him!

1805
01:43:06,542 --> 01:43:09,333
T.B.K has the money to buy bombs?

1806
01:43:11,542 --> 01:43:12,958
Pandi, the car hasn't arrived yet.

1807
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:20,375
The lorry guy is coming so fast.
Dip your lights.

1808
01:43:20,375 --> 01:43:22,542
Take those shades off and look properly.
He's coming to run over us!

1809
01:43:22,917 --> 01:43:23,833
Turn this way.

1810
01:43:26,042 --> 01:43:27,417
Why're you going back that way?

1811
01:43:27,458 --> 01:43:28,958
Pandi, the car is here.

1812
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:30,042
Get the matchbox.

1813
01:43:30,542 --> 01:43:31,542
Here...

1814
01:43:35,125 --> 01:43:36,458
What's this?

1815
01:43:37,542 --> 01:43:40,292
There was a bomb blast.
I got scared and confused.

1816
01:43:40,458 --> 01:43:42,167
Pandi. He's screwed up.

1817
01:43:48,292 --> 01:43:49,917
Hold this.
- Give it to me.

1818
01:43:49,958 --> 01:43:50,792
Careful!

1819
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:55,083
Give it to me.

1820
01:43:57,708 --> 01:43:58,208
Careful.

1821
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:00,083
Stand back.
- The car is here.

1822
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:05,792
Come on!

1823
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:06,708
Brother!

1824
01:44:07,292 --> 01:44:09,500
That tyre is aflame.
Let's go, Brother.

1825
01:44:12,458 --> 01:44:13,833
Stop the car now!

1826
01:44:13,917 --> 01:44:15,667
Brother, get down.
Quick.

1827
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:16,417
Quick!

1828
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:21,375
I'll follow him. You get the net gun.

1829
01:44:21,417 --> 01:44:22,208
Okay? Go.

1830
01:44:31,042 --> 01:44:33,708
Makes me happy to watch you run.

1831
01:44:34,875 --> 01:44:36,125
Being cocky?

1832
01:44:36,542 --> 01:44:40,125
I want to shoot you down
just for this cockiness.

1833
01:44:41,833 --> 01:44:42,375
What?

1834
01:44:42,625 --> 01:44:43,208
Answer your phone.

1835
01:44:43,542 --> 01:44:44,792
It's my wife.

1836
01:44:45,458 --> 01:44:46,292
Hello, dear!

1837
01:44:48,167 --> 01:44:50,042
You have gone chasing someone?

1838
01:44:50,167 --> 01:44:53,917
His men are holding a knife
against my and the kids' throats.

1839
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
There's a call waiting?
Answer that.

1840
01:44:57,625 --> 01:44:58,833
Hello.
- T.B.K?

1841
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,458
I was impatient the other day.
Changed my mind.

1842
01:45:02,917 --> 01:45:05,292
Let Baby contest in the election this time.
- I love you, Leader!

1843
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:07,917
You're letting her contest?

1844
01:45:10,667 --> 01:45:13,375
Say one more word about Baby,
and you're dead.

1845
01:45:14,625 --> 01:45:16,917
The Leader knows best.
Hang up now.

1846
01:45:18,667 --> 01:45:21,417
Mansoor, you are an ace villain, alright.

1847
01:45:21,833 --> 01:45:25,083
But right here, right now,
I'm the villain.

1848
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,083
Why do you stress yourself
in this old age?

1849
01:45:29,292 --> 01:45:32,250
KILLI: Why don't you shoot yourself?
PANDI: Where are you?

1850
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:36,042
You are ruining my life.

1851
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:37,208
You shall die.

1852
01:45:37,417 --> 01:45:38,167
Catch him!

1853
01:45:49,375 --> 01:45:52,500
Killi! I am going
to kill you today.

1854
01:45:55,833 --> 01:45:57,000
Come on!

1855
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:59,292
Where the hell are my side kicks?

1856
01:45:59,708 --> 01:46:00,958
Shh! He is right here.

1857
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,167
Hey, Killi!

1858
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:10,458
You've got me trapped in a net?

1859
01:46:10,833 --> 01:46:12,250
I won't let you go.

1860
01:46:12,875 --> 01:46:13,417
Hold this.

1861
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:16,292
It's my loincloth!
Don't do that, it's embarrassing!

1862
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:39,792
Come here!

1863
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Come on, quick!

1864
01:46:42,208 --> 01:46:44,833
Come here! Come here!

1865
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:46,625
My loincloth. Yay!

1866
01:46:47,125 --> 01:46:48,875
Give it to me.

1867
01:46:51,625 --> 01:46:52,208
Where is he?

1868
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:54,333
He looks like anaconda trapped.

1869
01:46:54,542 --> 01:46:56,583
You're some big shot rowdy, huh?

1870
01:46:56,792 --> 01:46:58,417
You have my loincloth.
Where is your face?

1871
01:46:58,458 --> 01:46:59,292
That's his face.

1872
01:46:59,292 --> 01:47:00,500
No, the other way?

1873
01:47:00,542 --> 01:47:01,333
Nuisance!

1874
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:04,250
That's not my face.
It's my wee wee, idiots.

1875
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:05,875
What are you doing?

1876
01:47:05,875 --> 01:47:06,833
I'm drugging you.

1877
01:47:06,917 --> 01:47:10,000
It's so strong!
I'm losing consciousness.

1878
01:47:10,042 --> 01:47:11,417
I know. You will faint!

1879
01:47:11,625 --> 01:47:14,333
What if the drug kills me?
- You're slurring. Die!

1880
01:47:16,958 --> 01:47:18,500
Rahul, watch out.
I'll bring them.

1881
01:47:18,833 --> 01:47:19,542
Stupid!

1882
01:47:23,083 --> 01:47:24,333
Kadhambari!

1883
01:47:24,458 --> 01:47:25,958
You doubted us, right?
Now you'll see.

1884
01:47:26,167 --> 01:47:27,958
He is the man...

1885
01:47:28,042 --> 01:47:28,583
Keep quiet.

1886
01:47:28,667 --> 01:47:30,042
You've got the knife?
Get it.

1887
01:47:30,083 --> 01:47:30,458
Knife..

1888
01:47:30,542 --> 01:47:31,167
She'll do it?

1889
01:47:31,167 --> 01:47:31,875
I have it.

1890
01:47:33,625 --> 01:47:36,375
Remember. Stab him in the chest.
- In the chest.

1891
01:47:36,708 --> 01:47:37,333
Stab him!

1892
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:39,917
His chest. Not elsewhere.

1893
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,042
She knows what to do.

1894
01:47:41,042 --> 01:47:42,042
Okay? Let's go.

1895
01:47:42,083 --> 01:47:42,542
Okay!

1896
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:48,417
But if I stab him in the chest,
he'll die immediately?

1897
01:47:48,458 --> 01:47:49,500
Shall I stab his throat?

1898
01:47:49,583 --> 01:47:51,042
Talk to him.
He'll be bored to death.

1899
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:54,292
So I should stab his chest.
- Just go stab him!

1900
01:47:54,375 --> 01:47:55,667
Let's go!
- I am ready.

1901
01:47:56,125 --> 01:47:56,750
The car!

1902
01:47:57,125 --> 01:47:57,667
Boss!

1903
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:01,542
The car is gone.

1904
01:48:02,875 --> 01:48:04,083
Pandi.
What do we do now?

1905
01:48:04,458 --> 01:48:05,333
My car is gone?

1906
01:48:06,833 --> 01:48:07,625
It's my car.

1907
01:48:13,375 --> 01:48:13,792
Brother.

1908
01:48:13,958 --> 01:48:15,458
What happened to you?
Where did you go?

1909
01:48:15,542 --> 01:48:16,250
We got scared.

1910
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:17,875
Someone kidnapped me!

1911
01:48:17,917 --> 01:48:19,917
I got away somehow.
Find the guy.

1912
01:48:23,708 --> 01:48:24,542
Shut the gates.

1913
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:26,792
It's over.

1914
01:48:27,125 --> 01:48:28,292
My picture is in the car.

1915
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:30,333
They'll know I'm a rowdy.

1916
01:48:35,958 --> 01:48:38,625
He looks like a clown.
He couldn't have kidnapped you.

1917
01:48:38,792 --> 01:48:40,083
It's written all over my face.

1918
01:48:40,458 --> 01:48:41,708
You'll get away.

1919
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,292
But they'd be threatened by me!

1920
01:48:43,917 --> 01:48:44,667
Angel face...

1921
01:48:44,792 --> 01:48:47,125
Don't start off about man, woman,
Anil Kumble and all that...

1922
01:48:48,167 --> 01:48:49,125
Hey, stop.

1923
01:48:49,292 --> 01:48:51,292
What is your problem?
Your grandpa will be back.

1924
01:48:52,125 --> 01:48:53,417
This was all your fault.

1925
01:48:53,542 --> 01:48:55,083
Don't ask him not to cry.
His gramps is missing

1926
01:48:55,083 --> 01:48:57,333
All will be okay. I will handle it.
- How could you say that?

1927
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:00,458
This guy...
- Brother.

1928
01:49:00,542 --> 01:49:01,042
Yes?

1929
01:49:01,042 --> 01:49:02,875
He's come to buy flour in our hood.

1930
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,417
Wait for a day. He will come to us.
I will snatch him then!

1931
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,333
I'll run away then.
You have fun with your lover.

1932
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:09,208
Don't talk to me like that!
- Don't touch me!

1933
01:49:10,375 --> 01:49:11,833
Just shut up, man.

1934
01:49:12,083 --> 01:49:14,333
Kadhambari, everything will be okay.
Trust me this time.

1935
01:49:14,375 --> 01:49:16,208
He will come to us.
I'll snatch him.

1936
01:49:16,292 --> 01:49:17,750
I'll do it this time.
Not like earlier.

1937
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:18,625
Do you trust me?

1938
01:49:19,292 --> 01:49:21,708
Yes, get everyone killed.
Then live happily with her.

1939
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:24,208
Get to hell, man.
- I don't need you.

1940
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:26,708
Don't go out alone.

1941
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:28,542
Listen to me, dude.

1942
01:49:29,208 --> 01:49:30,458
Hey. Dude.

1943
01:49:31,667 --> 01:49:32,708
I'll handle it.

1944
01:49:33,917 --> 01:49:36,333
Listen to me.
Your gramps will be okay.

1945
01:49:36,542 --> 01:49:37,083
Kamakshi!

1946
01:49:37,208 --> 01:49:39,750
I'll take care of everyone.
Trust me.

1947
01:50:12,375 --> 01:50:14,958
Brother, there is a babe at the door.
- See who it is.

1948
01:50:19,583 --> 01:50:21,375
Who are you? What is it?
- Look, I give up.

1949
01:50:21,458 --> 01:50:23,792
You're all big shots.
We can't do anything to you.

1950
01:50:23,875 --> 01:50:24,625
We tried and failed.

1951
01:50:25,167 --> 01:50:27,083
Do anything you want.
- What?

1952
01:50:27,417 --> 01:50:29,708
Do anything you want,
no problem.

1953
01:50:30,708 --> 01:50:35,375
Either he dies, or I die.
One way or the other, this ends today.

1954
01:50:36,042 --> 01:50:36,708
Go to him...

1955
01:50:41,958 --> 01:50:43,292
Brother.
- What?

1956
01:50:43,958 --> 01:50:48,667
A really hot girl has come here.
And she says "You can do anything".

1957
01:50:49,958 --> 01:50:52,125
What are you saying?
- I swear.

1958
01:50:52,458 --> 01:50:53,875
She said "You can do anything"?
- Yeah.

1959
01:50:54,375 --> 01:50:55,750
She actually said that?
- Yeah.

1960
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:58,750
I didn't call anyone.

1961
01:51:02,542 --> 01:51:03,375
Do one thing.

1962
01:51:03,917 --> 01:51:06,500
Take a selfie and WhatsApp it to me.
- Okay, Brother.

1963
01:51:06,792 --> 01:51:08,708
Take a full shot and send it.
- A full shot. Okay.

1964
01:51:09,833 --> 01:51:10,958
Hey.
- Yes?

1965
01:51:12,167 --> 01:51:14,167
Does Baby know that I'm here?
- Don't know, Brother.

1966
01:51:16,375 --> 01:51:18,958
Brother wanted your picture.
Can I click one?

1967
01:51:19,333 --> 01:51:19,958
Take it.

1968
01:51:23,667 --> 01:51:25,458
She's worth millions, dude.

1969
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:26,167
Show me.

1970
01:51:27,083 --> 01:51:27,833
No peeping.

1971
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:29,417
Ask her to come.

1972
01:51:29,458 --> 01:51:30,833
This is very exciting...

1973
01:51:31,208 --> 01:51:33,125
Tidy up the place.
Bring my perfume!

1974
01:52:09,417 --> 01:52:10,208
Get out.

1975
01:52:10,583 --> 01:52:11,167
All body.

1976
01:52:22,333 --> 01:52:23,917
What is the matter?
Tell me.

1977
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:25,458
I want�

1978
01:52:25,833 --> 01:52:26,500
You want?

1979
01:52:30,667 --> 01:52:31,750
I want to do you, sir.

1980
01:52:34,542 --> 01:52:35,958
You want to what?

1981
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:38,958
I want to do you, sir.

1982
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,458
I just have to do this.

1983
01:52:44,167 --> 01:52:45,417
Go away, rascal.

1984
01:52:48,208 --> 01:52:49,000
Well...

1985
01:52:49,625 --> 01:52:50,125
Why?

1986
01:52:51,292 --> 01:52:52,250
That...

1987
01:52:52,917 --> 01:52:54,167
Why is that?

1988
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:58,458
Ever since childhood�

1989
01:53:01,542 --> 01:53:04,000
This is the one thing my dad wanted.

1990
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:06,417
Damn.

1991
01:53:07,167 --> 01:53:09,542
I had no idea I was sought after.

1992
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:13,375
I'd been rattling that tin box called Baby.

1993
01:53:13,667 --> 01:53:16,083
I want to stab you to death.

1994
01:53:17,792 --> 01:53:18,333
Okay.

1995
01:53:19,583 --> 01:53:20,958
I don't mind

1996
01:53:21,542 --> 01:53:22,542
Let's do it.

1997
01:53:23,125 --> 01:53:24,042
How can we not?
- Brother.

1998
01:53:24,250 --> 01:53:25,333
What is it now?

1999
01:53:25,542 --> 01:53:26,750
Our location has been revealed.

2000
01:53:28,708 --> 01:53:30,500
He will send at least fifty to sixty men.

2001
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,083
Are you sure of the information?

2002
01:53:32,417 --> 01:53:33,792
It's confirmed, Brother.
We know.

2003
01:53:34,333 --> 01:53:36,500
How many of our men are here?
- Hardly ten.

2004
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:53,167
Wait for me.

2005
01:53:53,583 --> 01:53:55,167
You interrupted a fine moment.

2006
01:53:55,667 --> 01:53:56,917
Why are you guys torturing me?

2007
01:53:57,542 --> 01:53:59,375
You're all killing me!

2008
01:54:07,583 --> 01:54:09,250
Sorry for the interval.

2009
01:54:12,125 --> 01:54:14,458
Forget it. Let's talk.

2010
01:54:16,667 --> 01:54:17,625
It's not my phone.

2011
01:54:18,875 --> 01:54:19,708
Your phone is ringing.

2012
01:54:21,917 --> 01:54:22,583
What happened, Pandi?

2013
01:54:22,958 --> 01:54:24,042
Where is mom?
- She's not here.

2014
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:25,917
Not here?
- She didn't come in today.

2015
01:54:26,625 --> 01:54:28,417
She's not at home either.
- She didn't come to work.

2016
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:29,958
Know where she's gone?
- No, Pandi.

2017
01:54:34,292 --> 01:54:35,500
Your phone.

2018
01:54:46,208 --> 01:54:46,958
Talk.

2019
01:54:49,792 --> 01:54:50,292
Brother.

2020
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:52,667
What?
- Come here.

2021
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:54,958
Don't take this away from me.

2022
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,750
I don't care how many of their men come.
Or how many of our men die.

2023
01:54:58,792 --> 01:54:59,917
Don't come upstairs.

2024
01:55:00,042 --> 01:55:01,333
I don't want to be disturbed.

2025
01:55:01,375 --> 01:55:02,167
He's yelling!

2026
01:55:02,208 --> 01:55:04,375
Tell him I'll stab anyone who interrupts.

2027
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:06,000
Bring everyone.

2028
01:55:07,667 --> 01:55:08,958
Hello!

2029
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:10,958
Kadhambari!

2030
01:55:11,042 --> 01:55:12,375
Can you... well...

2031
01:55:12,542 --> 01:55:14,500
Pass the phone to someone
next to you.

2032
01:55:14,958 --> 01:55:16,292
Kadhambari. Please...
- Pandi...

2033
01:55:16,875 --> 01:55:19,542
I don't know if you're yelling...
...or crying...

2034
01:55:19,583 --> 01:55:22,458
I can't hear what you're saying.

2035
01:55:22,792 --> 01:55:24,875
But hear me out.

2036
01:55:25,417 --> 01:55:30,167
I'm sorry for troubling you and your friends.

2037
01:55:32,167 --> 01:55:33,708
Don't look for me, Pandi.

2038
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:38,208
There's no point.
- Don't be silly.

2039
01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:39,750
Hand the phone to someone.
Don't do something stupid!

2040
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:41,125
I'll take care of myself.

2041
01:55:41,167 --> 01:55:42,417
Is someone there?
Hello?

2042
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:44,042
Kadhambari?
Hello?

2043
01:55:57,917 --> 01:55:59,250
Go away.
- Have you left?

2044
01:56:01,333 --> 01:56:04,500
Kill every last one of them.
- Okay, Brother.

2045
01:56:04,583 --> 01:56:07,875
Don't disturb me for half an hour.
- Have fun, Brother.

2046
01:56:10,125 --> 01:56:13,083
You're quiet when you're sitting
and hot while standing.

2047
01:56:14,292 --> 01:56:15,292
I sent everyone away.

2048
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,083
Just you and me now.

2049
01:56:18,042 --> 01:56:19,042
You can do�

2050
01:56:25,083 --> 01:56:26,708
This is what you meant by "doing"?

2051
01:56:28,083 --> 01:56:31,833
I had my doubts.
You're too hot for me.

2052
01:56:32,167 --> 01:56:33,875
Baby, I'm sorry, Baby!

2053
01:56:44,708 --> 01:56:45,667
Don't get hurt.

2054
01:56:46,083 --> 01:56:46,958
Carefiul, Brother!

2055
01:56:47,042 --> 01:56:48,083
Who is she?

2056
01:56:48,208 --> 01:56:49,083
Tell me, Brother.

2057
01:56:49,125 --> 01:56:49,917
Get lost.

2058
01:56:49,958 --> 01:56:50,917
Tell me, Brother.

2059
01:56:51,042 --> 01:56:52,250
I said, get lost.

2060
01:57:00,167 --> 01:57:01,458
Chop her to pieces.

2061
01:57:01,667 --> 01:57:02,958
Adding to my troubles�

2062
01:57:04,833 --> 01:57:05,708
Wait.

2063
01:57:06,833 --> 01:57:08,042
Lock her up inside.

2064
01:57:08,375 --> 01:57:09,708
Shouldn't let this go to waste.

2065
01:57:26,375 --> 01:57:27,542
Hello?

2066
01:57:27,833 --> 01:57:28,542
Kadhambari?

2067
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:30,750
Is anyone there?

2068
01:57:34,833 --> 01:57:36,292
I'm here. Who is this?

2069
01:57:36,458 --> 01:57:36,833
Thanks, sir.

2070
01:57:36,917 --> 01:57:40,167
That girl is trying to stab this guy
called Killivalavan.

2071
01:57:40,250 --> 01:57:41,583
He's a mediocre rowdy in the hood.

2072
01:57:41,792 --> 01:57:46,208
Tell her I'll chop him into little bits
and gift her the pieces.

2073
01:57:46,292 --> 01:57:48,583
Tell her that.

2074
01:57:48,625 --> 01:57:51,000
Can you repeat that?

2075
01:57:53,208 --> 01:57:54,708
That girl is hearing disabled, sir.

2076
01:57:54,750 --> 01:57:56,458
She's trying to murder this guy
called Killivallavan.

2077
01:57:56,542 --> 01:57:58,750
Tell her that I'm so pissed off�

2078
01:57:58,875 --> 01:58:02,125
I'll chop him into little bits
and gift her the pieces.

2079
01:58:03,042 --> 01:58:05,792
I don't know how to tell her that.
Where are you now?

2080
01:58:05,833 --> 01:58:07,583
Just tell me where to come.
I'll be there.

2081
01:58:08,542 --> 01:58:11,958
Let's do this.
I'll send a guy to you�

2082
01:58:12,375 --> 01:58:13,417
He'll bring you here.

2083
01:58:13,458 --> 01:58:15,667
You can tell her that yourself.
- Okay, sir. Thanks.

2084
01:58:15,708 --> 01:58:17,708
Please take care of the girl.
I'll be there.

2085
01:58:17,875 --> 01:58:19,125
Okay? Please, take care.
- Okay.

2086
01:58:21,667 --> 01:58:22,917
Who is this guy?

2087
01:58:23,208 --> 01:58:25,500
Find out. Bring him to me.

2088
01:58:25,917 --> 01:58:27,250
What's all this?

2089
01:58:28,417 --> 01:58:30,917
One chick comes to seduce me.
Then this guy calls up.

2090
01:58:31,083 --> 01:58:32,958
What are you goons here for?

2091
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:35,625
Go! Do your job.

2092
01:58:37,833 --> 01:58:40,958
She can help cool me down�

2093
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:45,708
Greetings.

2094
01:58:46,333 --> 01:58:47,500
Oh! Good morning.

2095
01:58:50,125 --> 01:58:50,583
Come.

2096
01:58:50,958 --> 01:58:53,333
Sir... Kadhambari... phone...

2097
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,708
Can you repeat that?

2098
01:58:58,375 --> 01:59:00,542
I was just joking around, sir.

2099
01:59:00,583 --> 01:59:02,417
She can't hear,
so I was passing a message.

2100
01:59:02,417 --> 01:59:03,917
I didn't hear the joke.

2101
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:05,292
Can you repeat it?

2102
01:59:05,917 --> 01:59:08,417
I'm sorry�
- Just repeat what you said.

2103
01:59:10,042 --> 01:59:10,792
Tell him.

2104
01:59:12,750 --> 01:59:14,750
I'm a little pissed�

2105
01:59:15,792 --> 01:59:17,917
So if I find the honourable Mr. Killivalavan�

2106
01:59:18,708 --> 01:59:20,208
You weren't so respectful.

2107
01:59:20,667 --> 01:59:24,250
You were so cocky and stylish.
Say it like that again.

2108
01:59:24,333 --> 01:59:27,208
Sir, I'm sorry.
Let us go.

2109
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:29,000
Say it.
You want to do what?

2110
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:37,000
I'm so pissed off now,
if I find Killivalavan�

2111
01:59:38,583 --> 01:59:39,708
I will beat him�

2112
01:59:44,542 --> 01:59:46,750
He hit me while I was talking!

2113
01:59:46,833 --> 01:59:50,083
Say it now
or I will hit you.

2114
01:59:50,542 --> 01:59:51,042
Say it.

2115
01:59:52,917 --> 01:59:54,125
Speak out.

2116
01:59:57,708 --> 02:00:02,708
I'm so pissed off now,
if I find Killivalavan�

2117
02:00:03,458 --> 02:00:04,542
I will beat him�

2118
02:00:11,667 --> 02:00:13,208
Ask him not to hit me in the head.

2119
02:00:13,292 --> 02:00:14,167
I'm feeling woozy.

2120
02:00:15,417 --> 02:00:17,042
Not so soft. I said harder.

2121
02:00:37,542 --> 02:00:39,083
What you glaring at?

2122
02:00:40,333 --> 02:00:42,292
Not glaring. Just looking.

2123
02:00:42,583 --> 02:00:43,833
Just looking?

2124
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:46,375
What did you do to the girl?

2125
02:00:46,417 --> 02:00:48,083
Let her go, poor thing.

2126
02:00:48,208 --> 02:00:49,458
Do whatever you want to me.

2127
02:00:49,542 --> 02:00:51,042
What could I do with you?

2128
02:00:57,917 --> 02:00:59,000
Let the girl go, sir.

2129
02:00:59,375 --> 02:01:00,458
Poor thing.

2130
02:01:00,542 --> 02:01:01,792
Do whatever you want to me.

2131
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,042
Let the girl go!

2132
02:01:10,542 --> 02:01:11,292
Let the girl go.

2133
02:01:35,333 --> 02:01:38,000
Kadhambari!

2134
02:01:40,708 --> 02:01:41,292
Oh no�

2135
02:01:42,583 --> 02:01:43,792
Is she gone?

2136
02:01:44,417 --> 02:01:46,333
Have they killed you too?

2137
02:01:50,167 --> 02:01:52,458
I told you not to go�

2138
02:01:52,917 --> 02:01:53,833
Kadhambari!

2139
02:01:55,583 --> 02:01:56,833
Why did you do this?

2140
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:05,750
Kadhambari!

2141
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:09,833
I'm okay.

2142
02:02:10,042 --> 02:02:11,500
I'm just hiding here.

2143
02:02:13,542 --> 02:02:14,042
Pandi.

2144
02:02:14,167 --> 02:02:17,458
Don't worry. I'm here now.
Everything will be okay.

2145
02:02:17,958 --> 02:02:19,583
We'll plan and kill him.

2146
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:24,375
No, Pandi. Just go away.
- I've planned everything perfectly.

2147
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,292
Okay, it's okay.

2148
02:02:27,333 --> 02:02:28,417
Don't be scared.

2149
02:02:28,542 --> 02:02:29,875
I'll take a look
and be right back.

2150
02:02:30,458 --> 02:02:31,625
Go away, Pandi.

2151
02:02:32,458 --> 02:02:34,167
Hide here, okay?

2152
02:02:40,333 --> 02:02:41,958
Pandi, don't.

2153
02:02:48,333 --> 02:02:49,750
You go away, Brother.

2154
02:02:50,167 --> 02:02:51,708
I'll make sure no one comes up.

2155
02:02:51,833 --> 02:02:53,250
Go away, Brother.

2156
02:02:56,375 --> 02:02:57,167
Excuse me!

2157
02:03:02,875 --> 02:03:05,167
Watch the door.
- I will, Brother.

2158
02:03:10,583 --> 02:03:13,708
No one should come upstairs.
Everybody, go down.

2159
02:03:14,125 --> 02:03:14,708
Who is..?

2160
02:03:29,417 --> 02:03:30,625
What are you looking at?

2161
02:03:33,583 --> 02:03:34,208
Not looking.

2162
02:03:34,833 --> 02:03:35,417
Then?

2163
02:03:39,667 --> 02:03:40,458
I'm glaring.

2164
02:03:42,833 --> 02:03:44,417
Come closer and glare at me.

2165
02:04:30,458 --> 02:04:31,292
Catch him.

2166
02:04:31,542 --> 02:04:32,583
Kill that guy!

2167
02:04:52,667 --> 02:04:53,917
Come!

2168
02:04:55,083 --> 02:04:56,667
Come on, come on.

2169
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:07,625
Come on!

2170
02:05:10,792 --> 02:05:12,250
I will kill you all.

2171
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,875
Brother.

2172
02:05:16,250 --> 02:05:17,667
What?
- Another ten men are here.

2173
02:05:17,750 --> 02:05:19,375
Twenty more
on their way...

2174
02:05:20,458 --> 02:05:23,542
All our men are dead.
Listen to me. Run away!

2175
02:05:23,667 --> 02:05:25,417
Let that guy go.
Go down.

2176
02:05:26,292 --> 02:05:27,375
I will go.

2177
02:05:27,417 --> 02:05:28,250
Just go.

2178
02:05:28,333 --> 02:05:29,417
Go down, now.
- I'm going, Brother.

2179
02:05:55,917 --> 02:05:58,875
I told you not to come after me.
I'd have minded my life.

2180
02:05:58,917 --> 02:05:59,958
Why did you..?
- Slap you!

2181
02:06:00,208 --> 02:06:00,875
What?

2182
02:06:01,375 --> 02:06:02,625
You just went away.

2183
02:06:03,708 --> 02:06:07,167
You thought I was kidding?
That I'd just let you go?

2184
02:06:07,292 --> 02:06:08,083
I will come for you.

2185
02:06:08,750 --> 02:06:09,583
I will look for you.

2186
02:06:13,250 --> 02:06:14,125
Fool!

2187
02:06:14,625 --> 02:06:15,375
You're killing me.

2188
02:06:16,292 --> 02:06:17,250
Crazy woman.

2189
02:06:19,833 --> 02:06:21,167
I told you not to come.

2190
02:06:21,208 --> 02:06:22,667
Sit!

2191
02:06:27,125 --> 02:06:28,708
Tell me.
- Where are you?

2192
02:06:29,042 --> 02:06:30,375
I'm with Kadhambari.

2193
02:06:30,417 --> 02:06:31,583
They've snatched your mother.

2194
02:06:31,833 --> 02:06:32,583
What are you saying?

2195
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,333
Yes. They've snatched your mom.

2196
02:06:34,458 --> 02:06:37,417
We should go look for you mum,
just like we looked for her dad.

2197
02:06:38,208 --> 02:06:39,583
You went after the girl.

2198
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:41,417
Now when you come back,
none of us would be alive.

2199
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:42,333
Just go.

2200
02:06:54,250 --> 02:06:55,042
Mummy!

2201
02:06:58,750 --> 02:06:59,333
Pandi�

2202
02:07:03,167 --> 02:07:04,375
Pandi, what happened?

2203
02:07:08,208 --> 02:07:09,542
Pandi, what happened?

2204
02:07:10,042 --> 02:07:11,167
Tell me.

2205
02:07:11,333 --> 02:07:12,125
It's nothing.

2206
02:07:13,458 --> 02:07:14,750
Just wait and see.

2207
02:07:15,917 --> 02:07:19,750
I'M SO PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW,
I WILL CHOP KILLIVALLAVAN INTO BITS...

2208
02:07:19,792 --> 02:07:21,750
� AND GIFT HIM TO YOU,
KADHAMBARI!

2209
02:07:24,917 --> 02:07:28,292
This guy.
Still repeating the same dialogue?

2210
02:07:32,958 --> 02:07:33,792
Is it him?
- Yes.

2211
02:07:37,875 --> 02:07:39,125
There's a riot downstairs.

2212
02:07:39,375 --> 02:07:41,875
I'm hiding this way for the first time
in my whole life.

2213
02:07:41,917 --> 02:07:43,875
You don't know how embarrassing this is.

2214
02:07:46,375 --> 02:07:47,417
What is your problem, Miss?

2215
02:07:47,458 --> 02:07:50,292
Boy, at least you tell me?
What's your problem.

2216
02:07:50,708 --> 02:07:52,542
You got the wrong address?

2217
02:07:52,833 --> 02:07:54,250
I have never seen you before.

2218
02:07:54,583 --> 02:07:56,375
You're fighting for no reason.

2219
02:07:57,500 --> 02:07:59,333
Be quiet till I tell you.

2220
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:01,625
What is it?

2221
02:08:02,375 --> 02:08:04,750
Her dad was a cop.
You were a rowdy back then.

2222
02:08:04,792 --> 02:08:08,000
You had a fight, so you gifted a bomb
at their home.

2223
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:11,208
Her mother died at the blast and
this girl lost her hearing.

2224
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:13,083
So her dad came for revenge.

2225
02:08:13,250 --> 02:08:15,167
Wasn't he right in doing that?
That's the correct emotion?

2226
02:08:15,292 --> 02:08:16,875
But you didn't co-operate.
You killed him, too.

2227
02:08:16,958 --> 02:08:18,208
This girl is a poor orphan now.

2228
02:08:18,583 --> 02:08:20,125
Then she and I fell in love.

2229
02:08:20,292 --> 02:08:22,792
So when we were about to kiss�

2230
02:08:22,833 --> 02:08:24,125
The girl tells me�

2231
02:08:25,458 --> 02:08:27,583
No� you gotta kill him first.

2232
02:08:27,625 --> 02:08:29,417
We can kiss only then.

2233
02:08:29,542 --> 02:08:31,167
What would you do?
You would kill, right?

2234
02:08:31,208 --> 02:08:32,625
That's why I tried to kill you twice.

2235
02:08:32,667 --> 02:08:34,417
Please co-operate.
- Just stop!

2236
02:08:35,458 --> 02:08:38,583
I did that out of anger.
I'm sorry.

2237
02:08:39,417 --> 02:08:40,125
Sorry!

2238
02:08:41,042 --> 02:08:42,708
I'm angry now, too.

2239
02:08:42,958 --> 02:08:46,500
But to wash away my sins,
I'm letting you both go.

2240
02:08:46,625 --> 02:08:47,458
Just run.

2241
02:08:49,542 --> 02:08:50,917
How do we kill him without a knife?

2242
02:08:50,958 --> 02:08:54,083
No time to sit and think now.
There must be booze bottles lying�

2243
02:08:54,375 --> 02:08:55,583
What would I do with it?

2244
02:09:00,417 --> 02:09:03,042
I'm letting you go even though
you hit me back.

2245
02:09:03,083 --> 02:09:04,875
What are you mumbling about?

2246
02:09:05,958 --> 02:09:07,708
Please understand my problem.

2247
02:09:07,792 --> 02:09:09,708
Look, you go to that room.

2248
02:09:09,958 --> 02:09:12,750
That's your room and this is mine.
Let's not bother each other.

2249
02:09:13,042 --> 02:09:14,750
When everything is sorted downstairs�

2250
02:09:14,792 --> 02:09:17,667
We will go our separate ways
and live our lives.

2251
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:18,208
Get it?

2252
02:09:18,333 --> 02:09:20,750
Get out of here, anyway.

2253
02:09:23,917 --> 02:09:24,917
Kadhambari, I'm holding him.

2254
02:09:25,042 --> 02:09:25,917
Come on.

2255
02:09:26,042 --> 02:09:26,917
Find something. Look around.

2256
02:09:26,958 --> 02:09:29,250
Let go of me.
You can't do a thing.

2257
02:09:29,292 --> 02:09:31,000
You don't know how strong I am.

2258
02:09:31,125 --> 02:09:32,375
Get that pipe!

2259
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:34,000
Listen to me, boy.

2260
02:09:34,125 --> 02:09:35,583
You're testing my patience.

2261
02:09:35,708 --> 02:09:36,875
Quick, quick, quick!

2262
02:09:36,958 --> 02:09:38,500
Quickly, Kadhambari!

2263
02:09:39,667 --> 02:09:40,958
What is your girlfriend doing?

2264
02:09:41,042 --> 02:09:41,833
Break that.

2265
02:09:42,083 --> 02:09:42,958
Careful.

2266
02:09:43,042 --> 02:09:43,958
Grab a sharp piece.

2267
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,083
Take it.

2268
02:09:45,208 --> 02:09:46,625
Come, Kadhambari.
- Let me go!

2269
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:48,708
Get a sharp piece.

2270
02:09:48,792 --> 02:09:50,833
Don't be afraid.

2271
02:09:51,083 --> 02:09:52,333
Don't shout, you'll confuse her.

2272
02:09:52,375 --> 02:09:53,792
Come on, Kadhambari.

2273
02:09:55,250 --> 02:09:56,875
You can do it.
Come on!

2274
02:09:56,958 --> 02:09:58,542
Come on.

2275
02:10:01,708 --> 02:10:02,292
Stab him.

2276
02:10:06,042 --> 02:10:06,792
Fool!

2277
02:10:06,917 --> 02:10:08,458
Don't be afraid.

2278
02:10:08,542 --> 02:10:10,458
Don't close your eyes.
You can't hear then.

2279
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:12,958
PANDI :Kadhambari, are you ready?
KILLI : Put it down.

2280
02:10:13,250 --> 02:10:14,250
Shut up, sir.

2281
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:16,917
Kadhu dear, do it.

2282
02:10:19,875 --> 02:10:21,125
Stab him!

2283
02:10:21,625 --> 02:10:22,708
Stab him!

2284
02:10:30,708 --> 02:10:31,500
Kadhu�

2285
02:10:32,250 --> 02:10:36,292
Why did you kill my dad?
You could have let him go.

2286
02:10:38,083 --> 02:10:39,250
Why did you do it?

2287
02:10:41,292 --> 02:10:43,333
I can't hear.

2288
02:10:44,208 --> 02:10:46,667
But I can hear you screaming.

2289
02:10:48,708 --> 02:10:49,542
Let go, Pandi.

2290
02:10:49,833 --> 02:10:51,083
I won't kill you.

2291
02:10:51,708 --> 02:10:53,417
But you will die.

2292
02:10:54,333 --> 02:10:55,542
Let's go, Pandi.

2293
02:10:55,792 --> 02:10:57,708
Someone will kill him for sure.
- Kadhu�

2294
02:10:58,500 --> 02:10:59,292
Let's go, Pandi.

2295
02:10:59,375 --> 02:11:02,375
Kadhambari, don't go!

2296
02:11:02,667 --> 02:11:05,000
She's walking away.
What is your problem, man?

2297
02:11:05,083 --> 02:11:08,500
Listen. You too should walk away,
or I'll bury both of you.

2298
02:11:10,125 --> 02:11:11,875
Killi, you son of a gun!

2299
02:11:14,542 --> 02:11:16,042
You're done for.

2300
02:11:17,708 --> 02:11:19,583
You became a politician by pimping!

2301
02:11:22,125 --> 02:11:24,958
Listen to me...
-Sir, I can't let you go!

2302
02:11:26,250 --> 02:11:28,833
I told you. I told you to go.

2303
02:11:29,083 --> 02:11:30,833
I told you to go.

2304
02:11:33,667 --> 02:11:34,583
You..!

2305
02:11:37,458 --> 02:11:38,042
Come on...

2306
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,708
Hiding in the toilet?

2307
02:11:43,792 --> 02:11:45,083
Come on!

2308
02:11:46,417 --> 02:11:47,208
Do it.

2309
02:11:47,375 --> 02:11:48,375
Who are you, son?

2310
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:49,542
I came to kill him, too.

2311
02:11:49,583 --> 02:11:50,583
You stay right there.

2312
02:11:50,667 --> 02:11:51,542
Come on, kill him.

2313
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,125
My knife is going to see action, today.

2314
02:11:55,250 --> 02:11:57,833
Run away. Or I will chop you to bits.

2315
02:11:58,292 --> 02:11:59,292
Kill him.

2316
02:11:59,500 --> 02:12:00,250
Come for me.

2317
02:12:00,375 --> 02:12:01,417
You stay there!

2318
02:12:01,667 --> 02:12:02,875
Who are you to kill?

2319
02:12:39,542 --> 02:12:41,417
Taking up a knife doesn't make you a rowdy.

2320
02:12:42,208 --> 02:12:44,083
The knife should take up to you.

2321
02:12:44,708 --> 02:12:45,917
That's an original rowdy.

2322
02:12:47,542 --> 02:12:50,333
The knife seems to like you.

2323
02:12:52,208 --> 02:12:54,125
You're doing everything for a girl.

2324
02:12:56,167 --> 02:12:56,792
Do it.

2325
02:12:57,917 --> 02:12:58,417
Do it!

2326
02:13:20,083 --> 02:13:20,958
Kadhu�

2327
02:13:34,125 --> 02:13:34,917
Come.

2328
02:13:39,375 --> 02:13:40,292
Look inside.

2329
02:13:49,375 --> 02:13:50,958
Both of them are dead.

2330
02:13:52,292 --> 02:13:53,708
You made me kill two men.

2331
02:13:54,667 --> 02:13:55,458
It's okay.

2332
02:13:56,292 --> 02:13:57,583
That's the life of a rowdy.

2333
02:13:57,917 --> 02:13:59,833
Can't keep count of the dead.

2334
02:14:09,083 --> 02:14:09,708
Kadhu...

2335
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:15,667
You wanted a great rowdy.
Do you concede now?

2336
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:21,917
Are you okay, baby?

2337
02:14:23,083 --> 02:14:23,583
Sure?

2338
02:14:25,292 --> 02:14:26,250
Let's leave?

2339
02:14:46,083 --> 02:14:47,083
You're bleeding!

2340
02:14:47,292 --> 02:14:48,375
Blood all over..

2341
02:14:48,875 --> 02:14:49,917
Come on�

2342
02:14:50,375 --> 02:14:51,208
I'm here.

2343
02:14:51,333 --> 02:14:52,208
Hold on.

2344
02:14:52,708 --> 02:14:54,167
Take this knife.
- Give it to me.

2345
02:14:56,333 --> 02:14:57,333
Go inside.

2346
02:14:57,583 --> 02:14:59,292
Everything will fall in place.
- Really?

2347
02:15:00,958 --> 02:15:01,708
Can I hug?

2348
02:15:02,208 --> 02:15:04,250
No. Control your emotions.

2349
02:15:04,833 --> 02:15:05,375
Miss�

2350
02:15:05,958 --> 02:15:08,208
She doesn't understand my feelings.
Get her a hearing aid.

2351
02:15:08,583 --> 02:15:09,125
You go.

2352
02:15:09,958 --> 02:15:10,958
You leave, son.

2353
02:15:11,292 --> 02:15:12,792
Go, I'll handle it.

2354
02:15:13,083 --> 02:15:14,083
Just go.
I'll handle it.

2355
02:15:14,333 --> 02:15:15,083
I'm here now.

2356
02:15:16,167 --> 02:15:17,792
You don't know about me.

2357
02:15:18,083 --> 02:15:20,167
You're lying down here?

2358
02:15:20,417 --> 02:15:22,458
Oh my god. They're dead?

2359
02:15:22,625 --> 02:15:24,292
There are corpses inside.

2360
02:15:25,167 --> 02:15:26,000
Have you left?

2361
02:15:27,083 --> 02:15:29,667
This is the knife used to kill?
You're giving it for my finger prints?

2362
02:15:29,750 --> 02:15:30,458
I don't understand.

2363
02:15:32,250 --> 02:15:33,708
Let's talk it out...

2364
02:15:46,042 --> 02:15:46,875
Boy!

2365
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:47,458
Mummy.

2366
02:15:47,542 --> 02:15:48,917
Remember your promise?

2367
02:15:48,958 --> 02:15:52,583
That you'll marry the girl I pick for you.

2368
02:15:52,625 --> 02:15:54,833
Everyone else is like your sister.

2369
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:01,250
Did you see my son?
Such a gem of a boy.

2370
02:16:09,708 --> 02:16:10,417
Mummy!

2371
02:16:12,083 --> 02:16:12,708
Mummy!

2372
02:16:13,458 --> 02:16:15,792
I let you down, Mummy.

2373
02:16:18,583 --> 02:16:20,417
She is a really nice girl.

2374
02:16:20,958 --> 02:16:22,375
Just like you...

2375
02:16:23,375 --> 02:16:26,375
I didn't even thing about you.

2376
02:16:27,250 --> 02:16:28,833
Mummy, I am starving.

2377
02:16:29,292 --> 02:16:31,292
Who will cook for me now?

2378
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:32,208
Mummy!

2379
02:16:35,083 --> 02:16:35,750
Mummy?

2380
02:16:45,416 --> 02:16:47,583
Who is going to feed me now?

2381
02:16:55,708 --> 02:16:58,000
Even after dying,
you make the best gravy.

2382
02:16:58,166 --> 02:16:58,625
Boy!

2383
02:16:59,041 --> 02:17:01,666
I'll slap you if you don't
stop blabbering.

2384
02:17:02,375 --> 02:17:04,583
It's last night's gravy.
I've heated it up.

2385
02:17:08,708 --> 02:17:10,166
Show me your legs.

2386
02:17:10,291 --> 02:17:11,666
What is up with you?

2387
02:17:11,791 --> 02:17:13,083
You're okay?

2388
02:17:16,291 --> 02:17:19,000
He said they've snatched you.

2389
02:17:19,083 --> 02:17:21,750
It scared me and I've been crying.
- No such thing...

2390
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,375
Why are you crying now?

2391
02:17:23,458 --> 02:17:24,833
Your phone was unreachable too...

2392
02:17:24,875 --> 02:17:27,250
I had gone to the Head Office
to talk about your job posting.

2393
02:17:27,291 --> 02:17:28,583
My phone ran out of battery.

2394
02:17:29,125 --> 02:17:30,625
My gem of a boy...

2395
02:17:31,041 --> 02:17:31,916
Has become a cop!

2396
02:17:33,041 --> 02:17:34,916
I've dreamt about this for years.

2397
02:17:35,166 --> 02:17:37,291
Phew!
You're a cop now.

2398
02:17:37,541 --> 02:17:38,208
That's enough.

2399
02:17:38,291 --> 02:17:38,916
Police?

2400
02:17:39,708 --> 02:17:40,791
Don't take it up.

2401
02:17:41,833 --> 02:17:43,833
How can you be a cop?

2402
02:17:44,083 --> 02:17:44,583
Look...

2403
02:17:44,791 --> 02:17:46,666
A cop is something;
You're something else.

2404
02:17:47,166 --> 02:17:50,208
A cop actually goes around
arresting criminals.

2405
02:17:50,208 --> 02:17:51,291
But what would you do instead?

2406
02:17:51,333 --> 02:17:54,583
You'd call your friends
and ask them to pretend like criminals.

2407
02:17:54,708 --> 02:17:57,250
You'd go around
fooling the entire Police Department.

2408
02:17:57,666 --> 02:17:59,833
So, how can you be a good cop?

2409
02:18:00,083 --> 02:18:01,791
Kadhu, I am...
- Boss.

2410
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,291
Brother asked me to fetch you.

2411
02:18:04,541 --> 02:18:06,250
What is it?
- You come, Boss.

2412
02:18:06,791 --> 02:18:08,333
Just come, and you'd be our don.

2413
02:18:08,625 --> 02:18:09,625
You will be the rowdy.

2414
02:18:09,708 --> 02:18:10,833
Everyone is waiting for you.

2415
02:18:11,125 --> 02:18:11,958
Come on, Boss.

2416
02:18:14,375 --> 02:18:18,000
How dare you come and
talk like this to a cop?

2417
02:18:19,083 --> 02:18:21,333
If I ever see you around here...

2418
02:18:21,375 --> 02:18:21,875
Leave me Boss...

2419
02:18:21,916 --> 02:18:23,750
I'll shoot you and your Brother...

2420
02:18:24,125 --> 02:18:24,916
Sorry, Boss.

2421
02:18:25,416 --> 02:18:26,125
Saw that?

2422
02:18:26,833 --> 02:18:28,833
I like it better
when you're a rowdy.

2423
02:18:32,583 --> 02:18:33,416
Kadhu...

2424
02:18:34,333 --> 02:18:35,666
Listen carefully.

2425
02:18:36,291 --> 02:18:37,500
Cops are awesome.

2426
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:38,958
Rowdies are nothing.

2427
02:18:39,166 --> 02:18:40,541
Come.

2428
02:18:42,166 --> 02:18:42,875
So...

2429
02:18:43,750 --> 02:18:45,625
Rowdies are heroes in
most movies, alright.

2430
02:18:46,083 --> 02:18:47,333
He might be bold, too.

2431
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:49,000
But who kills him in an encounter?

2432
02:18:49,125 --> 02:18:50,083
It's the cop.

2433
02:18:50,166 --> 02:18:51,583
Then the cop is the hero, right?

2434
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:54,375
Careful.

2435
02:18:55,208 --> 02:18:58,875
Wearing that uniform is a
special feeling, Kadhambari.

2436
02:18:59,333 --> 02:19:01,000
Look at me. How do I look?

2437
02:19:01,208 --> 02:19:02,041
Very ordinary, right?

2438
02:19:02,208 --> 02:19:04,791
But you should see me in the uniform.
I'd look grand.
