1
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:27,414
As a kid growing up in the ghetto,

2
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:32,553
one of the things I wanted
most was not money, it was fame.

3
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:37,291
I wanted to be known. I want the
people to say, "Hey, there goes O.J."

4
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:50,904
You're approaching five
years now at Lovelock.

5
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:53,073
Tell us about your work assignments.

6
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:57,278
How have you occupied your
time for the past five years?

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,647
Uh, when I first came
here, I was a porter,

8
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:03,384
which comprised of cleaning
things in the unit that I was in,

9
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:07,554
and basically after a
relatively short period of time,

10
00:01:07,556 --> 00:01:10,891
I started working as a gym worker.

11
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:15,763
I start each day, um, disinfecting,
uh, the workout equipment in the gym,

12
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:20,734
mopping floors with the other, uh,
group of us that work in the gym.

13
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:25,306
Uh, I've coached teams, um,
uh, since I've been here.

14
00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:27,174
Uh, and I like to say that
we won the championship,

15
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:30,411
and we were old guys, a
totally mixed group of players.

16
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:32,613
I didn't play, I just coached.

17
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:38,185
I do see that in 1994 you
were arrested at the age of 46.

18
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:41,789
We... We're talking about this case?

19
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,590
No, the age at first arrest.

20
00:01:43,592 --> 00:01:47,428
How old were you, first time you
were arrested? For any reason.

21
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:55,202
Um, I think about 46, yes.

22
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:22,129
With an enrollment of
approximately 16,000 students,

23
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:24,331
this is the largest and oldest university

24
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,134
of continuous existence
in Southern California.

25
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:30,237
Its buildings and grounds cover 45 acres

26
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,806
and it has graduated many
thousands of men and women

27
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:35,609
who are now leaders in the
business and professional world.

28
00:02:44,153 --> 00:02:45,686
I didn't know that much about him.

29
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:48,789
I heard about his reputation
coming out of junior college.

30
00:02:56,832 --> 00:03:01,435
He was big, fast, powerful, dynamic.

31
00:03:01,437 --> 00:03:03,937
You're awed, because
you haven't seen that.

32
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:09,843
I was teaching part-time at San
Jose State and a friend of mine said,

33
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:15,749
"Hey, man, you gotta go check out this
little cat from, um, San Francisco.

34
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:17,985
His name is Simpson.
Orenthal James Simpson."

35
00:03:19,922 --> 00:03:22,856
O.J. takes the football. Boom.

36
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:28,262
I think he runs about 90
yards with it for a touchdown.

37
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:33,300
He ran through 'em like
foreign water through a tourist.

38
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:42,443
San Jose State was trying to
recruit him, and I asked him,

39
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:44,978
"O.J., what is it that
you're lookin' for?"

40
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:50,317
Said, "I wanna be the best.

41
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,020
I wanna go to a school where
I play against the best."

42
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:00,961
Superstar phenom is coming to USC

43
00:04:00,963 --> 00:04:03,063
and all the buzz that goes around with it.

44
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:07,968
This is Marguerite Simpson.

45
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,671
She and O.J. have been
married for five months now.

46
00:04:10,673 --> 00:04:11,839
Right.

47
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:13,674
Are you happy after five months?

48
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:15,108
Yes, I'm very happy.

49
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,677
And do you like this
campus and everything?

50
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:20,681
I love it. It's like a
resort. It's beautiful.

51
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:23,283
Now, you tell us the truth,
Marguerite. What kind of guy is O.J.?

52
00:04:23,285 --> 00:04:27,788
O.J. is very serious. He loves football.

53
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,923
And he's just a serious person.

54
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:36,263
He has a great running sense.

55
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:38,932
Uh, as a team man, he's
an outstanding person.

56
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:42,769
As a citizen, he is a
tremendous boy and, uh,

57
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:45,806
I don't think we've had a boy around
here who has ever been any better.

58
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:48,542
Whoo! Get up!

59
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:53,347
It was pretty obvious early on that
O.J. was a superiorathlete, special,

60
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:57,618
and Coach McKay was
warmer and closer with him.

61
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,055
He had never had a player of this
caliber. And you didn't mess with it.

62
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:03,590
He protected him.

63
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:08,729
Johnny, would you
describe that devastating

64
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:11,064
Southern Cal offensive attack for us?

65
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:14,001
Well, Duffy, I don't... I don't know
how devastating it is, but our attack

66
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:17,538
is built around the, uh, tailback,
O.J. Simpson, running a football.

67
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,275
We think our attack will be able to
let us move the ball on most people.

68
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:25,746
There was no drama.

69
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:29,316
John McKay was gonna
give him the football,

70
00:05:29,318 --> 00:05:32,019
and he was gonna give it
to him 35, 40 times a game

71
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:33,220
and you were gonna tackle him.

72
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:40,260
And then when you missed, we
were gonna score a touchdown.

73
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:42,996
So we fed him the football,
fed him the football...

74
00:05:46,602 --> 00:05:49,269
He had incredible stamina,

75
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:54,007
that he could take the ball
every play and keep on going.

76
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:59,179
Every game he did something
that was eye-opening.

77
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:01,148
You... "What? Did I see that?"

78
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:06,119
He was one of a kind.

79
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,401
This is O.J. Simpson,
USC's junior halfback.

80
00:06:21,403 --> 00:06:25,038
You have been getting an
awful lot of publicity lately.

81
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,306
How does it affect you? Does it bother ya?

82
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:27,908
Oh, it doesn't bother me at all.

83
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,610
It's... It's a matter of winning, I guess.

84
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:31,244
If you win, you get publicity,

85
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:34,881
and they have to give someone in our
offense and on our team publicity,

86
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:36,717
and, uh, I'm just in a position to get it,

87
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:39,953
running at the tailback and
carrying the ball as much as I do.

88
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:42,756
O.J., you've got an awful
big game on Saturday.

89
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:46,393
It's the big intercity rivalry.
There's just all kind of pressure.

90
00:06:46,395 --> 00:06:47,928
How does the pressure affect you?

91
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,997
Well, uh, I don't know.

92
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:50,831
I don't think the pressure bothers...

93
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,616
It doesn't bother me and...

94
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:54,400
and I think most of the team right
now, it's not bothering them yet.

95
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:56,269
I'm sure it will tomorrow.

96
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:58,438
We're shooting for all
the marbles this week,

97
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,607
and, uh, I think we'll be
relaxed and ready to go.

98
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:14,054
USC football is not a
matter of life and death.

99
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,992
It's much more important than that.

100
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:20,927
Live and in color, you
are looking at this view,

101
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:25,766
hovering above the Memorial
Coliseum which is jam packed today.

102
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:29,136
As we look at Gary Beban, a
reminder that college football,

103
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:32,773
a pleasant and colorful way
to spend an autumn afternoon.

104
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,444
UCLA's quarterback was Gary Beban.

105
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:39,880
It's gonna be his year
for the Heisman Trophy.

106
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:44,384
So we have the upcomer running back

107
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:46,953
against the established
superstar quarterback.

108
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:54,628
We were ranked number 4,
they were ranked number 1.

109
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,799
The city of Los Angeles, the
two top teams in the country,

110
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:01,968
and we're fighting for
the national championship.

111
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,038
Today with 10 cameras covering this game,

112
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,808
over 200, uh, newsmen
here, 200 photographers.

113
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,510
There were people out here
this morning at 6 o'clock

114
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:12,145
trying to get in to the ballgame.

115
00:08:12,147 --> 00:08:14,214
And the ballgame is underway.

116
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:16,750
I had never been to a college game ever.

117
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:18,585
And we all wanted to go see O.J.

118
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:23,457
Offensively now for the Trojans,
watch for number 32, O.J. Simpson.

119
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:28,495
None of us had any tickets.

120
00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:31,198
All of a sudden, we looked
up and someone had cut a hole

121
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,869
in the Coliseum fence and about 50
people ran through it, including us.

122
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:39,172
Okay, Bud, we have approximately 9
minutes remaining in the first half.

123
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:41,842
I'd never seen the
Coliseum full like that.

124
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:45,245
There was just the colors, I was in awe.

125
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:51,284
Tie ballgame, and they are in UCLA
territory. Steve Sogge. Simpson.

126
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:58,291
There's his brilliance.
Thirteen yards. Touchdown.

127
00:08:58,293 --> 00:09:03,897
A tremendously gifted athlete,
number 32, O.J. Simpson.

128
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,099
Everybody loved watching O.J. run.

129
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:08,034
As we look at it in slow motion...

130
00:09:08,036 --> 00:09:09,102
There was something about his style.

131
00:09:09,104 --> 00:09:10,937
... O.J. Simpson.

132
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:13,573
I said, "Man, if I could but
run half as well as this guy,

133
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:14,875
I might be all right."

134
00:09:14,877 --> 00:09:19,980
Beban hooking. Deep and long to Copeland.

135
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:23,016
UCLA has tied it up.

136
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:28,922
There is Nuttall.

137
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:31,958
Touchdown, UCLA.

138
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,964
And with 11 minutes and 40 seconds
left in the game UCLA gets the lead.

139
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:41,301
We were losing. And we were fighting.

140
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:43,970
O.J. Simpson is deep. Number 32.

141
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:46,006
And he's determined.

142
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:49,276
We were outplaying them,

143
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,113
and we were very angry that
we were not winning that game.

144
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:54,514
Thirty. Moving away,

145
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:59,519
and sheer sake of effort brings
him out to the 43-yard line.

146
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:04,524
Things weren't going
our way until that run.

147
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:07,928
Rose Bowl bid, Bud, is at stake.

148
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,462
Everything that they've
fought for all year,

149
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:12,332
it's coming down to the wire
now, Chris. These final minutes.

150
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:15,836
At the 36-yard line, a 4-yard gain,

151
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:17,971
it'll be third down at
three for the Trojans.

152
00:10:17,973 --> 00:10:19,439
It was a pass play.

153
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:20,607
They need three yards.

154
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:25,111
In the audible, and some
guys missed the audible.

155
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:31,551
I couldn't hear it. I made a
mistake. I stood up to pass block.

156
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:34,955
The linebacker read me and
backed into his passing zone,

157
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:37,724
and that opened up a lane for O.J.

158
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:39,960
And he did his magic.

159
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:43,163
First down and more. There's Simpson.

160
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:46,299
Look at that cut! O.J. Simpson!

161
00:10:48,237 --> 00:10:49,736
All she wrote.

162
00:10:49,738 --> 00:10:56,743
64 yards. 64 thrilling, captivating,
collegiate football yards,

163
00:10:56,745 --> 00:11:00,080
and let's look at that one again. Wow.

164
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:03,884
Don't recall seeing anybody that
can turn it on like this boy, Chris.

165
00:11:03,886 --> 00:11:09,189
If you were a football fan in the
late '60s and someone said to you,

166
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:13,093
"Do you remember the
run," it was just one run.

167
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:18,899
That set O.J. apart from everyone.

168
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:21,668
He's so much faster,
it makes no difference.

169
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:29,542
That single play is still felt to
be one of the greatest college plays.

170
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:33,146
He became an instant national star.

171
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:40,854
A civil rights leader
in Los Angeles has said

172
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:43,123
if you are going to be
a negro in a big city,

173
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,659
then, Los Angeles is the best place to be.

174
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:03,209
The image of Los Angeles
was milk and honey.

175
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:08,882
There's no prejudice in Los Angeles.
Everybody's free to do what they will.

176
00:12:08,884 --> 00:12:16,222
You know, palm trees and sunshine.
It's just the ultimate place.

177
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:19,392
And anybody who was trying to go
somewhere, at least in my area,

178
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:21,127
you know, they were going to Los Angeles.

179
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:27,901
There is no group in America to
whom California has meant more

180
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:30,136
than it has to the negroes.

181
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:34,140
In the two decades between 1940 and 1960,

182
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:36,743
while the population of all
other groups in Los Angeles

183
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:42,048
went up by 100 percent, the negro
population went up by 600 percent.

184
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:45,785
Where do the people come from?

185
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:51,224
People come from the states
of Texas, Louisiana, Georgia...

186
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:05,839
The hope is that all the
trouble I've known will be gone.

187
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:12,512
2, 4, 6, 8, we don't wanna integrate!

188
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:16,950
I will no longer be
held down by this notion

189
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:19,219
held against my skin and my hair.

190
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:39,239
More literally, I can get work
because it's growing so fast here.

191
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:40,807
And I can buy a house,

192
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:43,543
and nobody's ever gonna come take
it away from me because I'm black.

193
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:48,481
This is something that you
didn't have in the deep South.

194
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:55,388
The Simpsons are from Rodessa, Louisiana.

195
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,426
My parents and his parents,
they grew up on a 200-acre farm.

196
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:03,396
Although they had land, there was
no opportunity for people of color,

197
00:14:03,398 --> 00:14:06,099
so everybody "got out
of Dodge", as they say.

198
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:11,137
O.J. and I were born
in San Francisco in '47.

199
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:15,175
He had aspirations.

200
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:21,047
He knew that he wanted to
better his circumstances,

201
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:26,052
and LA was the place to do that.

202
00:14:26,054 --> 00:14:28,354
I moved out here looking
for opportunities.

203
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:31,558
My grandmother gave me
67 dollars for a ticket,

204
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,627
and my mother gave me 65 dollars to spend,

205
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:37,397
and I got on a plane, one-way ticket.

206
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,966
If I had the money, I
would've gone back home,

207
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:43,136
'cause it was very, very
troubling once I got out here.

208
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:47,273
Racism out here was as stark
as it was in Jim Crow South.

209
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:57,484
You don't really have any more
power out here than you had there.

210
00:14:57,486 --> 00:15:02,288
Everybody was always
conscious of the police.

211
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:05,258
You a friend of Jack Grant's?

212
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,126
Why?

213
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:06,993
Jack Grant a friend of yours?

214
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:08,161
I'm not gonna tell ya.

215
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:11,397
I grew up watching the Los
Angeles Police Department.

216
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,635
They just were so sharp and
professional all the time,

217
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:18,004
if you watched things that depicted them.

218
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,672
I'm Lieutenant Moore of the
Los Angeles Police Department.

219
00:15:19,674 --> 00:15:21,174
Hell, no, we won't go.

220
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:23,176
If you do not leave
now, you will be arrested

221
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:26,279
for violation of section 602-J.

222
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:28,181
They were just always squared away.

223
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,486
The institutional
culture was really clear.

224
00:15:33,488 --> 00:15:37,357
We expected you to be the best,
we expected you to be professional.

225
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:40,126
It's not like it was in the '30s and '40s.

226
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:42,662
Police officers don't take bribes.

227
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:48,101
There's none of that stuff, that
had been cleaned up by Chief Parker.

228
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:51,004
Chief Parker turned a very
corrupt police department

229
00:15:51,006 --> 00:15:54,774
into what was viewed as a
very honest police department,

230
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:58,178
but with that he brought a
level of being untouchable.

231
00:16:00,448 --> 00:16:03,550
Everything at the
police academy was white,

232
00:16:03,552 --> 00:16:07,187
in the sense of command staff,
officers, all the trainers were white.

233
00:16:09,457 --> 00:16:10,890
Bill Parker was reputed

234
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:14,294
to have actually recruited police
officers from the Klan rallies,

235
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:22,702
I think he, at minimum,
was racially insensitive,

236
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:25,805
at maximum, he was racist.

237
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:31,311
Police officers under Bill Parker
would respond to a radio call,

238
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:34,347
they would go snatch the
person who was causing trouble,

239
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:35,982
put 'em in the car,
take 'em out and leave.

240
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:37,984
So their interaction with the community

241
00:16:37,986 --> 00:16:42,222
was almost entirely based on apprehension,

242
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:45,592
and that's where the notion of
an occupying army comes from.

243
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:51,431
Just getting tired of being pushed
around by you white people, that's all.

244
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:54,667
You stoppin' us on the
street, kickin' down the doors,

245
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:57,337
takin' down to the police station,
you're kicking our teeth in.

246
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:01,608
Well, he took me in the car and,
uh, he just started getting on me.

247
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,709
But was there a fight?

248
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:06,112
How can I fight with my hands stuck?

249
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:10,750
The complaint that you hear
everywhere is that the negro

250
00:17:10,752 --> 00:17:13,119
is not getting the same treatment
from the police as the...

251
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:15,455
Well, I know, but I'm getting
a little bit weary of that,

252
00:17:15,457 --> 00:17:17,257
and I think perhaps the best thing to do

253
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:19,559
is just to pull the
police out of the area.

254
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:21,294
I've offered to do that again and again,

255
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:22,929
but you see how quick they
are to come back and say,

256
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:24,297
"We can't afford to have that."

257
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:32,305
The negroes are stepping
up, they're waking up,

258
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:35,708
and they're gonna do something
about what the white man did to them.

259
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,946
I'm not afraid of bloodshed. If I
have to die for my rights, I will.

260
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:47,320
54 square miles in the middle of
the nation's third-largest city.

261
00:17:47,322 --> 00:17:50,256
No one expected the
flashpoint of discontent to be

262
00:17:50,258 --> 00:17:54,627
in the sprawling, bungalow'd
450 square miles of Los Angeles.

263
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:59,832
This is when a fuse was lighted.

264
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:02,969
It began with the arrest by white
officers of two young negroes,

265
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:06,572
one on a charge of drunk
driving, the other his brother.

266
00:18:06,574 --> 00:18:08,007
Their mother came to the scene.

267
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:09,676
There was an argument,
there was a scuffle.

268
00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:12,645
By then, a crowd of several
hundred negroes had gathered.

269
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:16,015
The story of police brutality
quickly spread through the community.

270
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:29,996
The Watts riots. I was 10 years old, man.

271
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:41,774
It was summer, it was hot,

272
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:45,945
and white policemen had been
treating us like shit forever.

273
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:49,115
And we were gonna respond.

274
00:18:53,388 --> 00:18:57,190
The police in their idiocy
responded with too much force

275
00:18:57,192 --> 00:19:00,960
and not enough understanding,
and it mushroomed.

276
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,734
I was nervous.

277
00:19:07,736 --> 00:19:09,802
There were people
screaming, people shooting,

278
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:12,305
people lying on the ground, not moving.

279
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:15,041
The police, four-deep in a
car, all holding up shotguns.

280
00:19:17,979 --> 00:19:22,014
The Watts riot was one of the
first major events in the city of LA

281
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:24,350
that was caught on TV.

282
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:28,821
People who grew up looking at those
kinds of activities in the South,

283
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:32,592
they thought that's where
all of the racial divide was.

284
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:35,328
The only thing was missing
in LA, there weren't dogs.

285
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,231
Hands up there. Get 'em up.
Get your hands up. Let's go.

286
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:46,873
I got home and my father was
sitting there, upset, and he says,

287
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,574
"You know, Walter,
they're out there, riot."

288
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:55,415
And he says, "I wanna do that.
I feel that. I feel that anger.

289
00:19:57,452 --> 00:20:01,020
I know it's wrong, so I
can't do it. But I want to."

290
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:10,696
I didn't think it was a big deal.

291
00:20:10,698 --> 00:20:13,132
I didn't think these people
were, quote, "persecuted".

292
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:17,069
I didn't think these people had
any problem. Why were they rioting?

293
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:19,605
I was as naïve as any other white person.

294
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:24,010
This area is being closed.
Please go in your homes.

295
00:20:27,315 --> 00:20:29,549
The question came down from
white people after Watts.

296
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:32,718
They said, "Do most black
people feel like this?"

297
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,454
And the answer came back,

298
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:38,658
"About 99 percent of them feel like
this. And one percent are really mad."

299
00:20:40,462 --> 00:20:43,296
In creating this situation,
where was the failure?

300
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:45,898
On the part of the city,
the county, the schools?

301
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,168
This, sir, I think, is one of
the difficulties in meeting this,

302
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,638
is that we're trying to find a failure
other than the people themselves.

303
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,408
They came in and...
and flooded a community

304
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,310
that wasn't prepared to meet them.

305
00:20:57,312 --> 00:20:59,846
We didn't ask these people to come here.

306
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:04,116
So long as this stubborn
attitude is maintained,

307
00:21:04,118 --> 00:21:06,652
I can only see the situation worsening.

308
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:14,126
I can still smell the
smoulderings of that event.

309
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:19,832
There was nervousness all over the place

310
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:26,205
that would ultimately translate into
traumatizing an entire community.

311
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:29,642
Better to make all the rioting stop.

312
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:32,445
I don't think it'll ever stop, really.

313
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:33,746
Ever?

314
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:41,053
And the institution that gave
life to O.J. Simpson's image

315
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:44,857
and presence nationally
and beyond was located

316
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:48,394
right in the middle of
that very same neighborhood.

317
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:56,536
USC was an isolated, beautiful
school right next to the LA Coliseum

318
00:21:56,538 --> 00:22:02,875
and on the other side were the
slums of LA. Basically Watts.

319
00:22:06,014 --> 00:22:11,083
Everyone was warned not to go
down on that side of the Coliseum.

320
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:16,389
At the University of Southern California,

321
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:18,724
they have a living
legend, and at homecoming,

322
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:21,193
that's all they wanna talk about.

323
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:24,397
The name of the legend is O.J. Simpson.

324
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:28,100
When you saw him on campus, it
was like, "Wow! There's O.J.!"

325
00:22:28,102 --> 00:22:31,070
And you might go up and wave
and say, "Way to go, O.J.,"

326
00:22:31,072 --> 00:22:32,838
and he'd give you a big smile,

327
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,941
and you felt like you
were a million dollars.

328
00:22:34,943 --> 00:22:37,743
You felt fantastic. "O.J.
Simpson said "hi" to me!"

329
00:22:37,745 --> 00:22:38,911
Yeah.

330
00:22:38,913 --> 00:22:39,912
Hey, O.J., how are ya? How's it... ?

331
00:22:39,914 --> 00:22:41,247
Working hard.

332
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:43,182
I hope you're gonna be smiling Saturday.

333
00:22:43,184 --> 00:22:47,286
Yeah, in about four
days or five. I plan to.

334
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:51,223
For most of the USC students,
I wager, O.J. Simpson

335
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:55,962
was the first African-American
they really got to see and talk to.

336
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:58,030
Because most of them didn't
know African-Americans at all,

337
00:22:58,032 --> 00:22:59,899
or any person of color.

338
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:02,401
We are! SC!

339
00:23:02,403 --> 00:23:04,370
We are! SC!

340
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:09,609
USC was a football school,
it was a Hollywood school,

341
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:13,045
it was glamour and glitz,

342
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:16,482
it was not the University
of California at Berkeley.

343
00:23:16,484 --> 00:23:18,651
It was not San Jose State.

344
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:21,921
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

345
00:23:21,923 --> 00:23:26,626
It was above and beyond
reach of the movement.

346
00:23:30,498 --> 00:23:38,838
O.J. went to USC in 1967, so he's
plucked out of the black community,

347
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:46,479
out of black consciousness, and he's
submerged in an all-white university.

348
00:23:46,481 --> 00:23:49,749
And I say this, and I
don't say it facetiously,

349
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:57,056
but he is seduced by white society.

350
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:06,932
USC controls TV,
Hollywood, banking, finance,

351
00:24:06,934 --> 00:24:09,268
law and medicine in Los Angeles.

352
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:15,207
The alumni are very powerful,
and their whole existence

353
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:18,944
revolves around the success
of the football team.

354
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:21,447
And O.J. is leading them to glory.

355
00:24:24,185 --> 00:24:28,888
It was that type of school with
that type of power and control

356
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,123
that could be directed towards him.

357
00:24:35,196 --> 00:24:37,196
The black man has been brainwashed,

358
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:39,131
and it's time for him to
learn something about himself.

359
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:42,968
The word "black" is a part of the times.

360
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:46,672
We are succumbing to the demands
of the black man in the street

361
00:24:46,674 --> 00:24:51,877
who says that the negro is
dead and the black man is alive.

362
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:55,381
It was a condition that I was born into;

363
00:24:55,383 --> 00:24:58,451
the unfairness, the racism, the hatred,

364
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:05,124
the poverty that we had in this country.

365
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:10,796
You can't balance that
with being a football hero.

366
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:23,609
In the '60s, societal issues were
pushing their way into sports.

367
00:25:26,914 --> 00:25:30,416
It has been said that
I have two alternatives,

368
00:25:30,418 --> 00:25:34,019
either go to jail or go to the army.

369
00:25:34,021 --> 00:25:38,090
There was this engagement of the athlete.

370
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:41,227
Some major athletes stood up.

371
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:44,363
Nine top negro athletes
meet with Cassius Clay

372
00:25:44,365 --> 00:25:46,699
to discuss his anti-draft stand.

373
00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:49,101
They include Bill Russell, Lou Alcindor,

374
00:25:49,103 --> 00:25:51,937
and former pro-footballer Jimmy Brown.

375
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:58,544
Every man in that room was a soldier.

376
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:01,413
Every man in that room, for
nothing other than his beliefs

377
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:06,118
and backing another brother,
felt that he should be there

378
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,320
and the hell with the consequences.

379
00:26:10,658 --> 00:26:16,495
Jim Brown, Bill Russell,
Ali, for sure, were race men.

380
00:26:16,497 --> 00:26:19,598
They stood up for principle

381
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,469
and damaged their
commercial possibilities.

382
00:26:23,471 --> 00:26:26,939
They pointed to the discrimination,

383
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:30,776
not only of all blacks,
but of black athletes,

384
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:35,014
of people who were supposedly
given entitlement in America.

385
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:42,354
At the time you were supposed
to be satisfied. Or grateful.

386
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:46,659
Why would someone that's making money

387
00:26:46,661 --> 00:26:49,862
and cheered by 80,000
people be complaining?

388
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:59,205
For me, it was really a matter
of fairness and what is correct.

389
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:03,542
The United States has
hypocritically put itself up

390
00:27:03,544 --> 00:27:07,646
as the leader of the free world,
while right here in this country

391
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:12,318
there are 22 million black
people who are catching more hell

392
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,821
than anyone in any communist
country ever dreamed of.

393
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:21,060
Black men and women athletes,
professional and amateur,

394
00:27:21,062 --> 00:27:25,297
have unanimously voted to
fully endorse and participate

395
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:30,102
in a boycott of the World
Olympic Games in 1968.

396
00:27:36,644 --> 00:27:38,711
The movement on the West Coast recently

397
00:27:38,713 --> 00:27:42,681
in which Lou Alcindor supposedly said
he might not play in the Olympics.

398
00:27:42,683 --> 00:27:44,316
What are your thoughts?

399
00:27:44,318 --> 00:27:47,853
Well, um... Well, this is his prerogative.

400
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:51,190
I'm not too well
enlightened on the situation.

401
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:53,325
I don't know exactly what
they're trying to do, you know.

402
00:27:56,364 --> 00:28:00,432
The whole idea behind the
Olympic Project for Human Rights

403
00:28:00,434 --> 00:28:05,671
was to escalate the relationship
between elite athletes

404
00:28:05,673 --> 00:28:10,109
and the civil rights movement.

405
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:15,214
Let me say that I absolutely
support this boycott.

406
00:28:15,216 --> 00:28:20,219
I would also like to commend
the outstanding athletes

407
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:24,423
who have the courage to make it
clear that they will not participate

408
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:30,629
unless something is done about
these terrible evils and injustices.

409
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:33,365
O.J. was approached because he was

410
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:36,869
the biggest name in collegiate
athletics at that time.

411
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:42,441
He was also a world
record-holding track star.

412
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:43,309
That's O.J. Simpson...

413
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:46,745
So here we got two for one.

414
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:49,448
... and Lennox Miller...

415
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,319
When I asked him, I said we
were trying to get black athletes

416
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:56,956
to understand they have a role in
the current civil rights movement,

417
00:28:56,958 --> 00:29:00,826
his response was, "I'm
not black. I'm O.J."

418
00:29:00,828 --> 00:29:03,929
What they think is right, I guess,
they must follow their beliefs.

419
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:06,565
Well, uh, right now I don't
wanna be involved in it, because,

420
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:09,435
uh, I'm not in track. You know,
I'm running track, but when it...

421
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:11,637
when it comes to Olympic
time, I'll be in football,

422
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:14,573
so I have no comment on the matter.

423
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:20,279
O.J. was saying, "I want to be
judged not by the color of my skin,

424
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:23,949
I want to be judged by
the content of my character

425
00:29:23,951 --> 00:29:27,753
and. Most of all, the
caliber of my competence.

426
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:30,789
I think I'm the greatest football
player that this country's ever seen.

427
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:32,391
That's all I wanna be judged by.

428
00:29:33,761 --> 00:29:37,930
Don't tell me I've gotta
do this because I'm black."

429
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:46,772
I think football is a great sport.
It teaches a person an awful lot.

430
00:29:46,774 --> 00:29:50,509
I would say there's less prejudice in
sports than any other field anywhere,

431
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:54,046
because, uh, it just... you're
accepted as what you are,

432
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,015
you know, an athlete and what you can do,

433
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:57,282
and I think this is good for anyone.

434
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:12,965
Simpson rushed for 1709 yards in 1968,

435
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:15,167
more than any other back in history.

436
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:19,304
His durability is almost as
legendary as his speed and moves.

437
00:30:19,306 --> 00:30:22,474
Simpson scored 22 touchdowns.

438
00:30:22,476 --> 00:30:28,914
He carried a record 355 times and
proved himself nearly indestructible.

439
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:38,891
He was in a different
world than the rest of us.

440
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:49,068
There was an O.J. cult. It was
building, building, building.

441
00:30:50,738 --> 00:30:54,873
When you bring a student athlete in
there on a visit, they wanna see O.J.

442
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:59,945
The community leaders, for speaking
engagements, they wanted O.J.

443
00:30:59,947 --> 00:31:05,350
They wanted a role model. They
wanted the young black kids to see.

444
00:31:05,352 --> 00:31:09,354
When I was 16 years old, I made an
all-star team down in Los Angeles

445
00:31:09,356 --> 00:31:12,391
and they had a banquet,
and while we were eating,

446
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:13,892
the guy who was running
the whole show, he says,

447
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:17,729
"Okay, I wanna introduce the guest
speaker tonight, O.J. Simpson."

448
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:22,968
And I was like, "Wow!" I said,
"O.J.'s here. This is unbelievable."

449
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,137
O.J., when he walked up, he said,

450
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:27,706
"First of all, before I
start, is Ron Shipp here?"

451
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:31,777
I put my hand up. I was like,
"Is this... ? Is this for real?"

452
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:36,615
And he goes, "Are you the brother
of Michael Shipp?" And I say, "Yes."

453
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:39,118
And he goes, "Hey, everybody,
I just wanna tell you about,

454
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,953
uh, Michael Shipp, his brother,

455
00:31:40,955 --> 00:31:42,788
we played against each
other, he's a great guy,

456
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:46,125
so on and so, Ron, if you're anything
like your brother, you know... "

457
00:31:46,127 --> 00:31:50,662
and, like, he made me an
instant hero in that room.

458
00:31:50,664 --> 00:31:52,264
I mean, I fell in love
with the guy right then.

459
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:56,135
This is the most incredible human being.

460
00:32:00,107 --> 00:32:05,010
Here is the star of our show, Bob Hope.

461
00:32:10,117 --> 00:32:14,186
I don't have to tell you it's
a pleasure to be here at OJU.

462
00:32:16,757 --> 00:32:19,591
But it's wonderful to be here at USC.

463
00:32:19,593 --> 00:32:21,960
You haven't had a riot, a
demonstration or even a sit in.

464
00:32:21,962 --> 00:32:23,595
Are you sure this is a college?

465
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,335
I have some very sad news for all of you.

466
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:35,841
Martin Luther King was shot and
was killed tonight in Memphis.

467
00:32:35,843 --> 00:32:37,976
I tried to talk to O.J. before the show,

468
00:32:37,978 --> 00:32:40,179
but I guess he has something on his mind.

469
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:44,616
He kept referring to me as Mr. Heisman.

470
00:32:44,618 --> 00:32:49,087
RFK, RFK, RFK!

471
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:03,235
Pigs, pigs, pigs, pigs!

472
00:33:06,507 --> 00:33:08,507
O.J., you've had quite a season.

473
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:10,509
Well, I have gained a few yards.

474
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:15,380
A few yards? You've gobbled up
more real estate than Howard Hughes.

475
00:33:15,382 --> 00:33:18,550
When you think of 1968,
what do you think of?

476
00:33:22,223 --> 00:33:27,926
1968, I think of winning all
the games, getting O.J. famous,

477
00:33:27,928 --> 00:33:31,263
everybody on campus thinking
it's the greatest thing on earth.

478
00:33:31,265 --> 00:33:35,000
That's all we thought about.
There was nothing else going on.

479
00:33:42,276 --> 00:33:44,676
Several European
newspapers today condemned

480
00:33:44,678 --> 00:33:47,412
the International Olympic
Committee for sending home

481
00:33:47,414 --> 00:33:50,515
two militant negro athletes
from the United States.

482
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:53,085
The two, Tommie Smith and John Carlos,

483
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:56,088
who ran first and third
in the 200-meter dash,

484
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,424
were banished after they raised
clenched fists in black gloves

485
00:33:59,426 --> 00:34:01,593
during the playing of
The Star Spangled Banner.

486
00:34:01,595 --> 00:34:05,230
Uh, with your bad self!

487
00:34:05,232 --> 00:34:07,466
Say it loud!

488
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:09,067
I'm black, and I'm proud!

489
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:11,820
I didn't believe in the national anthem,

490
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:14,572
but I stood up anyway, because
I didn't want no static,

491
00:34:14,575 --> 00:34:15,607
but those days are gone.

492
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:17,609
Right on.

493
00:34:17,611 --> 00:34:21,113
Brother Tommie Smith, Brother Johnny
Carlos and Brother Harry Edwards

494
00:34:21,115 --> 00:34:23,115
join the ranks of Brother Muhammed Ali,

495
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:25,617
because we want black people
who are concerned with us first

496
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,286
and with sports second.

497
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:28,687
Yeah!

498
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,556
Say it loud!

499
00:34:31,558 --> 00:34:33,625
I'm black, and I'm proud!

500
00:34:35,896 --> 00:34:40,499
At about, uh, 10 o'clock this
morning, we were notified that,

501
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:44,002
uh, a Heisman Trophy
winner comes back to USC

502
00:34:44,004 --> 00:34:47,306
and, as you all know, it's O.J. Simpson.

503
00:34:50,644 --> 00:34:54,846
Thank you. Well, I... I
don't know quite what to say.

504
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,849
I'm, uh, certainly
proud, and I'm very happy,

505
00:34:57,851 --> 00:35:00,619
and I'm... I'm taking it as a team
award and all the other guys did as much

506
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:03,021
if not more than I do,
for me to get the award,

507
00:35:03,023 --> 00:35:04,356
and I'll be glad to see all the guys,

508
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:05,924
'cause I know they're
just as happy as I am.

509
00:35:08,128 --> 00:35:11,997
As you can see, the Heisman
Trophy award ceremony is over,

510
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:16,201
and O.J. Simpson, number 32, the
University of Southern California,

511
00:35:16,203 --> 00:35:18,036
has been beset by autograph hounds.

512
00:35:18,038 --> 00:35:21,673
Mrs. Simpson, I wonder if you'd
be good enough to come over.

513
00:35:21,675 --> 00:35:25,610
Your tears only registered your
pride, and it's a very great pride,

514
00:35:25,612 --> 00:35:28,780
and you should enjoy it, because
this is a very great young man.

515
00:35:28,782 --> 00:35:34,386
O.J., the congratulations of all of
us to you for a truly remarkable season

516
00:35:34,388 --> 00:35:37,389
and more importantly for
your impeccable character.

517
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:39,524
Thank you, Mr. Cosell.

518
00:35:39,526 --> 00:35:41,526
So that's the story.

519
00:35:41,528 --> 00:35:45,664
The Heisman award proceedings,
number 32, O.J. Simpson.

520
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:50,969
Perhaps the greatest running back
in the history of college football.

521
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:59,411
When I met him, I was
quite taken with him.

522
00:35:59,413 --> 00:36:04,182
This is kind of a warm June night in 1969.

523
00:36:04,184 --> 00:36:08,987
Howard Cosell took O.J.
and me to Bachelors III,

524
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:13,392
which was Joe Namath's bar.

525
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:19,064
He was telling a story about being
at a teammate's wedding with his wife

526
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:24,035
sitting at a table of
mostly, as he said, negroes,

527
00:36:24,037 --> 00:36:28,573
and you overheard a white
woman at the next table saying,

528
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:33,345
"Look, there's O.J. sitting
with all those niggers."

529
00:36:33,347 --> 00:36:38,717
And I remember in my
naiveté, saying to O.J.,

530
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:42,254
"Gee, wow, that must have
been terrible for you."

531
00:36:42,256 --> 00:36:47,058
"No, that was great. Don't you understand?

532
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:54,699
She knew that I wasn't
black. She saw me as O.J."

533
00:36:54,701 --> 00:36:59,104
And... And really, at that moment,
um, I thought he was fucked.

534
00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:04,776
Our first guest today is one of the
greatest running backs I've ever seen.

535
00:37:04,778 --> 00:37:07,879
I met him when he was still in
college at Southern California,

536
00:37:07,881 --> 00:37:10,549
and he's not only a hell of a
football player, he's a hell of a guy.

537
00:37:10,551 --> 00:37:13,218
The winner of the Heisman trophy,
the finest college football player

538
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,753
in the country last year,

539
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:17,255
the Buffalo Bills' great
rookie, O.J. Simpson.

540
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:20,659
Thank you, Joe.

541
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:23,462
Now, with all that money you
got for signing with Buffalo,

542
00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:26,164
I wanna know if you're gonna help
me out in some business interests.

543
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:28,433
How's business?

544
00:37:28,435 --> 00:37:30,001
Oh, it's pretty good.

545
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:33,004
I, uh, I'm under contract with... I
don't know if I can say it. I'm here.

546
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:34,406
Yeah.

547
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:36,174
Well, I'm under contract
with Chevrolet and RC Cola,

548
00:37:36,176 --> 00:37:38,410
and I'm working with,
um... What network is it?

549
00:37:40,113 --> 00:37:41,296
ABC.

550
00:37:41,297 --> 00:37:42,480
And, uh, they're keeping me pretty busy.

551
00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:49,321
The pitch to Chevrolet was

552
00:37:49,323 --> 00:37:52,757
that this would be the first
national black spokesman.

553
00:37:52,759 --> 00:37:55,460
You've got a black market.

554
00:37:55,462 --> 00:37:59,297
He's not gonna be a negative
in any way to the white market,

555
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:03,335
but you're gonna get a lot of
brownie points just for stepping up.

556
00:38:03,337 --> 00:38:07,873
O.J.? It's a real satisfaction
to me to be able to introduce

557
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,374
a great ballplayer like you

558
00:38:09,376 --> 00:38:11,776
to an equally great group
of Chevrolet salesmen.

559
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:13,678
My pleasure, Chris.

560
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,382
At the time, athlete endorsements
were virtually non-existent.

561
00:38:17,384 --> 00:38:22,053
And for them to sign him, a
black man, a football player,

562
00:38:22,055 --> 00:38:23,688
was ground-breaking.

563
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,557
They tell me that the
Chevrolet selling team

564
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:28,326
is the greatest in the
country. I believe that.

565
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:29,794
That's what made perfect sense.

566
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:34,366
O.J. Simpson was the
counterrevolutionary athlete.

567
00:38:34,368 --> 00:38:40,805
White America is looking for
somebody who can erase the threat

568
00:38:40,807 --> 00:38:45,310
of these seemingly angry
principled black athletes

569
00:38:45,312 --> 00:38:49,414
who are going to create
a revolution in sports.

570
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:53,351
O.J. made people feel good.

571
00:38:53,353 --> 00:38:56,655
It was clear once you
spent some time with O.J.

572
00:38:56,657 --> 00:39:00,191
that the Carlos, you know, fist
pump, and those kinds of, uh,

573
00:39:00,193 --> 00:39:04,663
situations were not gonna be, you
know, present in... in dealing with him.

574
00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:09,501
He just gave you that confidence that
he understood what this was about.

575
00:39:09,503 --> 00:39:14,339
I'd like to welcome a new member
of the ABC sports commentary staff.

576
00:39:14,341 --> 00:39:16,608
It is O.J. Simpson.

577
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,911
Uh, well, Jim, I'll be doing
basically sports work with the, uh,

578
00:39:19,913 --> 00:39:23,782
ABC radio networks and the TV
nextworks... networks. I hope...

579
00:39:23,784 --> 00:39:27,686
O.J. was very, very rough and needed
a lot of coaching in the early years.

580
00:39:27,688 --> 00:39:30,455
It's pretty interesting, and
I'm really looking forward to it.

581
00:39:30,457 --> 00:39:34,259
We obviously wanted him to be
able to speak proper English

582
00:39:34,261 --> 00:39:38,129
and eliminate slang, and he
didn't ever take offense at that.

583
00:39:38,131 --> 00:39:41,166
It was, "Thank you." You
know? "Okay, I got it."

584
00:39:42,736 --> 00:39:49,074
He realized that his Horatio
Alger story was based on

585
00:39:49,076 --> 00:39:53,011
him being a pleasing
person to white people.

586
00:39:54,781 --> 00:39:59,217
I really had the sense that he
was enormously self-conscious

587
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:03,321
of who he was and who he
needed to be to get over.

588
00:40:03,323 --> 00:40:09,260
That there was this character,
O.J., which he was creating.

589
00:40:09,262 --> 00:40:11,262
What does O.J. stand for?

590
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,497
Oh, Joe.

591
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:14,332
Come on, tell it. Tell me.

592
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:16,101
Orenthal James Simpson.

593
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:16,968
Good.

594
00:40:18,338 --> 00:40:19,337
Now, that's a nice name, Orenthal.

595
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:20,472
Yeah.

596
00:40:21,274 --> 00:40:22,474
It's a good name.

597
00:40:22,476 --> 00:40:24,643
You... You never got in any
arguments over that, did ya?

598
00:40:24,645 --> 00:40:27,445
No, no, I had, uh... I had some pretty
good friends, pretty big friends,

599
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:29,280
and they were the only guys
who could tease me about it.

600
00:40:29,282 --> 00:40:32,417
Well, in your movie career,
uh, motion picture industry,

601
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:33,585
are they gonna call you
Orenthal James or... ?

602
00:40:33,587 --> 00:40:34,352
They're gonna call me O.J.

603
00:40:35,756 --> 00:40:41,826
I was taken by O.J. as a character,
as somebody to write about,

604
00:40:41,828 --> 00:40:48,433
that somebody was so self-aware
and so obviously ambitious.

605
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:54,105
The question in my mind
then and still now is

606
00:40:54,107 --> 00:40:56,374
where did this imagination come from?

607
00:40:56,376 --> 00:41:02,013
Where did he begin to write
this novel about O.J. Simpson?

608
00:41:17,731 --> 00:41:21,666
Everybody looks at San Francisco
now, "Oh, it's this cosmopolitan...

609
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:24,069
Oh, you know, everybody
loves everybody gooshy goosh."

610
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:26,805
It's not. It wasn't like that, man.

611
00:41:31,144 --> 00:41:34,879
Potrero Hill was
predominantly African-American.

612
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:38,983
Public housing, the old
barracks from the navy.

613
00:41:38,985 --> 00:41:43,388
When the navy left, the city
turned 'em into low-income housing.

614
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,956
It was a rough area.

615
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:51,496
The Simpsons lived at
the top of a big hill.

616
00:41:51,498 --> 00:41:55,233
Carmelita, his younger
sister Shirley had a room,

617
00:41:55,235 --> 00:41:57,402
and Melvin and O.J. had a room.

618
00:41:59,005 --> 00:42:00,939
We crawled around on the floor together

619
00:42:00,941 --> 00:42:04,442
before we ever learned how to walk.

620
00:42:04,444 --> 00:42:08,379
Four months apart. I'm born
in March, he's born in July.

621
00:42:08,381 --> 00:42:10,882
We'd spend a lot of time
at each other's house.

622
00:42:10,884 --> 00:42:14,452
We're a close-knit family.

623
00:42:14,454 --> 00:42:19,958
The mother worked at night, so they
were responsible for themselves,

624
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,060
and sometimes he would
open the refrigerator

625
00:42:22,062 --> 00:42:24,362
and there just wouldn't
be nothing in there,

626
00:42:24,364 --> 00:42:28,433
and I'd say, "Well, come on, let's
go to my house and eat dinner."

627
00:42:28,435 --> 00:42:32,737
O.J.'s mother, my aunt Eunice,
worked the graveyard shift

628
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:35,373
at San Francisco General Hospital.

629
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,976
She was a provider, she was steady,

630
00:42:37,978 --> 00:42:42,714
but if you're in a single-parent
situation, you know,

631
00:42:42,716 --> 00:42:44,449
there's never enough money.

632
00:42:47,053 --> 00:42:49,554
I mean, we were poor kids, you know.

633
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:53,958
We would steal cars, we would
break into somebody's house,

634
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,595
take all the women's purses
and stuff like... You know.

635
00:42:57,597 --> 00:42:59,364
We would be called criminals.

636
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:04,969
From the time we were 10 years
old, you know, we were hustlers.

637
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:06,571
You know, you'd go to the
football game, scalp tickets,

638
00:43:06,573 --> 00:43:07,639
and everybody had their own technique.

639
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:09,107
Yeah.

640
00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:11,643
I would... I can recall crying
in front of a cat, you know.

641
00:43:11,645 --> 00:43:15,480
"Oh, I need it." "Please let
me have that ticket." You know?

642
00:43:17,017 --> 00:43:20,485
"I wanna see... I wanna see
Hugh McElhenny play," you know?

643
00:43:20,487 --> 00:43:22,320
Cats break down, give you the ticket,

644
00:43:22,322 --> 00:43:24,155
I would go on the other side
of the stadium and sell it.

645
00:43:24,157 --> 00:43:25,957
Why didn't I think of that?

646
00:43:29,196 --> 00:43:31,496
Did you ever see him in any fist fights?

647
00:43:31,498 --> 00:43:33,198
O.J. didn't fight.

648
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,199
No?

649
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:35,633
No. O.J. was boisterous.

650
00:43:35,635 --> 00:43:38,770
When you say he was boisterous,
did you ever see him,

651
00:43:38,772 --> 00:43:42,307
uh, talk himself out of
a... a fight situation?

652
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:46,010
I've seen O.J. fight... Talk
himself out of a lot of situations.

653
00:43:53,987 --> 00:43:56,287
There was this one incident at school.

654
00:43:58,725 --> 00:44:04,362
Myself, Al Collins and O.J., we were
all in the bathroom shooting crap.

655
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:11,870
We were cursing and talking
loud, and I was shaking the dice,

656
00:44:11,872 --> 00:44:19,244
and, all of a sudden, these big
wingtip shoes slide in the circle,

657
00:44:19,246 --> 00:44:23,047
and I looked up, and it was Coach McBride.

658
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:26,684
We were all on the football team.

659
00:44:26,686 --> 00:44:32,156
We're like, "Okay, Mr. McBride,
we're busted. Let us go to class."

660
00:44:32,158 --> 00:44:37,128
He's like, "No." He's gonna take
us to the principal's office.

661
00:44:38,698 --> 00:44:43,434
O.J. stays in back of the
pack. I could hear him,

662
00:44:43,436 --> 00:44:48,106
"Oh, come on, Mr. McBride. You
know we're gonna be suspended."

663
00:44:48,108 --> 00:44:51,876
So we get in the principal's office.

664
00:44:51,878 --> 00:44:56,948
Coach McBride says, "I caught these
guys in the bathroom shooting dice."

665
00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:00,551
And then he turned and walked out.

666
00:45:00,553 --> 00:45:05,056
So O.J. turns and walks away.

667
00:45:05,058 --> 00:45:08,293
Dean Smith says,
"Simpson, where you going?"

668
00:45:08,295 --> 00:45:13,398
He says, "Oh, I was just helping
Mr. McBride bring these guys down."

669
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,702
And Dean Smith let him go.

670
00:45:28,048 --> 00:45:34,118
Self-preservation. It was
just that kind of smooth talk

671
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,289
that O.J. would do in
all kinds of situations.

672
00:45:39,592 --> 00:45:40,591
Do you think he was
shown a little preference

673
00:45:40,593 --> 00:45:41,326
because of his football ability?

674
00:45:41,328 --> 00:45:43,127
Oh, yes.

675
00:45:43,129 --> 00:45:46,831
You said you had seen Simpson talk
himself out of lots of situations.

676
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:49,334
Oh, yeah, talked himself... with me.

677
00:45:51,404 --> 00:45:55,139
When we were younger, Al
Collins used to stutter,

678
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:58,276
and he never was good
with talking to girls.

679
00:45:58,278 --> 00:46:02,580
Marguerite was the nice girl
from the other side of town,

680
00:46:02,582 --> 00:46:07,518
but Marguerite liked Alan,
and they wound up going steady.

681
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:14,759
There was some party,
and O.J. came and got me.

682
00:46:14,761 --> 00:46:17,428
I thought we was going
straight to the party,

683
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,465
but we pull up in front
of Marguerite's house,

684
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:26,671
and he tells me to get in the back,
and I'm, like, in shock, like, you know,

685
00:46:26,673 --> 00:46:29,407
I seen her with... you know,
walking with... with Alan.

686
00:46:31,144 --> 00:46:35,380
We go down to where the
party is, and Alan spots us,

687
00:46:35,382 --> 00:46:39,984
and he starts shaking his
head and, "No! No way!"

688
00:46:39,986 --> 00:46:44,022
He is furious, and Al is a big guy.

689
00:46:44,024 --> 00:46:47,158
And he grabs the car, and he's rocking it,

690
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:53,164
rocking the car back and
forth, just rocking it.

691
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:59,804
And Marguerite gets out of the
car, she says, "Alan, stop it."

692
00:46:59,806 --> 00:47:05,209
And he stops. And we were
like, "No, he didn't."

693
00:47:05,211 --> 00:47:10,648
How could O.J. keep getting
out of these situations?

694
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,718
He stole his best friend's girl.

695
00:47:16,389 --> 00:47:24,062
Later on, you see the three of them
together. Alan went to USC also.

696
00:47:24,064 --> 00:47:26,664
They were as thick as thieves.

697
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:29,434
Everywhere he went, A.C. was with him.

698
00:47:29,436 --> 00:47:32,937
Football really was
what brought us together.

699
00:47:32,939 --> 00:47:34,705
We were really braggadocious, you know.

700
00:47:34,707 --> 00:47:39,210
We were like, "I'm gonna
be a pro football player,"

701
00:47:39,212 --> 00:47:42,046
and O.J. said something
that really struck me.

702
00:47:42,048 --> 00:47:46,551
He says, "Man, let me tell you
guys something. One of these days,

703
00:47:46,553 --> 00:47:52,123
your children are gonna be fighting
over who wants to be O.J. Simpson."

704
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:58,629
He knew that he was going to be somebody.

705
00:47:58,631 --> 00:48:02,600
He was self-assured. I'll
just... I'll just put it that way.

706
00:48:02,602 --> 00:48:05,770
O.J. has always wanted to be a hero.

707
00:48:09,242 --> 00:48:13,978
If it was looking at Burt Lancaster
on The Man on the Flying Trapeze

708
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:20,551
or Burt Lancaster playing Jim
Thorpe, he always wanted to be a hero.

709
00:48:20,553 --> 00:48:22,186
An American hero.

710
00:48:38,004 --> 00:48:42,607
The Buffalo Bills select as their
first choice in the first round,

711
00:48:42,609 --> 00:48:45,743
halfback O.J. Simpson, the
University of Southern California.

712
00:48:50,483 --> 00:48:55,453
It was the last place you'd wanna be.

713
00:48:55,455 --> 00:48:57,722
It was just like being sent to Siberia.

714
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:11,669
There was some players that
said, "Oh, Mr. Hotshot."

715
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:16,007
He understood that people
around him was envious

716
00:49:16,009 --> 00:49:18,075
what he was getting and what he was doing.

717
00:49:22,715 --> 00:49:25,850
Stand by and go whenever
you're ready, O.J.

718
00:49:27,687 --> 00:49:32,723
Well, there was never much
doubt about missing him.

719
00:49:32,725 --> 00:49:37,728
Uh, that was O.J. Simpson. O.J. is
now a professional football player.

720
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:41,399
The Buffalo Bills is his
home, and the question is

721
00:49:41,401 --> 00:49:44,535
how many professional defensive
tacklers is he going to get by?

722
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:48,539
So what kind of an attitude

723
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:51,242
must O.J. Simpson have to
play professional football?

724
00:49:51,244 --> 00:49:53,744
Well, he's gonna have
to be strong-willed,

725
00:49:53,746 --> 00:49:55,713
uh, in many different ways,

726
00:49:55,715 --> 00:49:58,849
because he will have a lot of people
picking at him, he'll have a lot of...

727
00:49:58,851 --> 00:50:01,252
We had a couch, John Rauch,

728
00:50:01,254 --> 00:50:03,821
which I've considered the
worst coach that we ever had.

729
00:50:03,823 --> 00:50:05,590
Blocking, he will have to block,

730
00:50:05,592 --> 00:50:08,059
because other people
are ball carriers also.

731
00:50:08,061 --> 00:50:11,229
He tried to make O.J. a
receiver, more or less.

732
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:14,732
What we call tosses,
quick, uh, opening plays.

733
00:50:14,734 --> 00:50:17,702
And O.J. could not catch a ball.

734
00:50:17,704 --> 00:50:21,872
He couldn't catch a ball if they paid
him to catch a ball, which they was.

735
00:50:21,874 --> 00:50:24,175
They was paying him.
They was paying him a lot.

736
00:50:38,091 --> 00:50:42,793
O.J. hated Buffalo. He hated the weather.

737
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:57,575
It's a blue collar town. Hard working,
blue collar, factory-working people.

738
00:50:57,577 --> 00:50:59,310
O.J. was nothing of that.

739
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,947
And plus, we was on a losing team.

740
00:51:07,487 --> 00:51:12,089
The first couple years of his pro
career were very frustrating for him,

741
00:51:12,091 --> 00:51:15,760
and they were disappointing
relative to the huge expectations

742
00:51:15,762 --> 00:51:17,695
that everybody set for him.

743
00:51:23,102 --> 00:51:24,802
I mean, they were saying he was a bust.

744
00:51:30,777 --> 00:51:34,679
If it had have stayed the same as it
was when he first got drafted in here,

745
00:51:34,681 --> 00:51:39,250
he would have been a nobody,
I honestly believe that.

746
00:51:39,252 --> 00:51:40,518
He'd have been a nobody.

747
00:51:49,028 --> 00:51:52,129
Best thing happened to O.J.
was John Rauch got fired,

748
00:51:52,131 --> 00:51:53,831
and Lou Saban took over.

749
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:57,868
Lou Saban was a person who
believed in the run game first,

750
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:59,103
the pass game second.

751
00:51:59,105 --> 00:52:01,205
I tell you, if Lou Saban
hadn't have came in,

752
00:52:01,207 --> 00:52:04,575
we wouldn't be doing this story right now.

753
00:52:11,551 --> 00:52:15,486
'73 was the year we
opened the new stadium.

754
00:52:15,488 --> 00:52:17,355
So we had a 80,000 seat stadium,

755
00:52:18,725 --> 00:52:23,194
and they brought in all
these young offensive linemen.

756
00:52:23,196 --> 00:52:25,730
Coach Saban built the team to run.

757
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:30,868
When I got there during exhibition season,

758
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:38,709
I saw him doing things that... I
said, "Wow. Homeboy's pretty bad."

759
00:52:38,711 --> 00:52:42,079
Lou Saban started selling them
on the idea that we can get 2,000.

760
00:52:42,081 --> 00:52:44,815
You can get 2,000. We can do this.

761
00:52:44,817 --> 00:52:48,619
You can get it done. What's
more, you gotta get it done.

762
00:52:55,995 --> 00:53:01,932
And in that first game,

763
00:53:01,934 --> 00:53:09,473
we turned out the lights and
started it and never looked back.

764
00:53:16,582 --> 00:53:21,585
First game I ever played in
the NFL, O.J. got 250 yards.

765
00:53:21,587 --> 00:53:24,688
O.J. Simpson could run sideways faster

766
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:27,458
than most men could run forward.

767
00:53:28,294 --> 00:53:30,227
And he hit the line, and he'd go

768
00:53:30,229 --> 00:53:33,998
that quick, then up the sideline.

769
00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:39,103
He was amazing.

770
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:44,375
I've been around a lot
of good ballplayers,

771
00:53:44,377 --> 00:53:48,746
but I've never been around
anyone that was as breathtaking

772
00:53:48,748 --> 00:53:51,782
or as captivating as he was.

773
00:53:51,784 --> 00:53:54,084
He would, like, glide.

774
00:53:54,086 --> 00:53:56,821
He never really picked his feet more
than a couple inches off the ground,

775
00:53:56,823 --> 00:53:59,790
so he was, like,
slithering through a hole.

776
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:01,559
When he'd hit a hole
sometimes he'd turn sideways

777
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:03,661
and kind of leap through it sideways.

778
00:54:03,663 --> 00:54:05,496
Then if he broke open into the open,

779
00:54:05,498 --> 00:54:07,665
then you'd start seeing the
knees go up in the stride.

780
00:54:07,667 --> 00:54:09,567
That's when he was buttery.

781
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:14,705
He's the one who sucked me
into being a rabid Bills fan.

782
00:54:16,409 --> 00:54:19,910
Let's hear it for the Bills.
Let's hear it. Come on! Let's go!

783
00:54:19,912 --> 00:54:21,178
Let's go, Bills!

784
00:54:25,585 --> 00:54:27,751
And once we got to the seventh game,

785
00:54:27,753 --> 00:54:34,058
it was a Monday night game,
O.J. went over a thousand.

786
00:54:37,196 --> 00:54:39,430
Everybody said, "Hey,
we have a shot at this."

787
00:54:41,968 --> 00:54:44,835
Two thousand yards in 14 games.

788
00:54:44,837 --> 00:54:48,873
That was like somebody breaking
Babe Ruth's home run record.

789
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:51,175
That was unheard of.

790
00:54:51,177 --> 00:54:53,210
What was going through
my mind at the time is

791
00:54:53,212 --> 00:54:55,212
he might have a chance of
breaking Jim Brown's record.

792
00:54:55,214 --> 00:54:57,281
I never thought that
he would go 2,000 yards.

793
00:54:57,283 --> 00:54:59,617
Why are you so much
better than everybody else?

794
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:03,187
I think... I think the offensive
line is so much better than everybody.

795
00:55:03,189 --> 00:55:06,223
Hey, you guys!

796
00:55:08,394 --> 00:55:10,728
We're gonna turn it on.

797
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:13,297
All of a sudden, we got a
nickname: "The Electric Company."

798
00:55:13,299 --> 00:55:16,033
And, wow, this is pretty cool.

799
00:55:16,035 --> 00:55:19,470
The nickname came from the
PR director of The Bills.

800
00:55:19,472 --> 00:55:22,740
There used to be a cartoon
called The Electric Company,

801
00:55:22,742 --> 00:55:25,809
and his son watched it all the time.

802
00:55:25,811 --> 00:55:28,812
He said, "Hey, Dad, why don't you
call 'em 'The Electric Company'?"

803
00:55:28,814 --> 00:55:31,532

he was gonna go for 2,000.

819
00:56:16,462 --> 00:56:20,965
With only, uh, two games to go, he
was still 400 and a few yards short.

820
00:56:20,967 --> 00:56:22,399
Go, Juice!

821
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:23,200
Come on, Juice!

822
00:56:25,438 --> 00:56:31,308
During the games, I never took
a minute off from the offense.

823
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:34,778
♪ Do you want The Juice
to put a move on you? ♪

824
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,747
I never made it to the bench.

825
00:56:36,749 --> 00:56:38,282
♪ Turn on The Juice ♪

826
00:56:38,284 --> 00:56:39,450
♪ Yeah ♪

827
00:56:39,452 --> 00:56:40,985
I didn't wanna miss any of it.

828
00:56:40,987 --> 00:56:44,421
♪ Turn on The Juice ♪

829
00:56:44,423 --> 00:56:47,791
It was the most exciting
thing that I'd ever seen.

830
00:56:47,793 --> 00:56:50,427
♪ Turn on The Juice ♪

831
00:56:50,429 --> 00:56:51,996
♪ Yeah ♪

832
00:57:05,811 --> 00:57:09,513
When we got to New York, that last game,

833
00:57:09,515 --> 00:57:11,315
he was going for Jim Brown's record.

834
00:57:13,419 --> 00:57:17,187
With 60 yards needed, and everyone knew

835
00:57:17,189 --> 00:57:22,159
that The Jets didn't want
him to get the record.

836
00:57:22,161 --> 00:57:27,998
I was actually there. The Jets had
no chance of making the playoffs.

837
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,134
The only interesting thing about that day

838
00:57:30,136 --> 00:57:32,569
was whether O.J. was going to break 2,000.

839
00:57:34,874 --> 00:57:38,509
It was a really snowy, cold day.

840
00:57:38,511 --> 00:57:41,178
Hm, a little bit similar to today.

841
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,479
So a lot of people were worried

842
00:57:42,481 --> 00:57:44,114
that he wouldn't have
a lot of rushing yards

843
00:57:44,116 --> 00:57:47,651
because of that, a lot
of slipping in the snow.

844
00:57:47,653 --> 00:57:50,120
He was nervous that day.

845
00:57:50,122 --> 00:57:53,057
We had a little chat,
and I told him, I said,

846
00:57:53,059 --> 00:57:57,294
"Hey, homes, this is just
another week for you."

847
00:57:57,296 --> 00:58:01,098
I think he knew that "This
is gonna make or break me."

848
00:58:02,968 --> 00:58:07,171
He knew that in order for him
to write his name in the book,

849
00:58:07,173 --> 00:58:10,140
he had to be exceptional.

850
00:58:10,142 --> 00:58:13,010
He was living a very comfortable life,

851
00:58:13,012 --> 00:58:15,946
but he wanted to live an exceptional life,

852
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:21,218
and this was his exceptional feat.

853
00:58:30,596 --> 00:58:33,497
I remember just about
every play in that game.

854
00:58:33,499 --> 00:58:34,832
Every time Simpson got the ball,

855
00:58:34,834 --> 00:58:38,035
everyone was rushing to their,
uh, notepad to write it down.

856
00:58:38,037 --> 00:58:41,705
And the announcers kept counting it down.

857
00:58:41,707 --> 00:58:45,008
Well, gentlemen, we are coming
upon it, and, uh, The Juice should

858
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:49,613
break the National Football League
rushing record in this next series.

859
00:58:49,615 --> 00:58:53,417
Simpson running left, Simpson
breaking loose, and there it is!

860
00:58:53,419 --> 00:58:58,355
All right! All right!

861
00:58:58,357 --> 00:59:00,224
He needed four yards, he
got five and this crowd,

862
00:59:00,226 --> 00:59:04,962
his whole team is gathering
around and congratulating him,

863
00:59:04,964 --> 00:59:09,099
hitting him on the head, there
isn't a person sitting down.

864
00:59:09,101 --> 00:59:12,469
He got the 1,863 pretty early in the game.

865
00:59:12,471 --> 00:59:14,872
And they said, "Okay, now
we're going for the 2,000."

866
00:59:14,874 --> 00:59:18,308
And now it's for the 2,000, Floyd.

867
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,714
More than 100 yards,
O.J., O.J. cuts inside,

868
00:59:23,716 --> 00:59:26,583
O.J. gets wide, this is on!

869
00:59:26,585 --> 00:59:31,221
Now a race he's at midfield and he's
inside Jets territory at the 43 yard line.

870
00:59:31,223 --> 00:59:35,726
100 yards. How many games did
he get to 100 yards? Eleven?

871
00:59:35,728 --> 00:59:37,461
Once he got over 100 yards,

872
00:59:37,463 --> 00:59:39,329
a different excitement
started to hit the game.

873
00:59:39,331 --> 00:59:42,666
Well, he might do this. He
might actually hit 2,000.

874
00:59:42,668 --> 00:59:47,104
You had Jets fans who were
basically rooting for O.J.

875
00:59:47,106 --> 00:59:50,007
because they wanted to be part
of history, and I think, you know,

876
00:59:50,009 --> 00:59:52,676
I was basically a little kid,
but I think I felt that way.

877
00:59:52,678 --> 00:59:53,577
Who cared if The Jets won?

878
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:55,078
Everybody loved O.J.

879
01:00:00,286 --> 01:00:05,155
O.J., he's got five yards,
and O.J. running left,

880
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:08,525
O.J. five more. Maybe more. I don't know.

881
01:00:08,527 --> 01:00:14,198
They did it. They did it. Yeah!

882
01:00:15,968 --> 01:00:20,070
And when he did it, he was on my shoulder.

883
01:00:22,141 --> 01:00:28,846
I knew how important it was.
I contributed to that also.

884
01:00:28,848 --> 01:00:32,182
The defense has to give
the ball to the offense.

885
01:00:32,184 --> 01:00:35,385
I felt it. It was mine, too.

886
01:00:38,691 --> 01:00:42,226
Right after the game, there's
"Gotta get O.J. to the interview,"

887
01:00:42,228 --> 01:00:45,229
and he said, "I'm not coming in
unless you bring in all the guys."

888
01:00:45,231 --> 01:00:48,699
And we were in a tiny room. We
could barely fit in that room.

889
01:00:48,701 --> 01:00:52,202
He brought in all the offense. He
refused to go in that room without us.

890
01:00:52,204 --> 01:00:55,138
O.J., you brought 'em all with you.

891
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,074
Yeah. Hey, they did the job, all of you.

892
01:00:57,076 --> 01:00:58,175
I want you to meet the boys. Here.

893
01:00:58,177 --> 01:01:01,078
Mike Montler, our... our... our center.

894
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,780
Jim Braxton, Bob Penchion, Joe Ferguson.

895
01:01:03,782 --> 01:01:05,682
Didn't throw many passes this year,
but ball-handling is the thing.

896
01:01:07,152 --> 01:01:10,554
Donnie Green, Bobby
Chandler, Paul Seymour,

897
01:01:10,556 --> 01:01:12,256
Dave Foley, a former Jet.

898
01:01:13,425 --> 01:01:14,858
All right, all right!

899
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:17,427
This is a guy, through the long winter

900
01:01:17,429 --> 01:01:19,062
wasn't supposed to play
any football this year.

901
01:01:19,064 --> 01:01:20,998
He had a heart problem, but you
came back, and you see what we did.

902
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,334
JD Hill, "Crackback" Hill,
my main man Reg McKenzie.

903
01:01:24,336 --> 01:01:27,004
He was the most generous
guy you'd ever meet.

904
01:01:29,008 --> 01:01:31,675
When we broke the record, he
bought us a gold wristband.

905
01:01:31,677 --> 01:01:35,679
And on the back of it is,
"We did it. The Juice. 3088."

906
01:01:35,681 --> 01:01:38,749
He didn't say "2003", he said "3088",

907
01:01:38,751 --> 01:01:40,918
because that's how much the team rushed.

908
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,787
I hope to stay in the, uh, league
long enough for, uh, you know,

909
01:01:43,789 --> 01:01:46,056
'til all these guys
get old so no young back

910
01:01:46,058 --> 01:01:48,158
can get behind 'em and break my record.

911
01:01:49,929 --> 01:01:53,330
'73 was like a rebirth of his celebrity.

912
01:01:58,137 --> 01:02:00,103
I was 22 years old, I thought, you know,

913
01:02:00,105 --> 01:02:03,206
"This is like being on
a team with Babe Ruth."

914
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:07,210
Mentally, I think he was
ahead of, uh, a lot of people.

915
01:02:07,212 --> 01:02:12,382
From watching how he handled
himself, how he operated,

916
01:02:12,384 --> 01:02:17,688
my whole demeanor changed.
I began to wanna be like O.J.

917
01:02:20,492 --> 01:02:26,463
He was Baryshnikov. When somebody
is that great at something,

918
01:02:28,767 --> 01:02:32,736
when we see those
people, they are special.

919
01:02:35,107 --> 01:02:39,076
They just can do stuff
that other people can't do.

920
01:02:44,683 --> 01:02:49,920
You expect it of yourself. You hear
the crowd, but you don't hear it.

921
01:02:49,922 --> 01:02:54,257
I mean, you know they're cheering,
but that's the way it should be.

922
01:02:54,259 --> 01:02:58,328
When I'm in the open, I'm running,
this is how it is supposed to be.

923
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:02,366
This is correct. This is
the natural state of things.

924
01:03:02,368 --> 01:03:06,336
I know whenever I've done it,
my feelings have always been,

925
01:03:06,338 --> 01:03:08,872
uh, that's nothing.
Uh, this is nothing yet.

926
01:03:08,874 --> 01:03:10,340
Yeah, I'm gonna do it again.

927
01:03:12,878 --> 01:03:17,280
Orenthal James Simpson had that shine.

928
01:03:17,282 --> 01:03:20,784
The sun hit him, and there
was this thing about him.

929
01:03:20,786 --> 01:03:22,719
Because he really was that great.

930
01:03:22,721 --> 01:03:25,455
He really was that great.

931
01:03:28,027 --> 01:03:31,728
Football has been my vehicle
to come out of the ghetto,

932
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:35,966
uh, to give everything I've got.
I think I have a lot more to offer.

933
01:03:35,968 --> 01:03:38,335
There's a lot of things
I need as a person.

934
01:03:38,337 --> 01:03:41,905
You know, I need, uh...
I need that recognition.

935
01:03:41,907 --> 01:03:44,841
I think that, uh, what...
what is driving O.J. Simpson

936
01:03:44,843 --> 01:03:48,378
is that need to be number
one, that need to be liked.

937
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:51,882
That need to be said,
"Hey, that's O.J. Simpson."

938
01:03:51,884 --> 01:03:56,153
When I walk down the street,
I want people to know me.

939
01:04:09,768 --> 01:04:16,206
♪ Let Hertz put you in the driver's seat ♪

940
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:17,407
♪ Let Hertz take you anywhere ♪

941
01:04:17,409 --> 01:04:20,243
We had done a survey
asking the customer base

942
01:04:20,245 --> 01:04:24,881
what was the most important attribute
of the rental car experience?

943
01:04:24,883 --> 01:04:26,316
And the most important
attribute was speed of service.

944
01:04:30,355 --> 01:04:34,357
So we went to the agency,
and they showed a storyboard

945
01:04:34,359 --> 01:04:40,030
of a businessman with a briefcase
running through the airport.

946
01:04:40,032 --> 01:04:43,600
Our marketing guy said,
"Frank, it doesn't work.

947
01:04:43,602 --> 01:04:47,604
That's not realistic to think
a businessman's gonna do that.

948
01:04:47,606 --> 01:04:50,474
We need somebody that connotes speed."

949
01:04:50,476 --> 01:04:54,978
And I said, "Like what?" He
says, "Like O.J. Simpson."

950
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:57,948
Juice comes off the blocks,
immediately goes into the lead.

951
01:04:57,950 --> 01:04:59,382
Steve Smith running in second place.

952
01:04:59,384 --> 01:05:01,651
Right now it's Mark Gleason,
but here comes Hancock.

953
01:05:01,653 --> 01:05:03,120
He moves past Gleason.

954
01:05:03,122 --> 01:05:06,056
O.J. looks back, sees Smith
running at his shoulder,

955
01:05:06,058 --> 01:05:08,825
steps on it a little bit,
and The Juice puts him away.

956
01:05:08,827 --> 01:05:10,427
It was one of the clients who said,

957
01:05:10,429 --> 01:05:14,131
"Did you see the ABC
program The Superstars ?

958
01:05:14,133 --> 01:05:16,733
O.J. just lit up the screen.

959
01:05:16,735 --> 01:05:20,971
His personality came out, and
he just made everybody smile."

960
01:05:20,973 --> 01:05:22,606
You gave him about a yard and
then you took a look at him.

961
01:05:22,608 --> 01:05:23,940
What's happening?

962
01:05:23,942 --> 01:05:26,510
Well, I was out there cruising.
I figure I'd coast it on in.

963
01:05:26,512 --> 01:05:30,413
I saw Steve pull up on me, you know,
and my ego got a little ruffled there.

964
01:05:30,415 --> 01:05:32,149
I said, "I'd better
get out in front again."

965
01:05:32,151 --> 01:05:35,152
I called him, and his first comment was,

966
01:05:35,154 --> 01:05:37,087
"Hertz is the number
one rent-a-car company.

967
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:41,191
If I'm ever going to do anything
in advertising in a big way,

968
01:05:41,193 --> 01:05:43,693
it's always gonna be for
the number one brand."

969
01:05:43,695 --> 01:05:46,029
When you're in a rush,
take it from O.J. Simpson.

970
01:05:46,031 --> 01:05:48,832
There's only one superstar
in rent-a-car: Hertz.

971
01:05:48,834 --> 01:05:51,835
The first ad was filmed in Newark Airport.

972
01:05:51,837 --> 01:05:53,770
He was very professional,

973
01:05:53,772 --> 01:05:58,008
he was anxious to make sure
that he did things correctly,

974
01:05:58,010 --> 01:05:59,843
that his diction was appropriate.

975
01:05:59,845 --> 01:06:03,313
Others claim to be fast, but
nobody has more to do it faster.

976
01:06:03,315 --> 01:06:06,216
More pros to execute the
toughest performance standards.

977
01:06:06,218 --> 01:06:09,719
More cars, more locations, first with
every good idea to speed up service,

978
01:06:09,721 --> 01:06:11,688
like the Number One Club.

979
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:15,959
Before you get there, your form's
filled out, car's preassigned.

980
01:06:15,961 --> 01:06:17,594
Go, O.J., go!

981
01:06:18,997 --> 01:06:23,133
Rent a Ford fast from Hertz,
the superstar in rent-a-car.

982
01:06:23,135 --> 01:06:27,070
I thought it was perfect.
I mean, it just made sense.

983
01:06:27,072 --> 01:06:30,240
You're trying to portray speed of service,

984
01:06:30,242 --> 01:06:34,744
and you've got the fastest guy in
America running through the airport

985
01:06:34,746 --> 01:06:37,581
and a little old lady yelling, "Go, O.J.!"

986
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,149
Go, O.J., go!

987
01:06:39,151 --> 01:06:40,283
It was perfect.

988
01:06:42,187 --> 01:06:47,090
It tested so well that they decided
to use him for the print work,

989
01:06:47,092 --> 01:06:50,227
promotional work, and
they did the right thing.

990
01:06:50,229 --> 01:06:53,330
He made that company successful.

991
01:06:53,332 --> 01:06:56,166
He became the image for that company.

992
01:06:56,168 --> 01:06:58,401
We started in September of '75.

993
01:06:58,403 --> 01:07:01,938
By two years of the campaign
running, O.J. Simpson

994
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:05,208
was the star presenter of
the year for Advertising Age.

995
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:08,612
There was never a story
that was written about O.J.

996
01:07:08,614 --> 01:07:09,446
that didn't mention Hertz.

997
01:07:10,949 --> 01:07:14,417
Coming or going on a business
trip, you've got no time to waste.

998
01:07:14,419 --> 01:07:17,087
I can see him right now
flying through the airport.

999
01:07:17,089 --> 01:07:18,888
Whether it's picking up or dropping off...

1000
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:22,092
I was proud. It made me want that.

1001
01:07:22,094 --> 01:07:25,228
Go, O.J., go!

1002
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:26,796
It gave me hope.

1003
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:29,633
There you are with super-speed

1004
01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:31,401
This is an important moment.

1005
01:07:31,403 --> 01:07:34,738
The young black kid seeing a
black man running on television.

1006
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:37,407
That's all he sees. He says,
"He looks like my uncle Reggie."

1007
01:07:37,409 --> 01:07:38,908
You know it.

1008
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:43,313
That's something I could do. I
wanna be like O.J. on television.

1009
01:07:43,315 --> 01:07:45,448
Hi. Ever need to rent a car fast? Watch.

1010
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:49,486
You're in the limelight. We like
seeing you. You look like us.

1011
01:07:49,488 --> 01:07:50,787
It's kind of like when
I first saw black people

1012
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:52,255
brushing their teeth on TV.

1013
01:07:52,257 --> 01:07:54,257
I mean, we always knew
we brushed our teeth,

1014
01:07:54,259 --> 01:07:56,626
but it was, like, a big
thing. Like, "Come see!"

1015
01:07:56,628 --> 01:07:59,562
That's what happened with O.J. Simpson.

1016
01:07:59,564 --> 01:08:03,833
Those were heights that we had not
reached before, so he was a pioneer.

1017
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:09,773
You're a black man in America,
you're fighting our war.

1018
01:08:09,775 --> 01:08:14,477
If you make a success for yourself
somewhere, you've opened a door.

1019
01:08:14,479 --> 01:08:17,414
Fortunately, because of
the riots of the early '60s,

1020
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:19,649
some doors were opened to me.

1021
01:08:19,651 --> 01:08:22,352
If I were to have looked at myself
in any other way except a man,

1022
01:08:22,354 --> 01:08:23,853
my brother could walk into a room and know

1023
01:08:23,855 --> 01:08:25,789
he's the only black guy in the room.

1024
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:27,157
I walk in a room, and I don't care.

1025
01:08:27,159 --> 01:08:29,326
I don't count the blacks
or whites in the room,

1026
01:08:29,328 --> 01:08:33,096
and in '68, when I signed to work
for some white companies, you know,

1027
01:08:33,098 --> 01:08:35,532
Chevrolet Motor Division,
I walked in the room,

1028
01:08:35,534 --> 01:08:37,701
and I never thought that I was
the first black guy to do it.

1029
01:08:37,703 --> 01:08:40,337
I never even gave that any credence.

1030
01:08:40,339 --> 01:08:42,839
For us, O.J. was colorless.

1031
01:08:42,841 --> 01:08:49,346
None of the people that we associated
with looked at him as a black man.

1032
01:08:50,949 --> 01:08:56,119
O.J. portrayed success.

1033
01:08:56,121 --> 01:09:02,292
Success, I mean, from nowhere. And
I think people want to be successful.

1034
01:09:02,294 --> 01:09:06,062
O.J. was the first to
demonstrate that white folks

1035
01:09:06,064 --> 01:09:10,500
would buy stuff based
on a black endorsement

1036
01:09:10,502 --> 01:09:16,740
as long as it was not pressed
as a black endorsement.

1037
01:09:16,742 --> 01:09:20,577
And the way they did that
was to remove black people

1038
01:09:20,579 --> 01:09:26,049
totally from any scene that O.J. was in.

1039
01:09:27,185 --> 01:09:29,152
It was Fred Levinson who said,

1040
01:09:29,154 --> 01:09:32,689
"Guys, we're going to
be showing a black man

1041
01:09:32,691 --> 01:09:35,992
running through an airport in 1975."

1042
01:09:35,994 --> 01:09:38,261
I said, "When you see the
commercial with a black guy

1043
01:09:38,263 --> 01:09:40,997
running through an
airport, a little different

1044
01:09:40,999 --> 01:09:43,066
than seeing a white guy
running through an airport."

1045
01:09:43,068 --> 01:09:46,770
So he came up with the idea of
putting in various characters

1046
01:09:46,772 --> 01:09:51,841
who would see O.J. and endorse
him by saying, "Go, O.J., go!"

1047
01:09:51,843 --> 01:09:53,510
Go, O.J., go!

1048
01:09:53,512 --> 01:09:55,879
Go, O.J., go!

1049
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:57,781
Go, Juice, go!

1050
01:09:57,783 --> 01:09:59,282
Rent a Ford from Hertz.

1051
01:09:59,284 --> 01:10:00,550
The superstar in rent-a-car.

1052
01:10:00,552 --> 01:10:01,851
Right.

1053
01:10:02,921 --> 01:10:05,355
They bought the notion

1054
01:10:05,357 --> 01:10:10,026
that you could erase the
black character, the culture.

1055
01:10:10,028 --> 01:10:12,195
This is what made O.J. marketable.

1056
01:10:13,231 --> 01:10:16,199
He's African, but he's a good-looking man.

1057
01:10:16,201 --> 01:10:19,369
You know, he almost has white features.

1058
01:10:19,371 --> 01:10:23,773
He wasn't the typical
black look, African look.

1059
01:10:23,775 --> 01:10:25,909
What white America got out of it

1060
01:10:25,911 --> 01:10:31,714
was they could point to
somebody that had "made it"

1061
01:10:33,418 --> 01:10:37,454
and demonstrated unequivocally
that we are more than willing

1062
01:10:37,456 --> 01:10:41,124
to not just accept
you, but to embrace you.

1063
01:10:42,961 --> 01:10:49,966

We were at Bob Kardasian's
mansion in Beverly Hills.

1144
01:15:01,419 --> 01:15:06,055
O.J. is playing tennis, and
everybody's having a good time.

1145
01:15:06,057 --> 01:15:08,524
I'm with black power, get it?

1146
01:15:08,526 --> 01:15:11,394
I don't wanna be around
these people, all right?

1147
01:15:11,396 --> 01:15:14,230
'Cause they're all phony to me.

1148
01:15:14,232 --> 01:15:17,066
I said, "O.J., look around you, man.

1149
01:15:17,068 --> 01:15:19,435
These people don't care nothing about us.

1150
01:15:19,437 --> 01:15:25,074
Just a few years ago, these
guys woulda drove down Fillmore

1151
01:15:25,076 --> 01:15:30,913
in their Rolls Royce and they
wouldn't have even spit on us."

1152
01:15:30,915 --> 01:15:35,384
I said, "Now they're acting like
we're their long-lost brothers."

1153
01:15:35,386 --> 01:15:39,388
I said, "Man, the only reason
we're here is we are jocks,

1154
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:41,357
and you're O.J.."

1155
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:46,629
And he looked at me,
he says, "Mm-hm, yeah."

1156
01:15:46,631 --> 01:15:49,132
He says, "I understand
what you're saying,"

1157
01:15:49,134 --> 01:15:51,601
and he rubbed his tennis racket.

1158
01:15:51,603 --> 01:15:58,708
He says, "But I am O.J.," and
ran off on the field laughing.

1159
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:02,278
And I was, like, I mean, I was furious.

1160
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:06,415
Because I say, "He's lost.
He's lost his identity.

1161
01:16:06,417 --> 01:16:09,051
He doesn't know who he is any longer."

1162
01:16:11,556 --> 01:16:15,491
I think he'd been brainwashed.

1163
01:16:15,493 --> 01:16:18,761
Let me read you something
that he said to me.

1164
01:16:18,763 --> 01:16:20,630
"That sort of thing hurts me

1165
01:16:20,632 --> 01:16:24,801
even though it's what I
strive for, to be a man first.

1166
01:16:24,803 --> 01:16:27,937
Maybe it's money, a class thing.

1167
01:16:27,939 --> 01:16:30,606
The negro is always
identified with poverty.

1168
01:16:30,608 --> 01:16:37,280
But then you think of Willy Mays
as black, but not Bill Cosby.

1169
01:16:37,282 --> 01:16:39,315
So it's more than just money.

1170
01:16:39,317 --> 01:16:42,185
As black men, we need something
up there all the time for us,

1171
01:16:42,187 --> 01:16:46,756
but what I'm doing is not for
principles or black people.

1172
01:16:46,758 --> 01:16:54,197
No. I'm dealing first for O.J.
Simpson, his wife and his babies."

1173
01:16:55,667 --> 01:17:03,372
O.J.'s quest was to erase race
as a defining factor in his life,

1174
01:17:03,374 --> 01:17:08,044
and that was the basis
upon which white society

1175
01:17:08,046 --> 01:17:11,347
not only accepted him, but embraced him.

1176
01:17:14,552 --> 01:17:18,287
Now, there are problems with that,

1177
01:17:18,289 --> 01:17:23,326
because what enabled O.J.
to be O.J. and not be black

1178
01:17:23,328 --> 01:17:27,663
was that so many negroes
and black people stood up,

1179
01:17:27,665 --> 01:17:31,734
made the sacrifice, paid the price.

1180
01:17:31,736 --> 01:17:36,372
They're the ones that set the table
for O.J. and what he was saying was,

1181
01:17:36,374 --> 01:17:40,243
"Okay. We may not have
arrived, but I have arrived,

1182
01:17:40,245 --> 01:17:42,044
and as far as I'm concerned,

1183
01:17:42,046 --> 01:17:44,347
everybody else can get here
the same way that I did,

1184
01:17:44,349 --> 01:17:47,383
and when they get here,
they can do what I do."

1185
01:17:47,385 --> 01:17:50,386
He was so privileged, he was so accepted,

1186
01:17:50,388 --> 01:17:56,259
he was so embraced that he
was immune from the reality

1187
01:17:56,261 --> 01:18:00,663
that he could find in the mirror
every morning that he was a black man.

1188
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:06,669
No matter how far he
runs and how long he runs,

1189
01:18:06,671 --> 01:18:09,205
when you look in the mirror,

1190
01:18:09,207 --> 01:18:15,077
that black man is gonna be
right there with you. Every day.

1191
01:18:22,587 --> 01:18:25,721
We were just sitting around
the house once and, uh, he says,

1192
01:18:25,723 --> 01:18:29,759
"Joe, do you think you could go back?"

1193
01:18:29,761 --> 01:18:32,194
And I was like, "Go back where?"

1194
01:18:32,196 --> 01:18:35,464
He said, "You know, go back
to the projects, hanging out?"

1195
01:18:35,466 --> 01:18:38,935
I said, "Yeah, man." I said,
"I could go back tomorrow."

1196
01:18:48,379 --> 01:18:54,050
Potrero Hill. Hasn't changed a bit.

1197
01:18:59,757 --> 01:19:04,460
We didn't have Dr. King and these
other bougie folks as role models.

1198
01:19:04,462 --> 01:19:08,164
Our role models was pimps and players.

1199
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:11,901
Those are the only people
that we looked up to,

1200
01:19:11,903 --> 01:19:13,836
because they had cool things.

1201
01:19:15,406 --> 01:19:21,010
They'd beat a ho down right there
on the street in front of everybody

1202
01:19:21,012 --> 01:19:22,678
so that all the women would know it,

1203
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,447
this is the kind of
treatment you're gonna get

1204
01:19:24,449 --> 01:19:26,349
if you don't bring me my money.

1205
01:19:28,686 --> 01:19:34,190
Your perceptions are shaped by
the men that are in your lives.

1206
01:19:34,192 --> 01:19:38,995
Mama was Mama. We knew she
loved us, but the reality is

1207
01:19:38,997 --> 01:19:43,599
I didn't wanna be like Mama.
Mama's a woman. I want to be a man.

1208
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:48,938
He had to deal with his
father from time to time.

1209
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:51,440
Sometimes, I guess his father came by

1210
01:19:51,442 --> 01:19:54,176
to take care of the
monthly payment or whatever.

1211
01:19:56,848 --> 01:20:02,718
One day, we went over to his dad's
house. We knocked on the door.

1212
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:06,956
He kept looking at me, and
when his dad opened the door,

1213
01:20:06,958 --> 01:20:11,027
he was in a bathrobe,
which is not a crime,

1214
01:20:11,029 --> 01:20:14,864
but then his dad kinda
opened the door more,

1215
01:20:14,866 --> 01:20:17,500
and there was a guy in
the back in a bathrobe too,

1216
01:20:17,502 --> 01:20:21,437
so it was obvious that his dad was gay.

1217
01:20:22,807 --> 01:20:26,675
We left and on the way
back, we were quiet.

1218
01:20:26,677 --> 01:20:32,081
Because there was so much tension,
we got to this certain point,

1219
01:20:32,083 --> 01:20:33,916
and we both bust out laughing.

1220
01:20:33,918 --> 01:20:37,386
Calvin came to me, and he was like,

1221
01:20:37,388 --> 01:20:43,092
"Man, did you know O.J.'s dad is a punk?"

1222
01:20:43,094 --> 01:20:49,532
I was like, "Man, shut up.
I don't wanna hear that."

1223
01:20:49,534 --> 01:20:52,368
Back in our day that was
the worst thing in the world.

1224
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:55,738
That you could ever think
about an African-American man

1225
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:57,740
being a homosexual.

1226
01:20:57,742 --> 01:20:59,341
Did you ever talk to O.J. about this?

1227
01:20:59,343 --> 01:21:00,009
No.

1228
01:21:00,011 --> 01:21:01,610
Never?

1229
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:11,253
Mm-mm. I felt like that issue was
enough for him to deal with himself.

1230
01:21:13,257 --> 01:21:17,726
Think of O.J. as an American man,

1231
01:21:17,728 --> 01:21:21,530
a poor American man, tough American man,

1232
01:21:21,532 --> 01:21:29,105
who's recreating himself in ways
that people would accept and push.

1233
01:21:34,712 --> 01:21:38,380
O.J. Simpson may be playing the last
game of his brilliant football career

1234
01:21:38,382 --> 01:21:40,950
tomorrow when the Buffalo Bills
meet the Minnesota Vikings.

1235
01:21:40,952 --> 01:21:44,720
All year, O.J. has hinted he may
hang up his cleats for a movie career.

1236
01:21:47,291 --> 01:21:51,627
He could not wait to get out of Buffalo.

1237
01:21:51,629 --> 01:21:52,895
He was away from the glamour.

1238
01:21:52,897 --> 01:21:55,131
He was away from all the
Hollywood and all that stuff.

1239
01:21:56,601 --> 01:22:01,570
He got attention here, but it
was a different kind of attention.

1240
01:22:01,572 --> 01:22:04,473
It was not Hollywood attention.

1241
01:22:06,077 --> 01:22:09,845
Lou Saban said today that he's
detected a change in The Juice.

1242
01:22:09,847 --> 01:22:12,748
He hasn't diminished
one whit as a competitor,

1243
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:14,250
but he's an intelligent man,

1244
01:22:14,252 --> 01:22:17,953
and he's thinking about the
whole of his future life.

1245
01:22:17,955 --> 01:22:20,823
There are certain opportunities
outside of football

1246
01:22:20,825 --> 01:22:24,827
that I can't, uh... I just can't
overlook too... too many more years.

1247
01:22:24,829 --> 01:22:27,329
You know, I came into the league,
I thought the world was mine.

1248
01:22:27,331 --> 01:22:29,832
I had a few bad years,
and I realized then that

1249
01:22:29,834 --> 01:22:31,367
"Hey, you know, when
you're hot you're hot,"

1250
01:22:31,369 --> 01:22:34,136
so there's opportunities
that have come to me with ABC,

1251
01:22:34,138 --> 01:22:36,805
with the movies that I would
like to, uh, take advantage of

1252
01:22:36,807 --> 01:22:39,375
and, uh, the only thing I
wanna do right now is play...

1253
01:22:39,377 --> 01:22:42,444
Get the best possible year
I can so if I do retire...

1254
01:22:42,446 --> 01:22:44,813
I... I will feel that
I gave it my all and I,

1255
01:22:44,815 --> 01:22:46,348
you know, uh, went out the best.

1256
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:50,219
That's your own meretricious
way of saying you want my job.

1257
01:22:50,221 --> 01:22:51,887
Well, you gotta explain
meretricious to me, Howard.

1258
01:22:54,492 --> 01:22:59,395
I always felt that there was
more underneath O.J. Simpson

1259
01:22:59,397 --> 01:23:03,866
than just the momentary
superficiality of his pleasantness.

1260
01:23:06,204 --> 01:23:09,138
He had goals that he wanted to achieve,

1261
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,739
and he internalized those things.

1262
01:23:12,009 --> 01:23:15,644
There was something driving
him, and I always felt

1263
01:23:15,646 --> 01:23:19,014
that he was looking
past a football career,

1264
01:23:19,016 --> 01:23:21,917
which was going to
definitely come to an end.

1265
01:23:23,421 --> 01:23:29,658
We are T-minus 18 seconds from
liftoff. We are T-minus 15 seconds.

1266
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:31,227
Would you and your men please follow me?

1267
01:23:31,229 --> 01:23:32,494
Gary, what the hell is this?

1268
01:23:32,496 --> 01:23:34,697
This is an emergency.
Please follow me now!

1269
01:23:34,699 --> 01:23:37,900
One of the most intriguing films
now being put together in Hollywood

1270
01:23:37,902 --> 01:23:39,501
is Capricorn One.

1271
01:23:39,503 --> 01:23:43,405
James Brolin plays the first
astronaut to set foot on Mars,

1272
01:23:43,407 --> 01:23:47,076
but the picture's scene-stealer
will probably be O.J. Simpson.

1273
01:23:47,078 --> 01:23:51,280
It basically came from the studio
that they wanted O.J. Simpson.

1274
01:23:51,282 --> 01:23:56,752
I thought there were worthy
African-American actors

1275
01:23:56,754 --> 01:24:00,556
who had paid their dues as
actors, who had shown their talent.

1276
01:24:00,558 --> 01:24:03,792
My first choice was either
Robert Hooks or Bernie Casey,

1277
01:24:03,794 --> 01:24:08,330
so my reaction was less than enthusiastic.

1278
01:24:11,402 --> 01:24:13,402
I had seen Towering Inferno.

1279
01:24:13,404 --> 01:24:17,106
What? Damn it, man, you
shoulda sent a man up there.

1280
01:24:17,108 --> 01:24:19,742
How do you expect her to
hear a phone call? She's deaf.

1281
01:24:19,744 --> 01:24:22,111
I thought he was not gonna
frighten Daniel Day-Lewis.

1282
01:24:23,914 --> 01:24:28,384
O.J. was a celebrity of enormous stature,

1283
01:24:28,386 --> 01:24:32,087
and somebody who had not shown
the chops to play the part.

1284
01:24:32,089 --> 01:24:34,823
How uptight do you get making
a picture like Capricorn One

1285
01:24:34,825 --> 01:24:38,260
where you're working in the company
of actors of... of real stature and...

1286
01:24:38,262 --> 01:24:40,496
and you're just a football
star trying to be an actor?

1287
01:24:40,498 --> 01:24:43,832
No, I don't think, uh, it's
given me that... that feeling.

1288
01:24:43,834 --> 01:24:45,467
It's obviously given me the feeling that,

1289
01:24:45,469 --> 01:24:46,969
"Hey, I've still got a lot to learn."

1290
01:24:46,971 --> 01:24:49,672
I think, uh, you never
stop learning in anything,

1291
01:24:49,674 --> 01:24:53,642
and I... I realize I'm still just
a babe, you know, in the woods.

1292
01:24:53,644 --> 01:24:59,915
My goal was to see if I could make
this guy work for what I wanted.

1293
01:24:59,917 --> 01:25:02,418
Came time to do his last scene.

1294
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:09,992
Water. Tiny says signs for water.

1295
01:25:09,994 --> 01:25:13,829
He's a guy who's parched and delusional.

1296
01:25:13,831 --> 01:25:16,965
Dry river bed. Signs.

1297
01:25:16,967 --> 01:25:19,835
And so rather than him acting somebody

1298
01:25:19,837 --> 01:25:21,503
who was desperately thirsty...

1299
01:25:21,505 --> 01:25:23,839
... more sign.

1300
01:25:23,841 --> 01:25:27,209
I put appliances on his face that
made it difficult for him to move

1301
01:25:27,211 --> 01:25:32,014
and difficult to talk,
and it just made him sound

1302
01:25:32,016 --> 01:25:34,149
like he was in desperate trouble.

1303
01:25:34,151 --> 01:25:37,619
Elizabeth, there's no water.

1304
01:25:37,621 --> 01:25:46,662
- There's no water.
- I don't want to die.

1305
01:25:46,664 --> 01:25:48,831
And, uh, he was pretty good.

1306
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:50,299
Elizabeth.

1307
01:25:50,301 --> 01:25:53,369
You know, at the... at
the... What could I say?

1308
01:25:53,371 --> 01:25:56,038
He was a charming, terrific guy.

1309
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,842
He was a positive guy. He tried very hard,

1310
01:25:59,844 --> 01:26:05,047
and it was clear that he saw
a future for himself in film.

1311
01:26:22,566 --> 01:26:25,434
The Daisy was a private
club in Beverly Hills,

1312
01:26:25,436 --> 01:26:27,703
and the only people that could get in it

1313
01:26:27,705 --> 01:26:30,539
were either rich, famous or beautiful.

1314
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:35,711
All the celebrities used to go
there. And really beautiful girls.

1315
01:26:35,713 --> 01:26:39,448
And you could get in even if
you were underage, no problem.

1316
01:26:41,452 --> 01:26:45,687
Jack Hanson started the disco,
and he knew every Hollywood star.

1317
01:26:45,689 --> 01:26:48,690
Jack was a former USC guy.

1318
01:26:48,692 --> 01:26:52,194
One day he said, "You chum around
a bit with this Simpson guy.

1319
01:26:52,196 --> 01:26:54,963
Could you bring him by, you
know, and introduce him to me?"

1320
01:26:54,965 --> 01:26:57,533
He was married to Marguerite at that time.

1321
01:26:57,535 --> 01:27:01,937
But as we're sitting there, this
gorgeous little surfer blonde

1322
01:27:01,939 --> 01:27:04,106
is waiting tables at lunch hour.

1323
01:27:04,108 --> 01:27:07,209
O.J. goes, "Wow, who's that?"

1324
01:27:07,211 --> 01:27:10,746
Jack had Nicole come over and said hello.

1325
01:27:10,748 --> 01:27:14,883
And she didn't walk 10 feet away,
and he looks right at Hanson and said,

1326
01:27:14,885 --> 01:27:16,785
"I'm gonna marry that girl."

1327
01:27:22,259 --> 01:27:26,595
She was 18 years old, she had
just graduated from high school.

1328
01:27:26,597 --> 01:27:29,164
She was just like my little sister.

1329
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:34,002
She goes, "I met this man,
and his name is O.J. Simpson."

1330
01:27:34,004 --> 01:27:37,739
They went out, and I waited up for them.

1331
01:27:39,343 --> 01:27:43,345
She got home, it was, like,
2 o'clock in the morning

1332
01:27:43,347 --> 01:27:48,650
and her jeans were ripped. And
I went, "What... ? What happened?"

1333
01:27:48,652 --> 01:27:52,120
And she goes, "Well, he
was a little forceful."

1334
01:27:52,122 --> 01:27:55,290
And I go, "Nicole, why would you let him,

1335
01:27:55,292 --> 01:27:58,026
first date, be a little bit forceful?"

1336
01:27:58,028 --> 01:28:01,797
"Well, Dave, don't be upset. I
think I really like this guy."

1337
01:28:01,799 --> 01:28:03,665
That was, you know, the start of it.

1338
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:09,137
About two days later, she
went back to work. She said,

1339
01:28:09,139 --> 01:28:14,810
"O.J. came in. He wants to get an
apartment for me and also a car."

1340
01:28:14,812 --> 01:28:16,645
And I went,

1341
01:28:16,647 --> 01:28:21,783
"Nicole, think about this. You
know, he's married and has children."

1342
01:28:21,785 --> 01:28:27,222
And she goes, "But I think I really
like this guy." It was that fast.

1343
01:28:28,792 --> 01:28:32,694
Eighteen years old. I
mean, it was too young.

1344
01:28:35,165 --> 01:28:38,867
She was quiet, nice, didn't say too much.

1345
01:28:38,869 --> 01:28:42,037
She wasn't like she was distant or
anything. She was just a shy person.

1346
01:28:42,039 --> 01:28:48,043
And Nicole was a doer. Whatever
Nicole put her mind to, she could do.

1347
01:28:48,045 --> 01:28:49,645
She actually wanted to be a photographer,

1348
01:28:49,647 --> 01:28:51,980
and she was always an artist.

1349
01:28:53,183 --> 01:28:55,217
Honestly, the connection's pretty obvious.

1350
01:28:55,219 --> 01:28:58,420
I mean, she's drop-dead gorgeous.

1351
01:29:00,224 --> 01:29:04,126
She was hot. My sister was
really a beautiful girl.

1352
01:29:05,829 --> 01:29:09,398
We didn't know who he was. We
were girls in the Brown house.

1353
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,601
We didn't grow up with
football. We went to the beach.

1354
01:29:12,603 --> 01:29:19,074
So when Nicole came home with
him, we were like, "Who are you?"

1355
01:29:19,076 --> 01:29:22,744
They had a real love affair, these two.

1356
01:29:22,746 --> 01:29:26,915
When they were together,
it was just... it was love.

1357
01:29:28,218 --> 01:29:31,019
And that's what makes this thing so sad.

1358
