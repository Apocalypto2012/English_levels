A few guys from over on
9th street grabbed Fanucci.

25
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,750
They cut his throat
from ear to ear.

00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,500

twelve hours a day, in the subway.

01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:26,875
I believe in America.

123
01:14:27,709 --> 01:14:30,417
America has made my fortune.

124
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,417
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

125
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:40,542
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonour her family.

126
01:14:41,417 --> 01:14:44,500
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

127
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,709
She went to the movies with him.

128
01:14:46,709 --> 01:14:49,166
She stayed out late.

129
01:14:49,166 --> 01:14:51,250
I didn't protest.

130
01:14:51,917 --> 01:14:56,792
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

131
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,000
They made her drink whiskey

132
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:04,375
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

133
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:09,542
She resisted, she kept her honour.

134
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:14,291
So they beat her like an animal.

135
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,291
When I went to the hospital,

136
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:19,959
her nose was broken,

137
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:22,250
her jaw was shattered,

138
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:25,458
held together by wire.

139
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:31,208
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

140
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:36,500
But I wept. Why did I weep?

141
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:41,750
She was the light of my life.

142
01:15:42,917 --> 01:15:45,208
Beautiful girl.

143
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:51,625
Now she will never be beautiful again.

144
01:15:57,792 --> 01:15:59,625
Sorry.

145
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:11,709
I went to the police,
like a good American.

146
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:15,542
These two boys were brought to trial.

147
01:16:15,834 --> 01:16:21,500
The judge sentenced them to three years
in prison, but suspended the sentence.

148
01:16:21,917 --> 01:16:28,250
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

149
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:32,542
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

150
01:16:32,542 --> 01:16:36,959
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

151
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:44,041
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

152
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:52,583
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

153
01:16:52,792 --> 01:16:58,333
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

154
01:16:58,917 --> 01:17:01,417
What is that?

155
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:13,458
I want them dead.

156
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:28,208
That I cannot do.

157
01:17:28,417 --> 01:17:31,834
I'll give you anything you ask.

158
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:38,750
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

159
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:45,166
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

160
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:49,834
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

161
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:54,959
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

162
01:17:55,166 --> 01:17:58,834
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

163
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:02,250
I didn't want to get into trouble.

164
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:04,583
I understand.

165
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:08,166
You found Paradise in America.

166
01:18:10,542 --> 01:18:15,291
Had a good trade, you made a good living, police
protected you, and there were courts of law.

167
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,458
You didn't need a friend like me.

168
01:18:19,792 --> 01:18:23,375
But now you come to me and say,

169
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:26,667
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

170
01:18:27,834 --> 01:18:30,625
But you don't ask with respect.

171
01:18:30,834 --> 01:18:36,000
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

172
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:43,959
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

173
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:46,667
I ask you for justice.

174
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:49,667
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

175
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:54,750
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

176
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:59,166
How much shall I pay you?

177
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:17,208
Bonasera, Bonasera.

178
01:19:17,417 --> 01:19:22,375
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

179
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:25,083
If you'd come in friendship,

180
01:19:25,291 --> 01:19:30,458
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

181
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:36,667
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

182
01:19:38,834 --> 01:19:41,792
And then they would fear you.

183
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:47,709
Be my friend?

184
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:54,125
Godfather?

185
01:19:57,166 --> 01:19:58,917
Good.

186
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:05,917
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

187
01:20:06,959 --> 01:20:09,834
But until that day...

188
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:15,125
...accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

189
01:20:15,333 --> 01:20:18,125
- Grazie, Godfather.
- Prego.

190
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:28,000
Give this to Clemenza.

191
01:20:29,792 --> 01:20:33,291
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

192
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:37,542
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

193
01:20:41,417 --> 01:20:43,083
- (Whistles)
-What?

194
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:44,250
Did you pay attention?

195
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:46,000
of course dad, what do you...

196
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:16,041
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

197
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:20,250
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

198
01:21:26,709 --> 01:21:29,583
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

199
01:22:18,834 --> 01:22:20,875
Don Barzini.

200
01:22:37,083 --> 01:22:40,250
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

201
01:22:40,458 --> 01:22:41,959
Paulie! More wine.

202
01:22:41,959 --> 01:22:42,959
<i>Scusi, please.</i>

203
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:47,875
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

204
01:22:49,792 --> 01:22:52,000
Take a walk and do your job.

205
01:22:59,709 --> 01:23:02,875
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

206
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:05,959
You watch yourself, all right?

207
01:23:10,667 --> 01:23:11,709
Hey, Tessio!
(Speaking Italian)

208
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:31,000
20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

209
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,083
In that little silk purse.

210
01:23:34,291 --> 01:23:37,875
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!

211
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:43,250
<i>Hey, Paulie!
I got two gobbagool...
gabagol and a prosciutto.</i>

212
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,583
Stupid jerk!

213
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:55,500
What's the matter?

214
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:10,083
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

215
01:24:10,291 --> 01:24:15,041
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

216
01:24:20,208 --> 01:24:25,750
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me.

217
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:33,834
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

218
01:24:34,417 --> 01:24:37,500
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

219
01:24:43,917 --> 01:24:47,333
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

220
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:52,625
Come here, come here, come here!

221
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:11,959
...but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

222
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:15,041
so for six months he's worked
in my pastry shop.

223
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,417
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

224
01:25:17,625 --> 01:25:19,792
Now that the war is over,

225
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,166
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

226
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:29,583
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

227
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:35,917
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

228
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:38,291
You understand everything.

229
01:25:39,166 --> 01:25:41,792
Mr Hagen. Thank you.

230
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:48,709
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

231
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:51,750
The bride, the groom and the angel...

232
01:25:56,583 --> 01:26:01,041
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisàn.

233
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:06,625
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

234
01:26:13,417 --> 01:26:15,625
Hey, Michael!

235
01:26:34,542 --> 01:26:38,875
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

236
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:46,542
Is this necessary?

237
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:51,792
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

238
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:58,041
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me

239
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:03,667
on the wedding day of your daughter.
May their first child be a masculine child.

240
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:07,583
Michael...

241
01:27:07,792 --> 01:27:11,166
That man over there
is talking to himself.

242
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:14,208
See that scary guy over there?

243
01:27:14,417 --> 01:27:17,375
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

244
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:22,500
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

245
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:27,250
Michael, he's coming over here!

246
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:33,291
You look terrific!

247
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:36,834
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

248
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:40,709
Your father's been asking for you.

249
01:27:40,917 --> 01:27:43,917
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

250
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:48,208
Why does your brother
have a different name?

251
01:27:48,417 --> 01:27:51,959
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

252
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:56,417
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

253
01:27:57,834 --> 01:28:00,792
He's been with us ever since.

254
01:28:01,041 --> 01:28:03,583
He's a good lawyer.

255
01:28:03,792 --> 01:28:08,375
Not a Sicilian. I think he's
going to be consigliere.

256
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:11,375
- What's that?
- That's a...

257
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:16,041
...like a counsellor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

258
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:18,500
You like your lasagne?

259
01:28:22,792 --> 01:28:25,000
Don Corleone.

260
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:27,583
I'm honoured and grateful

261
01:28:27,792 --> 01:28:31,917
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

262
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:39,834
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

263
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:45,375
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

264
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:51,959
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

265
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:58,417
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

266
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:04,041
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

267
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:06,291
Thank you.

268
01:29:55,667 --> 01:29:57,792
Signora Corleone!

269
01:29:58,959 --> 01:30:00,792
No!

270
01:31:10,834 --> 01:31:15,709
Senator Cauley apologised for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

271
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:20,291
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

272
01:31:23,166 --> 01:31:24,667
What is that outside?

273
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:36,834
Johnny! Johnny!

274
01:31:39,083 --> 01:31:41,125
I love you!

275
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,542
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

276
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:59,083
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

277
01:31:59,291 --> 01:32:04,000
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

278
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:21,917
You never said you knew
Johnny Fontane!

279
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:26,125
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

280
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:30,208
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

281
01:32:30,417 --> 01:32:33,208
<i>How?
- I have but one heart</i>

282
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:36,542
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

283
01:32:36,542 --> 01:32:50,125
<i>- This heart I bring to you
- I have but one heart, to share with you</i>

284
01:32:50,834 --> 01:33:09,166
<i>- I have but one dream, that I can cling to
- you are the one dream, I pray comes true</i>

285
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:12,083
Please, Michael. Tell me.

286
01:33:15,792 --> 01:33:20,709
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

287
01:33:20,917 --> 01:33:23,500
with a big bandleader.

288
01:33:23,709 --> 01:33:28,875
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

289
01:33:29,083 --> 01:33:31,667
Johnny is my father's godson.

290
01:33:31,875 --> 01:33:35,125
My father went to see this bandleader.

291
01:33:35,333 --> 01:33:39,083
He offered him 10,000 dollars
to let Johnny go,

292
01:33:39,291 --> 01:33:41,792
but the bandleader said no.

293
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,542
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

294
01:33:49,291 --> 01:33:51,375
Within an hour,

295
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:57,458
he signed a release
for a certified cheque of 1,000 dollars.

296
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:02,875
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

297
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:09,166
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

298
01:34:09,417 --> 01:34:14,667
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

299
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:21,667
That's a true story.

300
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:36,083
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

301
01:34:47,959 --> 01:34:50,000
Beautiful!

302
01:34:58,458 --> 01:35:01,750
My godson comes all the way from California
And no one gets him a glass of wine.

303
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:03,208
Cent'anni! Salute!

304
01:35:21,959 --> 01:35:24,000
I'll take care of it.

305
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:25,834
Tom...

306
01:35:26,083 --> 01:35:30,208
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

307
01:35:36,959 --> 01:35:39,041
How are you, Fredo?

308
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:42,750
My brother Fredo,
this is Kay Adams.

309
01:35:43,792 --> 01:35:46,291
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

310
01:35:48,125 --> 01:35:51,375
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

311
01:35:51,583 --> 01:35:54,667
Yeah. This is your friend?

312
01:35:55,417 --> 01:36:00,709
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

313
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:07,875
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

314
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:13,458
But this... man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

315
01:36:13,667 --> 01:36:16,792
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

316
01:36:17,041 --> 01:36:21,500
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

317
01:36:25,166 --> 01:36:27,208
Sonny?

318
01:36:28,166 --> 01:36:29,500
Sonny?

319
01:36:35,875 --> 01:36:37,792
Sonny?

320
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,792
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

321
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,458
The old man wants you.

322
01:36:43,917 --> 01:36:45,834
One minute.

323
01:36:59,959 --> 01:37:05,000
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book, a best-seller.

324
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:08,583
The main character
is a guy just like me.

325
01:37:08,792 --> 01:37:11,625
I wouldn't even have to act.

326
01:37:11,834 --> 01:37:15,583
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

327
01:37:16,625 --> 01:37:20,875
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

328
01:37:21,083 --> 01:37:26,500
Is this how you turned out a Hollywood
finocchio, that cries like a woman?

329
01:37:26,709 --> 01:37:30,875
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

330
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:32,834
Ridiculous.

331
01:37:37,125 --> 01:37:40,458
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

332
01:37:40,667 --> 01:37:42,208
Good.

333
01:37:42,417 --> 01:37:47,583
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

334
01:37:52,458 --> 01:37:55,959
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

335
01:37:56,166 --> 01:38:01,375
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

336
01:38:01,583 --> 01:38:04,667
It's too late, they start shooting
in a week.

337
01:38:04,875 --> 01:38:08,166
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

338
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:16,333
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

339
01:38:18,083 --> 01:38:21,166
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

340
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:51,291
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

341
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:55,041
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

342
01:38:55,250 --> 01:39:00,542
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

343
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:03,291
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

344
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:08,125
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

345
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:12,291
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

346
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:18,166
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

347
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:23,875
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

348
01:39:25,667 --> 01:39:27,500
The hospital called

349
01:39:29,417 --> 01:39:33,083
<i>Consigliere Genco, He's not
gonna last out the night.</i>

350
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:42,208
Santino,
Go tell your brothers

351
01:39:42,417 --> 01:39:44,458
That I want them to
come with me to visit Genco.

352
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:46,083
And pay their respects.

353
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:49,375
Tell Fredo to drive The big car
and ask Johnny to come.

354
01:39:49,583 --> 01:39:53,417
- Pop, uh, Michael?
- All my sons.

355
01:39:57,458 --> 01:40:00,542
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

356
01:40:01,542 --> 01:40:03,417
Wait a minute.

357
01:40:03,625 --> 01:40:06,208
No, Michael. Not me.

358
01:40:08,834 --> 01:40:12,834
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

359
01:40:56,625 --> 01:41:00,667
Did your American girlfriend
get back in the city alright?

360
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:03,083
Tom said he'd
take her in.

361
01:41:36,667 --> 01:41:40,166
What are all these Christmas ribbons for?

362
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:44,750
For bravery.

363
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:48,583
What miracles
you do for strangers.

364
01:41:50,417 --> 01:41:53,458
Just a minute, Michael.
I want to talk to you.

365
01:41:53,667 --> 01:41:56,709
What are your plans
when you get out?

366
01:41:56,792 --> 01:41:58,375
Finish School.

367
01:41:59,417 --> 01:42:02,417
That's fine. I approve of that.

368
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:05,417
Michael, you never
come to me as a son should.

369
01:42:05,583 --> 01:42:07,500
You know that,
don't you?

370
01:42:07,709 --> 01:42:10,250
When you finish school
I want you to come
and talk to

371
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:13,083
because I have plans for you. You understand?

372
01:42:13,375 --> 01:42:14,583
We'll see.

373
01:42:34,583 --> 01:42:36,208
Genco.

374
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:39,625
Genco.

375
01:42:43,417 --> 01:42:46,792
I brought all my boys
to pay their respects.

376
01:42:47,166 --> 01:42:50,250
Even Johnny from Hollywood.

377
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:57,291
Godfather.
Godfather.

378
01:42:58,583 --> 01:43:02,709
It is your daughter's wedding day.

379
01:43:03,166 --> 01:43:06,250
you cannot refuse me.

380
01:43:06,709 --> 01:43:10,667
Cure me.
you have the power.

381
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:14,125
Genco, I have
no such power.

382
01:43:14,417 --> 01:43:16,750
But don't be afraid of death.

383
01:43:17,583 --> 01:43:20,583
It's been
arranged then?

384
01:43:20,750 --> 01:43:24,542
The last thing...
Resign yourself.

385
01:43:25,417 --> 01:43:30,667
<i>But you need
your old consigliere.</i>

386
01:43:30,792 --> 01:43:33,750
Who will replace me?

387
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:38,125
Stay. stay with me,
godfather.

388
01:43:38,333 --> 01:43:41,166
help me to meet death

389
01:43:41,583 --> 01:43:45,291
if he sees you,
he'll be frightened

390
01:43:45,583 --> 01:43:47,792
and leave me in peace.

391
01:43:48,125 --> 01:43:53,792
You can say a word. Pull a few strings, huh?

392
01:43:56,458 --> 01:43:59,083
- Stay with me, Godfather.
- I will.

393
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:01,750
- Don't betray me.
- No.

394
01:45:19,166 --> 01:45:22,291
Unaccustomed as I am
to public drinking...

395
01:45:22,625 --> 01:45:25,250
I mean speaking, of course.

396
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:29,083
Janie, seriously,
we took some time off
from the picture

397
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:31,583
because we all want to
wish you a happy birthday.

398
01:45:35,041 --> 01:45:38,250
now, Janie and everybody,
we have a big surprise for you.

399
01:45:38,458 --> 01:45:43,041
In order to show how much Woltz
International thinks of you

400
01:45:43,166 --> 01:45:46,417
we have brought you
a special birthday present.

401
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,750
Isn't he darling?

402
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:53,792
Wasn't that nice
of Mr. Woltz to give you
such a lovely present?

403
01:45:57,250 --> 01:46:01,083
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

404
01:46:01,291 --> 01:46:04,041
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

405
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:07,709
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr Woltz,

406
01:46:07,917 --> 01:46:10,542
if Mr Woltz would grant us a favour.

407
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:12,959
Woltz is listening.

408
01:46:13,208 --> 01:46:17,375
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

409
01:46:22,917 --> 01:46:27,875
And what favour would your friend
grant Mr Woltz?

410
01:46:28,083 --> 01:46:31,500
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

411
01:46:31,709 --> 01:46:35,625
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

412
01:46:35,834 --> 01:46:39,959
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

413
01:46:40,208 --> 01:46:44,834
Let me lay it on the line. Johnny
Fontane will never get that movie!

414
01:46:45,041 --> 01:46:49,417
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

415
01:46:49,625 --> 01:46:53,375
- I'm German-lrish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

416
01:46:53,583 --> 01:46:57,959
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

417
01:46:58,208 --> 01:47:01,291
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

418
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:07,041
I have a special practice. I handle
one client. I'll wait for your call.

419
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:12,083
By the way, I admire your pictures
very much.

420
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,667
Check him out.

421
01:47:40,375 --> 01:47:43,041
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

422
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:47,709
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

423
01:47:47,917 --> 01:47:50,583
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

424
01:47:50,792 --> 01:47:54,875
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

425
01:47:55,083 --> 01:47:57,959
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

426
01:47:58,208 --> 01:48:01,375
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

427
01:48:01,583 --> 01:48:04,375
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

428
01:48:07,166 --> 01:48:10,250
There you are.
600,000 dollars on four hoofs.

429
01:48:10,458 --> 01:48:14,166
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

430
01:48:14,375 --> 01:48:16,458
Khartoum.

431
01:48:16,667 --> 01:48:18,417
Khartoum.

432
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:24,166
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

433
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:26,875
Thanks, Tony.

434
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:30,250
Let's get something to eat.

435
01:48:30,458 --> 01:48:33,917
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

436
01:48:34,125 --> 01:48:38,417
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

437
01:48:38,625 --> 01:48:44,250
I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything
else. This favour I can't give him.

438
01:48:44,458 --> 01:48:48,291
He never asks a second favour
when he's been refused the first.

439
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:53,667
You don't understand. Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

440
01:48:54,667 --> 01:48:58,500
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

441
01:48:58,709 --> 01:49:03,208
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

442
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:09,333
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

443
01:49:09,542 --> 01:49:14,709
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

444
01:49:14,917 --> 01:49:19,500
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

445
01:49:19,709 --> 01:49:22,250
Let me be even more frank.

446
01:49:22,458 --> 01:49:27,333
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

447
01:49:27,542 --> 01:49:31,083
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

448
01:49:31,291 --> 01:49:36,458
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

449
01:49:36,667 --> 01:49:42,834
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

450
01:49:43,041 --> 01:49:45,625
And she runs off.

451
01:49:45,834 --> 01:49:49,250
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

452
01:49:49,959 --> 01:49:55,333
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

453
01:49:55,542 --> 01:49:57,792
You get the hell out of here!

454
01:49:57,959 --> 01:50:02,417
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

455
01:50:03,375 --> 01:50:06,667
Yeah, I heard that story.

456
01:50:07,375 --> 01:50:11,166
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

457
01:50:11,375 --> 01:50:13,959
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

458
01:50:14,166 --> 01:50:18,208
Mr Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

459
01:50:34,208 --> 01:50:37,500
What are you doing out here?
I told you never to go out
of the room.

460
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:40,625
Come on. I've got a few words
for you, little lady.

461
01:50:42,166 --> 01:50:44,250
(Overlapping shouts)

462
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:49,583
Hey, Connie,
What's the matter?

463
01:50:52,583 --> 01:50:56,208
They're arguing again.
Connie and Carlo are
constantly arguing.

464
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:57,750
I'm gonna talk to this brother-in-law.

465
01:50:58,083 --> 01:50:59,083
Sit down.

466
01:50:59,750 --> 01:51:02,625
Sit down. You never interfere
between a man and a woman.

467
01:51:02,709 --> 01:51:02,709
Sit down.

468
01:51:04,542 --> 01:51:08,208
Your business is here
with Tom and me.

469
01:51:11,083 --> 01:51:12,750
Is this woltz so tough?

470
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:14,583
We'll, he'd risk
a union slowdown.

471
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,458
He'd let that star actor
be exposed as a junkie.

472
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:21,083
Is he really tough?
Would he risk his honor for this..

473
01:51:21,333 --> 01:51:23,417
You mean is he a Sicilian?

474
01:51:23,583 --> 01:51:25,250
Forget about it.

475
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:29,166
Now, this little actress,
this child,

476
01:51:29,208 --> 01:51:32,417
- is that true?
- Yeah.

477
01:51:33,041 --> 01:51:34,583
<i> Infamnia </i>

478
01:51:36,583 --> 01:51:38,291
All right, send Luca Brasi to me.

479
01:51:38,333 --> 01:51:42,583
I think we're going to
find a way to reason
with this Mr. Jack Woltz.

480
01:53:32,542 --> 01:53:36,542
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

481
01:53:36,750 --> 01:53:39,667
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

482
01:53:39,875 --> 01:53:42,041
Now...

483
01:53:42,959 --> 01:53:48,333
Sollozzo is known as The Turk. He's
supposed to be very good with a knife,

484
01:53:48,959 --> 01:53:53,125
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

485
01:53:53,333 --> 01:53:56,417
His business is narcotics.

486
01:53:56,625 --> 01:53:59,750
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

487
01:53:59,959 --> 01:54:03,875
In Sicily he has plants to process them
into heroin.

488
01:54:04,083 --> 01:54:07,667
He needs cash, he needs protection
from the police.

489
01:54:07,875 --> 01:54:11,542
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.

490
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:17,959
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

491
01:54:18,166 --> 01:54:22,625
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

492
01:54:22,834 --> 01:54:25,417
He's known as a top narcotics man.

493
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:31,083
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

494
01:54:32,709 --> 01:54:34,125
Tom?

495
01:54:34,333 --> 01:54:38,250
Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.

496
01:54:38,458 --> 01:54:43,041
If we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.

497
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:47,667
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

498
01:54:47,875 --> 01:54:49,917
Then they come after us.

499
01:54:50,125 --> 01:54:56,166
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

500
01:54:56,375 --> 01:55:02,083
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in ten years' time.

501
01:55:06,125 --> 01:55:09,417
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

502
01:55:14,166 --> 01:55:16,542
Don Corleone.

503
01:55:17,959 --> 01:55:21,250
I need a man who has powerful friends.

504
01:55:21,458 --> 01:55:23,959
I need a million dollars in cash.

505
01:55:24,208 --> 01:55:30,166
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

506
01:55:31,375 --> 01:55:35,375
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30 per cent.

507
01:55:35,583 --> 01:55:39,709
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

508
01:55:39,917 --> 01:55:42,625
And then it would go up.

509
01:55:42,834 --> 01:55:46,417
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

510
01:55:48,166 --> 01:55:50,583
My compliments.

511
01:55:53,667 --> 01:55:56,458
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

512
01:55:56,667 --> 01:56:01,417
So I receive 30 per cent for finance,

513
01:56:01,625 --> 01:56:04,917
political influence and legal protection?

514
01:56:05,125 --> 01:56:07,792
That's right.

515
01:56:07,959 --> 01:56:11,792
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

516
01:56:11,959 --> 01:56:17,166
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

517
01:56:17,375 --> 01:56:20,166
ti saluto, Don Corleone.

518
01:56:29,834 --> 01:56:35,125
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

519
01:56:35,333 --> 01:56:37,625
to be treated with respect.

520
01:56:42,291 --> 01:56:45,834
But, I must say no to you.

521
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:49,375
And I'll give you my reason.

522
01:56:49,583 --> 01:56:53,625
It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics.

523
01:56:53,834 --> 01:56:58,458
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

524
01:56:58,667 --> 01:57:04,125
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

525
01:57:04,333 --> 01:57:08,917
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

526
01:57:09,125 --> 01:57:14,417
But your business is...
a little dangerous.

527
01:57:14,625 --> 01:57:18,667
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

528
01:57:18,875 --> 01:57:22,959
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

529
01:57:29,417 --> 01:57:34,291
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

530
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:38,208
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

531
01:57:38,417 --> 01:57:43,583
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

532
01:57:43,792 --> 01:57:46,792
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

533
01:57:46,959 --> 01:57:52,166
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

534
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:14,417
Santino.

535
01:58:14,625 --> 01:58:16,041
Come here.

536
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:25,250
What's the matter with you? Your brain
is going soft from playing with that girl.

537
01:58:25,458 --> 01:58:29,959
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

538
01:58:30,709 --> 01:58:32,792
Go on.

539
01:58:35,959 --> 01:58:38,917
Tom, what's this nonsense?

540
01:58:39,125 --> 01:58:42,959
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

541
01:58:44,583 --> 01:58:47,667
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

542
01:58:48,709 --> 01:58:50,333
And...

543
01:58:51,166 --> 01:58:53,917
...tell Luca Brasi to come in.

544
01:58:59,417 --> 01:59:02,834
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

545
01:59:03,041 --> 01:59:05,792
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

546
01:59:06,917 --> 01:59:09,583
Go to the Tattaglias.

547
01:59:10,583 --> 01:59:15,959
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

548
01:59:16,208 --> 01:59:19,333
and find out what you can.

549
01:59:36,041 --> 01:59:39,333
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

550
01:59:39,542 --> 01:59:44,208
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

551
01:59:44,417 --> 01:59:48,542
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

552
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:28,417
Hello?

553
02:00:28,417 --> 02:00:30,458
<i>Good afternoon,
it's 3:00.</i>

554
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:31,750
Thank you.

555
02:00:32,709 --> 02:00:35,458
- Michael, it's 3:00.
- What?

556
02:00:36,333 --> 02:00:39,583
It's 3:00.
Have to get up.

557
02:00:41,583 --> 02:00:45,333
Because we have to go
to your father's house.

558
02:00:45,583 --> 02:00:49,458
- Why do we have to?
- Because we have to.

559
02:00:51,083 --> 02:00:54,083
If we go to
my father's house

560
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:56,291
We can't push
the beds together.

561
02:00:56,583 --> 02:00:58,291
Why not?

562
02:00:58,667 --> 02:01:02,417
Because they're
in separate rooms.

563
02:01:05,625 --> 02:01:09,166
All right, then.
Then we won't go.

564
02:01:09,375 --> 02:01:10,667
We won't
tell your father.

565
02:01:11,083 --> 02:01:12,208
OK.

566
02:01:12,250 --> 02:01:15,709
We'll get married first
and tell him later.

567
02:01:18,250 --> 02:01:19,542
I can't do that.

568
02:01:19,583 --> 02:01:22,083
Then, Michael, Get out of bed.

569
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:25,250
Let's go tomorrow.

570
02:01:26,041 --> 02:01:28,709
Michael,
they're expecting us.

571
02:01:31,125 --> 02:01:34,041
OK. Get the phone.

572
02:01:34,083 --> 02:01:35,458
What are you
going to do?

573
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:37,709
Just the get the phone.

574
02:01:47,417 --> 02:01:49,083
<i>woman: Yes?
May I Help you?</i>

575
02:01:49,166 --> 02:01:51,041
May I please have, uh,

576
02:01:51,250 --> 02:01:56,166
Orchard 99539, please?

577
02:01:56,375 --> 02:01:59,417
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

578
02:01:59,583 --> 02:02:05,250
You're going to be the
long-distance operator
from New Hampshire.

579
02:02:07,709 --> 02:02:09,250
I can't do this.

580
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,375
Go ahead, you got it.

581
02:02:12,417 --> 02:02:13,375
Tom: Hello.

582
02:02:13,417 --> 02:02:15,750
Hello? This is
long distance calling.

583
02:02:15,750 --> 02:02:19,583
I have a collect phone call
from Mr. Michael Corleone.

584
02:02:19,583 --> 02:02:21,417
um, will you
accept the charges?

585
02:02:21,417 --> 02:02:24,291
- Yes.
- One moment, please.

586
02:02:24,375 --> 02:02:26,583
- Don't laugh.
- I'm not gonna...

587
02:02:28,375 --> 02:02:29,750
- Hello?
- Tom: Hello?

588
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:31,750
- Hello, Tom.
- Mike, how are you?

589
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:34,125
Listen, we're up
in New Hampshire still.

590
02:02:34,166 --> 02:02:36,000
We'll drive down
tomorrow morning.

591
02:02:36,041 --> 02:02:37,166
Is there anything
I could do for you?

592
02:02:37,208 --> 02:02:40,291
No, we're fine.
I'm gonna see you Christmas.

593
02:02:40,333 --> 02:02:41,417
Everyone's
going out to the mall?

594
02:02:41,458 --> 02:02:43,083
- Right.
- OK.

595
02:02:43,083 --> 02:02:44,583
Right, Mikey.
Bye-bye.

596
02:02:44,583 --> 02:02:46,333
It's fine...

597
02:02:49,375 --> 02:02:51,208
<i>Andiamo, Fredo.</i>

598
02:02:51,458 --> 02:02:54,875
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

599
02:02:55,083 --> 02:02:59,208
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

600
02:03:00,625 --> 02:03:04,250
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

601
02:03:07,375 --> 02:03:09,458
<i>Buon Natale, caro. Grazie.</i>

602
02:03:59,333 --> 02:04:03,709
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

603
02:04:04,542 --> 02:04:07,458
<i>Sue bequero Scotch? Prewar.</i>

604
02:04:07,709 --> 02:04:09,083
<i>Io no bib'.</i>

605
02:04:13,375 --> 02:04:14,709
You know who I am?

606
02:05:12,041 --> 02:05:13,417
<i>Grazie</i>

607
02:05:53,667 --> 02:05:56,875
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

608
02:05:57,667 --> 02:06:02,375
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

609
02:06:02,583 --> 02:06:06,458
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

610
02:06:07,458 --> 02:06:12,125
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

611
02:06:12,333 --> 02:06:13,959
Get in.

612
02:06:24,375 --> 02:06:27,291
<i>Ah, Aspetta, Fredo,
I'm going to buy some fruit.</i>

613
02:06:27,333 --> 02:06:29,375
OK, Pop.

614
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:38,083
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

615
02:07:57,583 --> 02:07:59,166
Pa Pa!

616
02:08:00,583 --> 02:08:01,625
Yeah.

617
02:08:01,625 --> 02:08:02,667
man: Do you recognize my voice?

618
02:08:02,667 --> 02:08:05,417
Yeah I think so. Detective Squad, right?

619
02:08:05,417 --> 02:08:07,709
Don't say my name,
just listen.

620
02:08:07,709 --> 02:08:12,166
Somebody shot your father outside
his place 15 minutes ago.

621
02:08:14,917 --> 02:08:16,417
Uh, is he dead?

622
02:08:16,417 --> 02:08:19,041
We can't get close enough to find out.

623
02:08:19,041 --> 02:08:21,250
There's blood
all over the place.

624
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:22,917
Look, I'll see what I can do.

625
02:08:22,917 --> 02:08:26,125
Find out what you can.
You got a grand coming. Alright?

626
02:08:48,834 --> 02:08:49,500
woman: Hello?

627
02:08:49,500 --> 02:08:51,083
- Theresa?
- Yes.

628
02:08:51,083 --> 02:08:53,917
- Let me talk to Tom.
- He's not home yet.

629
02:08:53,917 --> 02:08:56,041
Not yet, uh...

630
02:08:56,041 --> 02:08:58,792
Have him call me
the minute he gets in.

631
02:09:05,250 --> 02:09:09,750
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

632
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:13,834
No.

633
02:09:14,041 --> 02:09:18,542
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

634
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:22,291
Michael.

635
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:27,625
No, I wouldn't like you better if you were
Ingrid Bergman. What's the matter?

636
02:09:43,750 --> 02:09:46,417
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

637
02:10:08,667 --> 02:10:11,917
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?

638
02:10:12,083 --> 02:10:14,750
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

639
02:10:14,959 --> 02:10:19,625
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.

640
02:10:20,834 --> 02:10:24,000
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

641
02:10:24,208 --> 02:10:28,625
- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

642
02:10:28,834 --> 02:10:33,542
No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?

643
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:42,959
Oh, my God.

644
02:10:46,417 --> 02:10:48,083
Sonny!

645
02:10:56,625 --> 02:10:58,834
Stay back there.

646
02:10:59,041 --> 02:11:02,208
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

647
02:11:04,083 --> 02:11:07,208
There's more news about your old man.

648
02:11:07,417 --> 02:11:10,166
Word is out that he's already dead.

649
02:11:10,375 --> 02:11:14,000
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

650
02:11:14,208 --> 02:11:17,417
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

651
02:11:17,625 --> 02:11:20,166
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

652
02:11:20,375 --> 02:11:24,083
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

653
02:11:24,291 --> 02:11:28,709
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

654
02:11:28,917 --> 02:11:32,667
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

655
02:11:39,417 --> 02:11:43,667
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

656
02:11:47,834 --> 02:11:50,166
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

657
02:11:50,375 --> 02:11:53,208
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

658
02:11:53,417 --> 02:11:56,792
In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.

659
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,250
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.

660
02:12:00,458 --> 02:12:05,041
What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.

661
02:12:05,250 --> 02:12:07,417
I'll wait.

662
02:12:25,625 --> 02:12:28,583
Ma...Where are you?

663
02:12:45,333 --> 02:12:47,208
Ma, I, uh...

664
02:12:47,417 --> 02:12:51,542
I just got a phone call
And pop's been hurt.

665
02:12:51,667 --> 02:12:54,291
I don't know how bad.

666
02:13:02,250 --> 02:13:07,542
I'm going to go change
in case we can see him.

667
02:13:55,709 --> 02:13:57,333
<i>- Tessio.
- Tessio: Hello? </i>

668
02:13:57,417 --> 02:13:58,750
Santino Corleone.

669
02:13:59,208 --> 02:14:01,417
I want 50 good men
out here right away.

670
02:14:01,458 --> 02:14:02,542
<i>Tessio: I heard you, sonny, </i>

671
02:14:02,667 --> 02:14:04,750
<i>But what about Clemenza's Regime?</i>

672
02:14:04,834 --> 02:14:07,166
No, I don't want to use
Clemenza's people right now.

673
02:14:07,208 --> 02:14:09,083
<i> - All right.
- All right.</i>

674
02:14:50,208 --> 02:14:52,417
Come on, Luca.

675
02:15:03,500 --> 02:15:06,291
Your boss is dead.

676
02:15:08,375 --> 02:15:13,583
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

677
02:15:13,792 --> 02:15:19,041
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

678
02:15:21,709 --> 02:15:26,458
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

679
02:15:27,792 --> 02:15:29,250
Drink it.

680
02:15:33,625 --> 02:15:37,083
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

681
02:15:41,458 --> 02:15:45,417
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

682
02:15:45,625 --> 02:15:49,333
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

683
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:55,166
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

684
02:15:56,125 --> 02:16:02,041
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

685
02:16:02,667 --> 02:16:07,834
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

686
02:16:08,041 --> 02:16:13,625
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

687
02:16:16,083 --> 02:16:19,667
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

688
02:16:22,959 --> 02:16:27,709
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

689
02:16:28,667 --> 02:16:35,083
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

690
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:42,917
It's good business, Tom.

691
02:16:43,125 --> 02:16:48,333
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

692
02:16:50,959 --> 02:16:53,166
Yeah, well...

693
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:57,166
Let me worry about Luca.

694
02:17:02,083 --> 02:17:04,166
You just talk to Sonny.

695
02:17:04,375 --> 02:17:07,208
And the other two kids.

696
02:17:09,792 --> 02:17:13,000
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

697
02:17:14,667 --> 02:17:17,667
Now you can go.

698
02:17:24,041 --> 02:17:27,917
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

699
02:17:28,834 --> 02:17:31,917
Blood is a big expense.

700
02:17:52,291 --> 02:17:54,333
He's still alive.

701
02:17:54,500 --> 02:17:58,291
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

702
02:17:58,500 --> 02:18:03,667
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

703
02:18:18,125 --> 02:18:20,333
- Who are you?
- It's the don's kid.

704
02:18:20,375 --> 02:18:22,750
you take the car,
I'll bring him inside.

705
02:19:06,250 --> 02:19:08,291
Your mother's over
in the hospital
with your father.

706
02:19:08,333 --> 02:19:11,250
Looks like he's going to pull through, thank God.

707
02:19:13,667 --> 02:19:17,667
Theresa, you hear
from Tom yet?

708
02:19:23,208 --> 02:19:26,083
Is Sonny inside?

709
02:19:26,250 --> 02:19:27,750
Come on.

710
02:19:34,458 --> 02:19:37,375
- Tessio: Could be
any one of these.
- Yeah...

711
02:19:37,542 --> 02:19:39,709
Hey, Theresa.

712
02:19:41,166 --> 02:19:43,417
Don't worry.
They'll turn Tom loose

713
02:19:43,417 --> 02:19:44,750
the minute they
get the proposition.

714
02:19:44,750 --> 02:19:46,542
Hello, Michael.

715
02:19:51,208 --> 02:19:52,750
Where were you?

716
02:19:53,166 --> 02:19:57,166
- Mikey, you had me worried when
I couldn't get in touch with you.
- How's ma taking it?

717
02:19:57,208 --> 02:20:00,083
She's good.
She's been through it before.

718
02:20:00,083 --> 02:20:01,417
Me too...

719
02:20:05,125 --> 02:20:07,750
<i>- Yeah.
- Hello, Santino?</i>

720
02:20:07,750 --> 02:20:09,583
<i>This is Sam
from the company.</i>

721
02:20:09,625 --> 02:20:12,542
<i>The number you gave me?
It checked out.</i>

722
02:20:13,083 --> 02:20:16,333
Listen, Thank you very much.
You're going to have a very...

723
02:20:16,375 --> 02:20:19,208
...very extra
Merry Christmas, alright?

724
02:20:19,250 --> 02:20:20,375
<i>Sam: OK, THanks a lot.</i>

725
02:20:20,417 --> 02:20:22,041
6Thank you.

726
02:20:22,625 --> 02:20:27,000
You want to wait outside? I got some business
I got to finish with Tessio.

727
02:20:29,542 --> 02:20:32,083
What are you doing?

728
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:34,041
You hang around
you're going to hear things

729
02:20:34,083 --> 02:20:37,583
- you don't want to hear.
- Maybe I can help you out.

730
02:20:37,583 --> 02:20:40,166
No you can't. The old man
would have my neck

731
02:20:40,208 --> 02:20:42,250
If I let you get
mixed up in this.
Come on!

732
02:20:42,250 --> 02:20:44,667
He's my father too, Sonny.

733
02:20:45,083 --> 02:20:46,583
You wanna hear?

734
02:20:46,583 --> 02:20:49,333
Whose head do we blow off,
Clemenza's or Paulie's?

735
02:20:49,375 --> 02:20:50,125
What do you mean?

736
02:20:50,166 --> 02:20:53,291
What do I mean.
One of them set up the old man.

737
02:20:53,333 --> 02:20:54,166
Yeah.

738
02:20:54,208 --> 02:20:57,000
Not Clemenza.
I don't believe it.

739
02:20:57,041 --> 02:20:59,417
See?
College boy is right.

740
02:20:59,458 --> 02:21:02,417
It was Paulie. That was the
contact in the phone company.

741
02:21:02,458 --> 02:21:05,291
In the three days that
Paulie was home sick

742
02:21:05,333 --> 02:21:09,041
He got these phone calls
from the pay phone across
from the old man's building.

743
02:21:09,083 --> 02:21:11,291
- So it was paulie.
- Thank God it was paulie

744
02:21:11,333 --> 02:21:12,583
Tessio: That skinny punk.

745
02:21:12,583 --> 02:21:14,041
But we need
Clemenza badly.

746
02:21:14,083 --> 02:21:16,250
Is it going to be an all
out war like the last time?

747
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:19,417
Yeah. Until the old man
tells me different.

748
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:21,500
Wait, Sonny.
Talk to pop.

749
02:21:21,542 --> 02:21:24,750
Wait? Come on!
Sollozzo's a dead man.

750
02:21:25,041 --> 02:21:27,667
I don't care what it costs.
We'll go after all them families.

751
02:21:27,709 --> 02:21:29,750
The Tattaglias
are going to eat dirt.

752
02:21:29,834 --> 02:21:31,125
That's not how pop
would play it.

753
02:21:31,166 --> 02:21:35,125
Listen Let me tell you something.
When it comes to the action
I'm as good as anybody

754
02:21:35,166 --> 02:21:36,750
And don't forget it.

755
02:21:36,750 --> 02:21:38,417
Tom!

756
02:21:40,417 --> 02:21:43,250
Hey! Boy, if I argue
against the supreme court

757
02:21:43,250 --> 02:21:46,667
I'll never do better than I did against that Turk tonight.

758
02:21:48,250 --> 02:21:50,333
Give me a minute,
will ya?

759
02:21:51,417 --> 02:21:53,625
- So what do you think?
- Sollozzo, Phillip Tattaglia...
It's too personal

760
02:21:53,667 --> 02:21:54,500
That's a lot of bad blood.

761
02:21:54,542 --> 02:21:55,500
The don would consider...

762
02:21:55,750 --> 02:21:57,125
We're gonna kill
all those guys?

763
02:21:57,166 --> 02:21:58,792
Hey, stay out of it

764
02:21:58,834 --> 02:21:59,709
Sollozzo's the Key.

765
02:21:59,750 --> 02:22:02,083
Get rid of him, everything falls into line.

766
02:22:02,083 --> 02:22:05,333
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

767
02:22:06,041 --> 02:22:09,959
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

768
02:22:10,166 --> 02:22:13,917
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

769
02:22:14,166 --> 02:22:18,917
- Hey, do me a favour...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

770
02:22:19,917 --> 02:22:26,041
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

771
02:22:26,291 --> 02:22:32,542
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

772
02:22:32,750 --> 02:22:38,000
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

773
02:22:38,208 --> 02:22:42,709
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

774
02:22:42,917 --> 02:22:44,625
If your father dies...

775
02:22:46,834 --> 02:22:48,583
...you make the deal.

776
02:22:48,792 --> 02:22:53,500
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

777
02:22:58,041 --> 02:23:00,458
What is it?

778
02:23:00,667 --> 02:23:05,834
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

779
02:23:06,041 --> 02:23:09,333
Tessio, go see what it is.

780
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,250
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

781
02:23:14,458 --> 02:23:18,125
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

782
02:23:18,333 --> 02:23:21,792
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

783
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,667
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

784
02:23:26,250 --> 02:23:31,291
<i>Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man. That Stronz'</i>

785
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:35,834
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

786
02:23:36,041 --> 02:23:40,417
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

787
02:23:40,625 --> 02:23:44,583
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

788
02:23:46,542 --> 02:23:50,417
Hanging around the house on
the phone would be a big help.

789
02:23:51,041 --> 02:23:53,375
Try Luca again.

790
02:24:02,041 --> 02:24:04,834
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

791
02:24:05,041 --> 02:24:08,834
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

792
02:24:29,250 --> 02:24:31,000
Beautiful Car.

793
02:24:31,291 --> 02:24:33,375
It ain't a beautiful car.

794
02:24:33,583 --> 02:24:37,166
Stupid Detroit sends it
with wooden bumpers.

795
02:24:37,667 --> 02:24:39,333
They're going to deliver the chromium bumpers

796
02:24:39,375 --> 02:24:44,417
in a couple of months
because of the war.

797
02:24:44,417 --> 02:24:46,417
Hey, the war is over.

798
02:24:46,417 --> 02:24:47,583
I had to wait
for over two years

799
02:24:47,583 --> 02:24:50,625
for the car to come
with stupid wooden bumpers.

800
02:24:53,083 --> 02:24:55,041
.22 Soft nose load.

801
02:24:55,083 --> 02:24:57,250
Accurate up to five-foot.

802
02:24:57,291 --> 02:24:58,750
Today you make your bones
on Paulie.

803
02:24:58,792 --> 02:25:01,709
- You understand everything?
- Understood, Mr. Clemenza.

804
02:25:06,041 --> 02:25:08,291
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

805
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:10,792
Probably late.

806
02:25:12,250 --> 02:25:16,000
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

807
02:25:18,166 --> 02:25:22,792
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

808
02:25:24,083 --> 02:25:27,834
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

809
02:25:28,041 --> 02:25:33,500
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

810
02:25:33,709 --> 02:25:37,208
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

811
02:25:37,375 --> 02:25:41,000
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

812
02:25:41,208 --> 02:25:43,125
Watch the kids.

813
02:25:55,291 --> 02:25:56,542
man: He's coming.

814
02:25:56,542 --> 02:25:58,709
It's about time.

815
02:26:04,542 --> 02:26:06,542
It's good for ten men.

816
02:26:06,542 --> 02:26:08,125
All right, go over to the neighborhood.

817
02:26:08,125 --> 02:26:10,625
I got to call in to Sonny.

818
02:26:19,542 --> 02:26:21,792
You wait here,
I'll call Sonny.

819
02:26:38,250 --> 02:26:39,750
Don Clemenza

820
02:27:06,083 --> 02:27:08,500
(Speaking Italian)

821
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:25,041
He talked my ear off.

822
02:27:25,041 --> 02:27:26,500
We got to go back
to Long Beach.

823
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:28,291
He got another job for us.

824
02:27:28,333 --> 02:27:31,041
What do you think?
We going to get that last place we saw?

825
02:27:31,041 --> 02:27:33,041
I don't know.
Why do you got to know now?

826
02:27:33,041 --> 02:27:34,291
I don't got
to know nothing.

827
02:27:34,333 --> 02:27:38,041
Drive the car, and watch
where you're going.

828
02:27:42,250 --> 02:27:44,083
Clemenza:
Paulie, Go down 39th street.

829
02:27:44,083 --> 02:27:46,750
Pick up 18 mattresses
for the guys.

830
02:27:46,750 --> 02:27:47,750
Bring me the bill.

831
02:27:47,750 --> 02:27:49,500
Paulie: Yeah, all right...now

832
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:51,125
Clemenz:
Make sure they're clean

833
02:27:51,125 --> 02:27:54,208
Because those guys will be
stuck up there for a long time.

834
02:27:54,208 --> 02:27:56,375
Paulie:
They're clean. They exterminate them.

835
02:27:56,375 --> 02:27:59,125
Clemenza: Exterminate? That's a bad word to use.

836
02:27:59,125 --> 02:28:01,667
Get this guy.
Watch out we don't
exterminate you.

837
02:28:01,667 --> 02:28:02,458
Paulie:
Think that's funny or what?

838
02:28:02,458 --> 02:28:05,291
Clemenza:
Hey, Paulie..
(Speaks Italian)...

839
02:28:05,291 --> 02:28:06,291
Paulie: Rocco,
What did you do?

840
02:28:06,333 --> 02:28:08,083
Rocco: Not me. Wasn't Me.

841
02:28:08,083 --> 02:28:09,166
Paulie: It's gotta be him

842
02:28:09,166 --> 02:28:11,542
Clemenza: Hey, Pull over, will you?
I gotta take a leak.

843
02:28:53,458 --> 02:28:55,291
Leave the gun

844
02:28:55,291 --> 02:28:57,583
Take the cannoli.

845
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,500
Clemenza: Hey, Mike!

846
02:29:16,750 --> 02:29:20,417
Hey Mikey!
- Yeah.

847
02:29:20,417 --> 02:29:23,166
You're wanted
on the telephone.

848
02:29:27,750 --> 02:29:30,667
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

849
02:29:34,375 --> 02:29:36,667
- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?

850
02:29:36,875 --> 02:29:38,625
He's going to make it.

851
02:29:39,291 --> 02:29:41,333
I love you.

852
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,041
I love you!

853
02:29:44,917 --> 02:29:47,375
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

854
02:29:47,625 --> 02:29:50,375
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.

855
02:29:50,625 --> 02:29:52,875
Can't you say it?

856
02:29:53,667 --> 02:29:55,500
I'll see you tonight.

857
02:29:56,333 --> 02:29:59,375
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

858
02:29:59,625 --> 02:30:05,250
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

859
02:30:05,458 --> 02:30:10,166
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

860
02:30:10,375 --> 02:30:14,000
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

861
02:30:14,208 --> 02:30:19,542
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

862
02:30:19,750 --> 02:30:24,875
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

863
02:30:25,750 --> 02:30:28,375
Add a little bit of wine.

864
02:30:31,041 --> 02:30:35,542
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

865
02:30:35,750 --> 02:30:40,000
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

866
02:30:40,208 --> 02:30:43,250
You won't see him anymore.

867
02:30:43,458 --> 02:30:46,208
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

868
02:30:46,375 --> 02:30:49,792
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

869
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:53,166
He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows
he's a civilian.

870
02:30:53,375 --> 02:30:56,083
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

871
02:30:58,458 --> 02:31:00,667
Send somebody with him anyway.

872
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:32,166
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

873
02:31:33,542 --> 02:31:38,000
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

874
02:31:38,208 --> 02:31:40,709
I'll wait in the cab.

875
02:31:42,709 --> 02:31:45,792
I don't want you to get involved.

876
02:31:48,083 --> 02:31:51,375
When will I see you again?

877
02:31:56,625 --> 02:32:00,917
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll
call you at your parents' house.

878
02:32:02,458 --> 02:32:07,542
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

879
02:34:19,208 --> 02:34:23,250
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

880
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:26,583
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

881
02:34:26,792 --> 02:34:29,583
What happened to the guards?

882
02:34:29,792 --> 02:34:34,959
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

883
02:34:35,166 --> 02:34:38,750
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

884
02:34:42,625 --> 02:34:46,792
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

885
02:34:49,250 --> 02:34:52,333
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

886
02:34:55,625 --> 02:35:00,375
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

887
02:35:00,625 --> 02:35:04,667
No Tessio's men, no detectives,
nobody. Papa's all alone.

888
02:35:04,875 --> 02:35:07,625
- Don't panic, I'll send someone.
- I won't panic.

889
02:35:08,875 --> 02:35:12,000
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

890
02:35:14,542 --> 02:35:20,250
We're going to move him to another
room. Can you disconnect the tubes?

891
02:35:20,458 --> 02:35:23,959
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

892
02:35:24,166 --> 02:35:28,291
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

893
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:30,625
Help me, please.

894
02:36:47,333 --> 02:36:51,333
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

895
02:36:52,166 --> 02:36:54,291
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

896
02:36:54,500 --> 02:36:57,375
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

897
02:36:57,583 --> 02:37:02,375
If there is trouble, I'll stay here to
help you. For your father.

898
02:37:03,458 --> 02:37:08,291
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

899
02:37:08,500 --> 02:37:10,625
I'll be out in a minute.

900
02:37:24,458 --> 02:37:28,834
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

901
02:37:29,959 --> 02:37:32,208
I'm with you now.

902
02:37:33,583 --> 02:37:35,291
I'm with you.

903
02:38:10,625 --> 02:38:12,959
Get rid of these. Come here.

904
02:38:13,750 --> 02:38:18,917
Put your hand in your pocket, like you
have a gun. You'll be all right.

905
02:39:09,500 --> 02:39:11,750
You did good.

906
02:39:59,709 --> 02:40:03,041
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

907
02:40:03,250 --> 02:40:07,458
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

908
02:40:07,667 --> 02:40:11,709
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

909
02:40:11,917 --> 02:40:17,875
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

910
02:40:18,500 --> 02:40:21,583
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

911
02:40:21,792 --> 02:40:26,375
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

912
02:40:27,542 --> 02:40:33,875
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

913
02:40:34,083 --> 02:40:36,041
Stand him up straight.

914
02:40:58,125 --> 02:41:03,083
I'm the Corleone's attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

915
02:41:03,291 --> 02:41:05,667
They're licensed to carry firearms.

916
02:41:05,875 --> 02:41:10,917
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

917
02:41:11,125 --> 02:41:13,291
Let him go.

918
02:41:45,375 --> 02:41:49,166
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

919
02:41:49,375 --> 02:41:52,041
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

920
02:41:52,250 --> 02:41:55,291
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

921
02:41:56,458 --> 02:41:58,667
Jesus Christ.

922
02:42:05,208 --> 02:42:08,291
Looks like a fortress around here.

923
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:15,125
Tommasuccio! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

924
02:42:15,333 --> 02:42:19,333
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

925
02:42:21,083 --> 02:42:23,208
Mike, let me look at you.

926
02:42:27,083 --> 02:42:30,250
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

927
02:42:30,458 --> 02:42:35,875
The Turk wants to talk! Imagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

928
02:42:36,083 --> 02:42:38,959
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

929
02:42:39,166 --> 02:42:43,500
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

930
02:42:43,709 --> 02:42:46,834
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

931
02:42:47,125 --> 02:42:50,333
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

932
02:42:50,542 --> 02:42:54,834
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

933
02:42:55,041 --> 02:42:58,125
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

934
02:42:58,333 --> 02:43:01,542
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

935
02:43:01,750 --> 02:43:04,834
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

936
02:43:05,041 --> 02:43:07,709
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

937
02:43:07,917 --> 02:43:10,583
Your father wouldn't want to hear this.
This is business, not personal!

938
02:43:10,792 --> 02:43:15,458
- They shot my father...
- Even the shooting was business, not personal, Sonny.

939
02:43:15,667 --> 02:43:19,291
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favour.

940
02:43:19,500 --> 02:43:24,125
No more advice on how to
patch things up. Just help me win.

941
02:43:29,792 --> 02:43:33,542
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

942
02:43:33,750 --> 02:43:38,000
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

943
02:43:38,208 --> 02:43:42,041
McCluskey has agreed to be
The Turk's bodyguard.

944
02:43:42,250 --> 02:43:45,875
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

945
02:43:46,083 --> 02:43:49,667
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

946
02:43:49,875 --> 02:43:55,625
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

947
02:43:55,834 --> 02:43:59,667
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

948
02:44:00,959 --> 02:44:05,291
Do me a favour.
Take this into consideration.

949
02:44:08,750 --> 02:44:11,000
All right, we'll wait.

950
02:44:15,750 --> 02:44:19,166
We can't wait. We can't wait.

951
02:44:20,166 --> 02:44:24,083
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

952
02:44:24,291 --> 02:44:28,083
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

953
02:44:28,291 --> 02:44:32,375
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

954
02:44:32,625 --> 02:44:37,375
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

955
02:44:42,291 --> 02:44:45,709
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

956
02:44:45,917 --> 02:44:50,834
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

957
02:44:52,458 --> 02:44:55,083
Let's set the meeting.

958
02:44:56,583 --> 02:45:00,709
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

959
02:45:02,166 --> 02:45:06,000
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

960
02:45:06,208 --> 02:45:10,208
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

961
02:45:12,458 --> 02:45:15,375
They'll search me when I meet them,
right?

962
02:45:15,625 --> 02:45:18,500
So I can't have a weapon on me.

963
02:45:21,375 --> 02:45:26,792
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me...

964
02:45:31,333 --> 02:45:34,083
...then I'll kill them both.

965
02:45:45,750 --> 02:45:50,458
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

966
02:45:50,667 --> 02:45:54,208
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

967
02:45:54,375 --> 02:46:00,834
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

968
02:46:01,041 --> 02:46:03,834
You're taking this very personal.

969
02:46:04,041 --> 02:46:07,375
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

970
02:46:07,583 --> 02:46:11,333
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

971
02:46:11,542 --> 02:46:18,000
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

972
02:46:18,208 --> 02:46:22,208
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

973
02:46:22,375 --> 02:46:27,792
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

974
02:46:28,625 --> 02:46:32,667
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

975
02:46:36,041 --> 02:46:39,917
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

976
02:46:42,750 --> 02:46:47,959
It's as cold as they come. Impossible to
trace, so you don't worry about prints.

977
02:46:48,166 --> 02:46:52,792
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

978
02:47:04,375 --> 02:47:07,125
Is the trigger too tight?

979
02:47:09,917 --> 02:47:11,250
My ears!

980
02:47:11,458 --> 02:47:16,875
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

981
02:47:17,083 --> 02:47:20,208
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

982
02:47:21,834 --> 02:47:25,834
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

983
02:47:26,041 --> 02:47:29,500
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

984
02:47:29,709 --> 02:47:33,917
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

985
02:47:34,125 --> 02:47:36,959
so walk out fast, but don't run.

986
02:47:37,166 --> 02:47:40,583
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

987
02:47:40,792 --> 02:47:44,083
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

988
02:47:46,166 --> 02:47:50,375
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

989
02:47:50,583 --> 02:47:53,041
and we'll catch the hell.

990
02:47:53,250 --> 02:47:56,959
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

991
02:47:57,166 --> 02:48:00,792
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

992
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:06,000
These things have to happen every five,
ten years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

993
02:48:06,208 --> 02:48:10,375
Been ten years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

994
02:48:10,625 --> 02:48:16,750
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

995
02:48:17,542 --> 02:48:21,959
You know, Mike, we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

996
02:48:22,166 --> 02:48:24,667
Your father too.

997
02:49:01,875 --> 02:49:05,375
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

998
02:49:06,375 --> 02:49:10,625
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

999
02:49:10,834 --> 02:49:13,709
How much time do we have?

1000
02:49:13,917 --> 02:49:19,083
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

1001
02:49:19,625 --> 02:49:25,375
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

1002
02:49:25,917 --> 02:49:30,542
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

1003
02:49:30,750 --> 02:49:35,834
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

1004
02:49:36,041 --> 02:49:39,500
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

1005
02:49:39,709 --> 02:49:43,333
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

1006
02:49:43,542 --> 02:49:46,792
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

1007
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,125
I'll get it.

1008
02:50:13,583 --> 02:50:15,667
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

1009
02:50:15,875 --> 02:50:19,000
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

1010
02:50:19,208 --> 02:50:24,959
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

1011
02:50:25,166 --> 02:50:30,000
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

1012
02:50:30,208 --> 02:50:35,208
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

1013
02:50:35,375 --> 02:50:41,458
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

1014
02:50:42,875 --> 02:50:45,583
We might be able to tape the gun
behind it.

1015
02:50:45,792 --> 02:50:50,375
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

1016
02:50:50,542 --> 02:50:54,375
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

1017
02:50:54,625 --> 02:50:59,625
Then you go to take a leak. No, better
still, you ask permission to go.

1018
02:50:59,834 --> 02:51:04,542
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

1019
02:51:04,750 --> 02:51:08,542
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

1020
02:51:08,750 --> 02:51:11,750
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

1021
02:51:11,959 --> 02:51:17,625
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

1022
02:51:17,834 --> 02:51:20,333
Let's move.

1023
02:51:24,959 --> 02:51:28,041
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

1024
02:51:28,250 --> 02:51:30,500
Yeah, a million times.

1025
02:51:34,667 --> 02:51:39,834
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in
the head as soon as you come out.

1026
02:51:45,542 --> 02:51:49,667
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

1027
02:51:49,875 --> 02:51:52,208
At least a year.

1028
02:51:52,375 --> 02:51:57,583
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

1029
02:51:58,500 --> 02:52:02,250
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

1030
02:52:08,250 --> 02:52:10,500
Take care.

1031
02:52:12,709 --> 02:52:15,000
Take care, Mike.

1032
02:52:46,959 --> 02:52:51,125
I'm glad you came. I hope we can
straighten everything out.

1033
02:52:52,208 --> 02:52:57,000
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

1034
02:52:57,208 --> 02:53:01,667
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.

1035
02:53:01,875 --> 02:53:05,834
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

1036
02:53:06,041 --> 02:53:09,291
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

1037
02:53:09,500 --> 02:53:15,041
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

1038
02:53:15,250 --> 02:53:17,667
He's a good kid.

1039
02:53:21,291 --> 02:53:24,792
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

1040
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:30,166
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

1041
02:53:34,041 --> 02:53:39,166
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

1042
02:53:40,083 --> 02:53:44,125
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

1043
02:53:46,250 --> 02:53:49,125
He's clean.

1044
02:54:14,375 --> 02:54:16,792
Going to Jersey?

1045
02:54:19,083 --> 02:54:21,583
Maybe.

1046
02:54:45,917 --> 02:54:48,542
Nice work, Lou.

1047
02:55:24,917 --> 02:55:30,333
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

1048
02:55:30,542 --> 02:55:33,083
I'll have it.

1049
02:56:08,083 --> 02:56:10,417
I’m going to speak Italian to Michael

1050
02:56:10,417 --> 02:56:11,542
Go ahead

1051
02:56:17,625 --> 02:56:20,208
(Italian) I'm sorry. - Michael: Are you serious?

1052
02:56:23,250 --> 02:56:27,792
You must understand. That what happened
between me and your father...

1053
02:56:27,792 --> 02:56:30,667
...was a matter of business.

1054
02:56:30,667 --> 02:56:34,083
I have a great respect for your father.

1055
02:56:34,083 --> 02:56:38,750
But your father’s thinking is old-fashioned.

1056
02:56:38,750 --> 02:56:43,709
And he doesn't understand that I
am a man of honor.

1057
02:56:43,709 --> 02:56:48,750
Don’t tell me these things. I know them.

1058
02:56:48,750 --> 02:56:51,125
You know?

1059
02:57:02,166 --> 02:57:09,417
And you understand that I helped the Tattaglia family.

1060
02:57:09,417 --> 02:57:13,458
I believe that we can come to an agreement.

1061
02:57:14,625 --> 02:57:17,208
I want peace.

1062
02:57:17,208 --> 02:57:20,083
And we should end all this nonsense.

1063
02:57:20,083 --> 02:57:23,792
You want to pull my leg?

1064
02:57:23,792 --> 02:57:25,667
What?

1065
02:57:26,583 --> 02:57:29,333
How do you say...?

1066
02:57:31,041 --> 02:57:32,750
(English) What I want

1067
02:57:33,375 --> 02:57:36,750
Whats most important to me

1068
02:57:38,333 --> 02:57:40,417
Is that I have a guarantee

1069
02:57:40,542 --> 02:57:42,750
No more attempts on my Father's life.

1070
02:57:42,750 --> 02:57:45,625
What guarantees can I give you Mike.

1071
02:57:45,625 --> 02:57:47,583
Im the hunted one

1072
02:57:47,583 --> 02:57:51,208
I missed my chance
You think to much of me kid

1073
02:57:51,208 --> 02:57:53,667
I'm not that clever

1074
02:57:54,458 --> 02:57:58,250
All I want is a truce

1075
02:58:03,208 --> 02:58:06,083
I have to go to the bathroom

1076
02:58:06,083 --> 02:58:08,291
is that alright?

1077
02:58:08,667 --> 02:58:10,417
You gotta go, you gotta go

1078
02:58:16,667 --> 02:58:18,583
I frisked him, he's clean

1079
02:58:18,583 --> 02:58:21,000
Don’t take too long

1080
02:58:23,750 --> 02:58:26,083
I frisked a thousand young punks

1081
02:59:41,625 --> 02:59:45,208
(Italian) Do you feel better? - Yes

1082
02:59:45,208 --> 02:59:47,542
Mikey, you understand me, don't you?

1083
02:59:47,542 --> 02:59:50,750
You're Italian, just like your father (aren't you?)

1084
02:59:51,542 --> 02:59:54,417
Your father is doing badly.

1085
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:03,458
When he is in better health, we'll try and arrange a meeting
meeting (or "form an union") and bring everything into balance..

1086
03:00:03,458 --> 03:00:07,000
This bullshit must end.

1087
03:03:16,041 --> 03:03:18,291
Okay, you take over.

1088
03:03:35,250 --> 03:03:38,250
I love you, Grandpa.

1089
03:03:39,792 --> 03:03:43,166
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

1090
03:03:43,959 --> 03:03:47,041
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

1091
03:03:47,250 --> 03:03:53,500
"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

1092
03:03:56,667 --> 03:03:58,792
Go with your mother.

1093
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,458
Take them downstairs.

1094
03:04:07,166 --> 03:04:09,667
Go on, Carlo, you too.

1095
03:04:10,875 --> 03:04:12,583
Go on.

1096
03:04:32,875 --> 03:04:37,041
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

1097
03:04:52,625 --> 03:04:59,000
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

1098
03:05:00,375 --> 03:05:05,458
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

1099
03:05:05,667 --> 03:05:09,083
They hit us, so we hit them back.

1100
03:05:09,583 --> 03:05:14,166
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

1101
03:05:14,375 --> 03:05:18,667
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

1102
03:05:18,875 --> 03:05:21,041
So things are loosening up.

1103
03:05:22,041 --> 03:05:29,667
And I sent Fredo to Las Vegas, under
the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.

1104
03:05:29,875 --> 03:05:35,625
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

1105
03:05:41,875 --> 03:05:43,917
Where's Michael?

1106
03:05:56,458 --> 03:05:59,375
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

1107
03:06:01,500 --> 03:06:05,875
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

1108
03:06:26,875 --> 03:06:31,500
Did you find out where that old pimp
Tattaglia is hiding? I want him now.

1109
03:06:31,709 --> 03:06:34,792
Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.

1110
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:39,834
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

1111
03:06:40,041 --> 03:06:45,792
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

1112
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:49,834
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

1113
03:06:50,041 --> 03:06:55,000
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

1114
03:06:55,208 --> 03:07:00,875
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!

1115
03:07:01,083 --> 03:07:04,166
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

1116
03:07:06,625 --> 03:07:09,166
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

1117
03:07:10,291 --> 03:07:13,458
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

1118
03:07:14,083 --> 03:07:18,583
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

1119
03:07:18,834 --> 03:07:22,750
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50 per cent on a bet.

1120
03:07:22,959 --> 03:07:26,041
That's because they've started
making big money.

1121
03:07:26,250 --> 03:07:29,667
Poppa never talked business
at the table.

1122
03:07:29,875 --> 03:07:34,333
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

1123
03:07:34,542 --> 03:07:37,375
Don't interfere.

1124
03:07:37,583 --> 03:07:41,709
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

1125
03:07:41,917 --> 03:07:44,750
We don't discuss business at the table.

1126
03:10:26,375 --> 03:10:27,750
Big Shot

1127
03:10:41,417 --> 03:10:44,417
Hey,
Take me to the America!

1128
03:10:45,667 --> 03:10:49,083
If you need a good
gunfighter in America, take me!

1129
03:10:49,083 --> 03:10:51,792
I'd be the best
Man you can got.

1130
03:12:58,041 --> 03:13:01,750
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!

1131
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:05,709
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable!

1132
03:13:06,458 --> 03:13:12,000
America! Take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

1133
03:16:05,959 --> 03:16:09,041
I apologize if I offended you.

1134
03:16:09,250 --> 03:16:12,208
I'm a stranger in this country.

1135
03:16:12,375 --> 03:16:15,834
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

1136
03:16:21,125 --> 03:16:23,750
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

1137
03:16:25,208 --> 03:16:28,041
My name is Michael Corleone.

1138
03:16:29,583 --> 03:16:33,709
There are people who'd pay a lot
of money for that information.

1139
03:16:35,750 --> 03:16:39,166
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

1140
03:16:40,542 --> 03:16:43,375
...instead of gaining a husband.

1141
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:53,875
I want to meet your daughter.

1142
03:16:54,083 --> 03:16:58,667
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

1143
03:16:59,208 --> 03:17:02,083
With all respect.

1144
03:18:39,250 --> 03:18:40,542
<i>Grazie</i>

1145
03:18:41,917 --> 03:18:42,959
<i>Prego</i>

1146
03:20:13,291 --> 03:20:15,917
I'll knock you dizzy.

1147
03:20:21,250 --> 03:20:23,667
Save it for the library.

1148
03:20:27,041 --> 03:20:29,834
We've got to pick up my sister.

1149
03:20:47,667 --> 03:20:50,291
What's the matter?

1150
03:20:51,917 --> 03:20:53,625
What's the matter?

1151
03:20:55,375 --> 03:20:57,917
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

1152
03:20:58,125 --> 03:21:00,875
It was my fault. I hit him.

1153
03:21:01,083 --> 03:21:05,625
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

1154
03:21:09,125 --> 03:21:13,000
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

1155
03:21:13,208 --> 03:21:16,291
Sonny, please don't do anything.

1156
03:21:16,500 --> 03:21:19,583
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

1157
03:21:19,792 --> 03:21:22,709
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

1158
03:21:27,125 --> 03:21:30,125
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

1159
03:21:30,333 --> 03:21:33,667
Tell them to stop taking in action.

1160
03:21:33,875 --> 03:21:35,959
We lost enough money last week.

1161
03:21:42,792 --> 03:21:44,917
Come here, come here!

1162
03:22:41,750 --> 03:22:44,959
If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

1163
03:26:38,333 --> 03:26:42,458
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

1164
03:26:42,667 --> 03:26:46,834
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

1165
03:26:47,041 --> 03:26:50,792
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

1166
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:54,083
All we know is that he's all right.

1167
03:26:55,917 --> 03:27:00,041
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

1168
03:27:01,125 --> 03:27:06,333
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

1169
03:27:06,583 --> 03:27:12,041
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

1170
03:27:12,250 --> 03:27:14,542
He'll get in touch with you.

1171
03:27:14,750 --> 03:27:18,291
I let my cab go, so can I call
another one, please?

1172
03:27:18,500 --> 03:27:20,542
Come on. Sorry.

1173
03:27:39,750 --> 03:27:42,834
- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?

1174
03:27:43,041 --> 03:27:45,375
- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.

1175
03:27:45,583 --> 03:27:49,208
Tell him that I can't make it tonight
until later.

1176
03:27:54,750 --> 03:27:56,625
Bitch!

1177
03:28:03,208 --> 03:28:04,667
Carlo!

1178
03:28:07,083 --> 03:28:09,083
Your girlfriend
just called.

1179
03:28:09,083 --> 03:28:11,166
She said she can't
make it this evening!

1180
03:28:11,166 --> 03:28:13,208
What girlfriend?
I don't have
a girlfriend.

1181
03:28:13,208 --> 03:28:15,500
Can't I take
a shower in
my own house?

1182
03:28:15,542 --> 03:28:19,083
I just talked to her
on the telephone!
What's going on?

1183
03:28:19,083 --> 03:28:21,125
Are you starting
in today?

1184
03:28:21,125 --> 03:28:22,583
Aw, Carlo...
What's the matter
with you?

1185
03:28:22,583 --> 03:28:24,750
you give your whores
my telephone number?

1186
03:28:24,750 --> 03:28:26,375
You're getting to
be a little too much.

1187
03:28:26,375 --> 03:28:28,208
Where do you think
you're going?

1188
03:28:28,208 --> 03:28:29,208
I'm going out.

1189
03:28:29,208 --> 03:28:31,583
You're not going..
you're staying home!

1190
03:28:32,041 --> 03:28:33,500
Then make me something
to eat at least

1191
03:28:33,500 --> 03:28:35,667
And let me finish
washing up!

1192
03:28:35,667 --> 03:28:37,041
Now come on, get out
of here.

1193
03:28:37,041 --> 03:28:40,041
Go in the kitchen and
make me something to eat.

1194
03:28:46,375 --> 03:28:48,041
Your dinner's ready.

1195
03:28:48,041 --> 03:28:49,542
- I’m not hungry yet.
- Its on the table

1196
03:28:49,542 --> 03:28:50,625
It's getting cold.

1197
03:28:50,625 --> 03:28:52,250
I'll eat out.

1198
03:28:52,250 --> 03:28:54,083
You just told me to make you dinner!

1199
03:28:54,083 --> 03:28:55,375
(Shouting in Italian)

1200
03:28:56,083 --> 03:28:57,500
Leave me alone!

1201
03:28:57,500 --> 03:28:59,542
<i>I'll vafangool you!</i>

1202
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:09,834
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

1203
03:29:14,083 --> 03:29:18,208
That's it, break it all, you spoiled
Guinea brat. Break it all!

1204
03:29:27,500 --> 03:29:31,125
Why don't you bring your whore
home for dinner?

1205
03:29:31,750 --> 03:29:34,625
Maybe I will.

1206
03:29:39,875 --> 03:29:42,959
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

1207
03:29:43,166 --> 03:29:47,375
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

1208
03:29:47,583 --> 03:29:51,417
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

1209
03:29:54,000 --> 03:29:57,291
Clean it up. Clean that up, you...

1210
03:29:59,875 --> 03:30:01,792
Clean it!

1211
03:30:02,000 --> 03:30:06,125
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer, like your father!

1212
03:30:06,291 --> 03:30:09,750
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

1213
03:30:09,959 --> 03:30:12,792
Come on, kill me!

1214
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:14,667
Get out of here!

1215
03:30:14,875 --> 03:30:18,083
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

1216
03:30:18,291 --> 03:30:21,375
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

1217
03:30:31,291 --> 03:30:34,875
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

1218
03:30:35,458 --> 03:30:38,458
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

1219
03:30:38,667 --> 03:30:42,208
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

1220
03:30:42,834 --> 03:30:45,208
Yeah, Connie.

1221
03:30:49,625 --> 03:30:51,667
You wait there.

1222
03:30:53,959 --> 03:30:56,500
No, you just wait there.

1223
03:30:58,709 --> 03:31:01,125
Son-of-a-bitch.

1224
03:31:01,291 --> 03:31:04,375
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

1225
03:31:08,166 --> 03:31:11,750
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

1226
03:31:19,291 --> 03:31:20,959
Sonny!

1227
03:31:27,125 --> 03:31:29,792
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

1228
03:31:30,166 --> 03:31:32,291
Go after him, go on!

1229
03:32:01,667 --> 03:32:05,291
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

1230
03:33:52,542 --> 03:33:54,583
Give me a drop.

1231
03:34:02,709 --> 03:34:05,792
My wife is crying upstairs.

1232
03:34:07,375 --> 03:34:10,625
I hear cars coming to the house.

1233
03:34:14,417 --> 03:34:17,500
Consigliere of mine,

1234
03:34:17,709 --> 03:34:21,083
tell your Don what everyone
seems to know.

1235
03:34:21,291 --> 03:34:23,875
I didn't tell Mama anything.

1236
03:34:24,625 --> 03:34:28,417
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

1237
03:34:31,166 --> 03:34:33,458
But you needed a drink first.

1238
03:34:36,000 --> 03:34:37,792
Yeah.

1239
03:34:40,291 --> 03:34:43,208
Well, now you've had your drink.

1240
03:34:48,333 --> 03:34:52,834
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

1241
03:35:09,792 --> 03:35:12,542
I want no inquiries made.

1242
03:35:16,417 --> 03:35:19,166
I want no acts of vengeance.

1243
03:35:20,542 --> 03:35:23,083
I want you to arrange a meeting...

1244
03:35:24,291 --> 03:35:27,417
...with the heads of the five families.

1245
03:35:28,959 --> 03:35:31,542
This war stops now.

1246
03:35:52,959 --> 03:35:55,250
Call Bonasera.

1247
03:35:55,500 --> 03:35:58,000
I need him now.

1248
03:36:09,917 --> 03:36:15,083
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Vito Corleone, at his request.

1249
03:36:16,041 --> 03:36:20,125
Last year they were killing one another.

1250
03:36:20,250 --> 03:36:22,542
So now what?

1251
03:36:23,041 --> 03:36:27,417
The Godfather
comes to me.

1252
03:36:29,542 --> 03:36:31,417
Why?

1253
03:36:31,500 --> 03:36:34,291
They have killed
someone so important

1254
03:36:34,291 --> 03:36:37,041
that they wish to
make his body disappear.

1255
03:36:37,041 --> 03:36:38,375
Amerigo

1256
03:36:39,375 --> 03:36:41,625
They could make me
an accomplice

1257
03:36:41,625 --> 03:36:44,458
to their murder.

1258
03:36:45,000 --> 03:36:48,709
They could send me
to prison.

1259
03:36:51,625 --> 03:36:56,583
And if the other families,
find out

1260
03:36:56,583 --> 03:37:01,750
They will make me
their enemy.

1261
03:37:02,667 --> 03:37:05,583
I curse the day

1262
03:37:05,583 --> 03:37:10,375
<i>when you and Comare Corleone became friends.</i>

1263
03:37:40,208 --> 03:37:45,041
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

1264
03:37:45,250 --> 03:37:49,417
Yes. What do you want me to do?

1265
03:37:56,500 --> 03:38:01,667
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

1266
03:38:05,166 --> 03:38:08,458
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

1267
03:38:24,208 --> 03:38:27,458
Look how they massacred my boy.

1268
03:39:01,625 --> 03:39:06,792
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

1269
03:40:42,125 --> 03:40:46,291
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

1270
03:40:46,500 --> 03:40:50,041
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

1271
03:40:50,250 --> 03:40:52,667
Okay, anything you say.

1272
03:41:22,542 --> 03:41:25,000
Fabrizio!

1273
03:41:36,834 --> 03:41:38,208
No, Apollonia!

1274
03:42:51,458 --> 03:42:57,125
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organise this meeting,

1275
03:42:57,333 --> 03:43:02,625
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

1276
03:43:03,834 --> 03:43:06,917
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

1277
03:43:07,125 --> 03:43:10,667
and from Brooklyn...

1278
03:43:12,041 --> 03:43:14,375
...Philip Tattaglia.

1279
03:43:15,709 --> 03:43:18,667
And from Staten Island

1280
03:43:18,875 --> 03:43:22,250
we have with us Victor Strachi.

1281
03:43:22,458 --> 03:43:28,208
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

1282
03:43:28,417 --> 03:43:32,458
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

1283
03:43:38,625 --> 03:43:41,959
How did things ever get so far?

1284
03:43:42,166 --> 03:43:44,208
I don't know.

1285
03:43:45,875 --> 03:43:50,166
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

1286
03:43:52,458 --> 03:43:56,333
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

1287
03:43:58,333 --> 03:44:01,834
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

1288
03:44:02,041 --> 03:44:06,041
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

1289
03:44:07,333 --> 03:44:10,917
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

1290
03:44:11,125 --> 03:44:16,250
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

1291
03:44:16,458 --> 03:44:20,375
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

1292
03:44:20,583 --> 03:44:23,917
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

1293
03:44:24,875 --> 03:44:27,959
He refused to share them.

1294
03:44:28,166 --> 03:44:31,667
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

1295
03:44:31,875 --> 03:44:34,417
All of you know me.

1296
03:44:35,125 --> 03:44:40,458
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

1297
03:44:41,959 --> 03:44:47,792
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

1298
03:44:48,000 --> 03:44:51,875
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

1299
03:44:52,083 --> 03:44:58,125
<i>which is something that most people
want nowadays, and is forbidden to them
by the pezzonovante of the Church.</i>

1300
03:44:58,333 --> 03:45:03,000
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

1301
03:45:03,208 --> 03:45:07,250
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1302
03:45:07,458 --> 03:45:12,458
I believed that then...
and I believe that now.

1303
03:45:12,667 --> 03:45:14,750
Times have changed.

1304
03:45:14,959 --> 03:45:19,625
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

1305
03:45:19,834 --> 03:45:22,583
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1306
03:45:22,792 --> 03:45:28,208
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

1307
03:45:28,417 --> 03:45:33,250
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

1308
03:45:33,875 --> 03:45:37,458
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

1309
03:45:37,667 --> 03:45:40,583
After all, we're not communists.

1310
03:45:43,166 --> 03:45:46,250
I also don't believe in drugs.

1311
03:45:46,458 --> 03:45:51,250
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

1312
03:45:51,458 --> 03:45:54,542
Somebody says to them
"I have powders."

1313
03:45:54,750 --> 03:46:01,875
"If you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment,
we can make 50,000 distributing."

1314
03:46:02,083 --> 03:46:07,917
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

1315
03:46:08,083 --> 03:46:13,041
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

1316
03:46:13,250 --> 03:46:16,041
That's an infàmia.

1317
03:46:16,250 --> 03:46:20,041
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the coloured.

1318
03:46:20,250 --> 03:46:23,333
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

1319
03:46:30,041 --> 03:46:34,166
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1320
03:46:34,959 --> 03:46:42,000
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

1321
03:46:42,208 --> 03:46:46,709
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1322
03:46:46,917 --> 03:46:51,333
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

1323
03:46:51,542 --> 03:46:54,917
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1324
03:46:55,125 --> 03:46:58,583
As time goes by and his position
becomes stronger,

1325
03:46:58,792 --> 03:47:01,250
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

1326
03:47:01,458 --> 03:47:06,625
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

1327
03:47:06,834 --> 03:47:09,041
You talk about vengeance.

1328
03:47:09,250 --> 03:47:12,333
Will vengeance bring your son
back to you?

1329
03:47:12,542 --> 03:47:15,291
Or my boy to me?

1330
03:47:15,458 --> 03:47:18,583
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

1331
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:24,000
But I have selfish reasons.

1332
03:47:25,458 --> 03:47:29,625
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country...

1333
03:47:31,000 --> 03:47:34,000
...because of this Sollozzo business.

1334
03:47:34,208 --> 03:47:39,000
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

1335
03:47:39,208 --> 03:47:41,917
Cleared of all these false charges.

1336
03:47:43,291 --> 03:47:46,333
But I'm a superstitious man.

1337
03:47:46,542 --> 03:47:53,000
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

1338
03:47:53,208 --> 03:47:56,667
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

1339
03:47:56,875 --> 03:48:00,792
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

1340
03:48:01,000 --> 03:48:05,125
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1341
03:48:06,083 --> 03:48:08,917
And that I do not forgive.

1342
03:48:11,083 --> 03:48:13,709
But, that aside...

1343
03:48:16,417 --> 03:48:19,208
...let me say that I swear...

1344
03:48:20,458 --> 03:48:23,542
...on the souls of my grandchildren,

1345
03:48:23,750 --> 03:48:28,625
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1346
03:48:53,458 --> 03:48:58,959
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1347
03:48:59,166 --> 03:49:02,000
Mention it. Don't insist.

1348
03:49:03,291 --> 03:49:08,333
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

1349
03:49:09,834 --> 03:49:15,250
Tattaglia's a pimp. He could never
have outfought Santino.

1350
03:49:18,542 --> 03:49:24,667
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1351
03:49:34,041 --> 03:49:36,041
Lettuce...

1352
03:49:36,333 --> 03:49:39,000
Tomatoes, Pepper

1353
03:49:39,000 --> 03:49:41,208
Flowers.

1354
03:49:41,208 --> 03:49:43,583
Eight...

1355
03:49:46,583 --> 03:49:48,417
Fig trees.

1356
03:49:48,583 --> 03:49:50,125
- Beautiful.
- Pop...

1357
03:49:50,125 --> 03:49:52,500
What about Sonny?

1358
03:49:54,583 --> 03:49:57,583
What about Sicily?

1359
03:50:01,667 --> 03:50:06,125
I swore that I would
never break the peace.

1360
03:50:06,250 --> 03:50:10,333
But won't they take that
as a sign of weakness?

1361
03:50:10,417 --> 03:50:14,375
It is a sign
of weakness.

1362
03:50:17,250 --> 03:50:19,542
You gave your word that
you wouldn't break the peace.

1363
03:50:19,542 --> 03:50:22,291
I didn't give mine.

1364
03:50:22,291 --> 03:50:25,000
You don't have
to have any part in it.

1365
03:50:25,000 --> 03:50:28,667
I take all responsibility.

1366
03:50:32,083 --> 03:50:38,792
Well.. we have a lot of time
to talk about it now.

1367
03:50:49,333 --> 03:50:51,500
Come on, Nancy.

1368
03:50:52,709 --> 03:50:55,875
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

1369
03:50:56,625 --> 03:50:58,792
Okay, all right.

1370
03:51:11,667 --> 03:51:14,250
How long have you been back?

1371
03:51:14,458 --> 03:51:16,500
I've been back a year.

1372
03:51:17,792 --> 03:51:20,542
Longer than that, I think.

1373
03:51:22,375 --> 03:51:24,875
It's good to see you, Kay.

1374
03:51:35,709 --> 03:51:38,792
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1375
03:51:40,834 --> 03:51:44,166
He's been sick. Very sick.

1376
03:51:45,333 --> 03:51:51,875
But you're not like him. You told me you
weren't going to become like your father.

1377
03:51:53,083 --> 03:51:57,458
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1378
03:51:57,667 --> 03:52:02,083
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1379
03:52:02,291 --> 03:52:04,500
Like a senator or president.

1380
03:52:04,709 --> 03:52:07,208
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

1381
03:52:07,417 --> 03:52:10,250
They don't have men killed.

1382
03:52:13,125 --> 03:52:15,417
Who's being naive, Kay?

1383
03:52:16,709 --> 03:52:22,166
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1384
03:52:22,375 --> 03:52:27,500
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1385
03:52:28,375 --> 03:52:33,000
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1386
03:52:33,750 --> 03:52:37,458
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1387
03:52:38,291 --> 03:52:43,041
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1388
03:52:43,250 --> 03:52:46,667
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1389
03:52:46,792 --> 03:52:51,500
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1390
03:52:52,375 --> 03:52:55,500
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

1391
03:52:56,625 --> 03:53:00,834
I'll do anything you ask to make up for
what's happened to us.

1392
03:53:02,625 --> 03:53:08,125
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that...

1393
03:53:08,333 --> 03:53:12,834
...we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1394
03:53:13,041 --> 03:53:16,375
That we have children. Our children.

1395
03:53:17,500 --> 03:53:20,375
Kay, I need you.

1396
03:53:21,500 --> 03:53:23,875
And I love you.

1397
03:53:45,208 --> 03:53:48,959
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1398
03:53:49,166 --> 03:53:52,625
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1399
03:53:52,834 --> 03:53:55,917
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1400
03:53:56,083 --> 03:53:59,166
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1401
03:53:59,375 --> 03:54:02,750
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1402
03:54:02,959 --> 03:54:08,000
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1403
03:54:08,208 --> 03:54:09,917
Don Corleone...

1404
03:54:10,166 --> 03:54:14,583
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1405
03:54:14,792 --> 03:54:19,125
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1406
03:54:19,333 --> 03:54:22,375
Michael is now head of the family.

1407
03:54:22,583 --> 03:54:26,750
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1408
03:54:26,959 --> 03:54:29,000
After we make the move to Nevada

1409
03:54:29,208 --> 03:54:33,709
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1410
03:54:33,917 --> 03:54:38,041
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1411
03:54:38,250 --> 03:54:44,333
Forgive me, but with you gone, me and
Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.

1412
03:54:44,500 --> 03:54:50,000
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1413
03:54:50,208 --> 03:54:53,208
- Do you have faith in my judgement?
- Yes.

1414
03:54:53,417 --> 03:54:56,208
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1415
03:54:56,375 --> 03:54:59,834
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1416
03:55:04,291 --> 03:55:09,750
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1417
03:55:09,959 --> 03:55:12,875
That's all I can tell you now.

1418
03:55:13,083 --> 03:55:15,375
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1419
03:55:15,583 --> 03:55:18,959
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1420
03:55:19,166 --> 03:55:23,834
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1421
03:55:24,041 --> 03:55:27,500
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1422
03:55:27,709 --> 03:55:32,625
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1423
03:55:50,959 --> 03:55:54,500
- Thank you, Poppa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1424
03:55:56,166 --> 03:55:59,625
Michael, why are you
cutting me out
of the action?

1425
03:55:59,625 --> 03:56:02,709
We're gonna be legitimate
all the way, Tom.
You're the legal man.

1426
03:56:02,709 --> 03:56:04,125
What's more important
than that?

1427
03:56:04,125 --> 03:56:05,333
I'm not talking
about that.

1428
03:56:05,333 --> 03:56:09,083
Im talking about Rocco Lampone's building a secret regime.

1429
03:56:09,083 --> 03:56:12,792
Now why does Neri report directly
to you, instead of through me?
or the Capo Regimes?

1430
03:56:12,792 --> 03:56:13,792
How'd you find that out?

1431
03:56:13,792 --> 03:56:16,250
Rocco's men are a little too good for their jobs.

1432
03:56:16,250 --> 03:56:18,333
They're geting more
money than the job's worth.

1433
03:56:18,333 --> 03:56:22,250
I told you this
wouldn't escape
his eye.

1434
03:56:22,417 --> 03:56:26,250
Mike, Why am I out?

1435
03:56:26,500 --> 03:56:30,000
<i>You're not a wartime consigliori, Tom.</i>

1436
03:56:30,458 --> 03:56:33,792
Things may get rough
with the move we're trying.

1437
03:56:34,041 --> 03:56:36,375
Tom.

1438
03:56:40,500 --> 03:56:45,667
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1439
03:56:45,875 --> 03:56:51,250
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1440
03:56:51,458 --> 03:56:55,500
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1441
03:56:55,750 --> 03:57:01,208
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1442
03:57:01,417 --> 03:57:05,041
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1443
03:57:17,542 --> 03:57:20,625
I want to be
alone with my father.

1444
03:57:32,250 --> 03:57:36,083
I think you found
your Luca Brasi.

1445
03:57:36,083 --> 03:57:38,208
I'll need him.

1446
03:58:13,750 --> 03:58:16,583
I can't get over
the way your face looks.

1447
03:58:16,583 --> 03:58:18,333
it really
looks good.

1448
03:58:18,333 --> 03:58:19,750
This doctor
did some job.

1449
03:58:19,750 --> 03:58:21,250
Who talked you into it? Kay?

1450
03:58:21,250 --> 03:58:23,542
Hey, Hey!
Leave them here.

1451
03:58:23,542 --> 03:58:25,125
We'll deal
with that later.

1452
03:58:25,375 --> 03:58:29,375
He’s tired, wants to clean up.
Let me open the door alright?

1453
03:58:35,667 --> 03:58:41,375
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1454
03:58:41,583 --> 03:58:44,333
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1455
03:58:47,667 --> 03:58:51,333
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1456
03:58:52,125 --> 03:58:56,583
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1457
03:58:56,750 --> 03:59:00,917
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

1458
03:59:01,834 --> 03:59:06,542
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1459
03:59:06,750 --> 03:59:10,041
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1460
03:59:15,208 --> 03:59:18,291
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

1461
03:59:18,500 --> 03:59:21,583
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1462
03:59:22,375 --> 03:59:24,875
Hey, come on! Scram!

1463
03:59:26,166 --> 03:59:30,625
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

1464
03:59:30,834 --> 03:59:32,917
Sorry.

1465
03:59:33,125 --> 03:59:35,834
I don't know. He's tired.

1466
03:59:42,667 --> 03:59:45,625
What happened to Moe Greene?

1467
03:59:45,834 --> 03:59:50,208
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1468
03:59:50,417 --> 03:59:52,750
Well, give him a call.

1469
03:59:53,583 --> 03:59:56,917
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1470
03:59:57,125 --> 03:59:59,166
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1471
03:59:59,375 --> 04:00:02,792
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1472
04:00:03,000 --> 04:00:05,709
Well, I owe it all to him.

1473
04:00:05,917 --> 04:00:11,000
He knows how grateful you are. That's
why he'd like to ask a favour of you.

1474
04:00:11,208 --> 04:00:14,041
Mike, what can I do?

1475
04:00:14,250 --> 04:00:20,291
We're thinking of giving up our interests
in the olive oil business and settle here.

1476
04:00:20,458 --> 04:00:26,375
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it. Tom!

1477
04:00:26,625 --> 04:00:31,667
Are you sure? Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1478
04:00:31,875 --> 04:00:35,166
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1479
04:00:36,041 --> 04:00:38,291
See, Johnny...

1480
04:00:38,458 --> 04:00:42,709
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1481
04:00:42,917 --> 04:00:47,041
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1482
04:00:49,333 --> 04:00:54,333
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1483
04:00:55,250 --> 04:00:57,625
We're counting on you.

1484
04:00:59,417 --> 04:01:03,291
Sure, Mike. I'll do anything
for my godfather.

1485
04:01:03,458 --> 04:01:04,959
Good.

1486
04:01:06,250 --> 04:01:10,834
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1487
04:01:11,041 --> 04:01:13,083
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1488
04:01:13,291 --> 04:01:18,458
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1489
04:01:18,667 --> 04:01:22,625
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1490
04:01:24,750 --> 04:01:27,875
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1491
04:01:29,291 --> 04:01:30,667
Buy me out?

1492
04:01:30,875 --> 04:01:36,291
The casino, the hotel. The
Corleone family wants to buy you out.

1493
04:01:36,917 --> 04:01:42,333
The Corleone family wants to
buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1494
04:01:42,542 --> 04:01:45,667
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1495
04:01:45,875 --> 04:01:50,542
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1496
04:01:54,667 --> 04:01:57,166
You Guineas make me laugh.

1497
04:01:57,375 --> 04:02:02,792
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1498
04:02:03,000 --> 04:02:06,750
You did that because we bankrolled
your casino

1499
04:02:06,959 --> 04:02:11,959
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

1500
04:02:12,166 --> 04:02:17,333
Yes. First of all, you're all done. You
don't have that kind of muscle anymore.

1501
04:02:17,542 --> 04:02:21,875
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1502
04:02:22,083 --> 04:02:25,792
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1503
04:02:26,000 --> 04:02:30,959
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1504
04:02:31,166 --> 04:02:34,542
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1505
04:02:34,750 --> 04:02:39,458
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1506
04:02:39,709 --> 04:02:43,834
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1507
04:02:44,041 --> 04:02:48,542
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

1508
04:02:48,750 --> 04:02:52,625
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

1509
04:02:52,834 --> 04:02:55,375
You straightened my brother out?

1510
04:02:55,583 --> 04:03:00,041
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1511
04:03:00,250 --> 04:03:02,625
What's wrong with you?

1512
04:03:06,834 --> 04:03:10,709
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1513
04:03:10,917 --> 04:03:12,417
Son-of-a-bitch!

1514
04:03:12,625 --> 04:03:17,959
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1515
04:03:18,166 --> 04:03:21,458
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

1516
04:03:21,709 --> 04:03:25,208
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

1517
04:03:25,417 --> 04:03:30,458
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1518
04:03:30,667 --> 04:03:34,417
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1519
04:03:37,709 --> 04:03:43,041
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1520
04:03:44,625 --> 04:03:46,667
Fredo...

1521
04:03:46,875 --> 04:03:49,959
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1522
04:03:51,000 --> 04:03:55,667
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

1523
04:04:05,834 --> 04:04:10,458
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

1524
04:04:11,709 --> 04:04:17,041
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1525
04:04:23,875 --> 04:04:26,875
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1526
04:04:27,083 --> 04:04:29,250
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1527
04:04:29,458 --> 04:04:32,125
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

1528
04:04:32,333 --> 04:04:34,417
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1529
04:04:34,625 --> 04:04:37,083
Let me think about it. Come on.

1530
04:04:45,291 --> 04:04:48,291
Barzini will move against you first.

1531
04:04:48,458 --> 04:04:52,875
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

1532
04:04:53,083 --> 04:04:56,041
Guaranteeing your safety.

1533
04:04:56,250 --> 04:04:59,750
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1534
04:05:03,917 --> 04:05:07,458
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1535
04:05:08,333 --> 04:05:12,291
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1536
04:05:17,000 --> 04:05:19,375
I don't know.

1537
04:05:20,375 --> 04:05:24,041
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

1538
04:05:24,250 --> 04:05:27,750
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1539
04:05:28,959 --> 04:05:33,875
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1540
04:05:34,083 --> 04:05:37,583
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1541
04:05:38,333 --> 04:05:41,667
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

1542
04:05:42,959 --> 04:05:46,917
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1543
04:05:49,709 --> 04:05:52,041
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1544
04:05:52,250 --> 04:05:55,208
He looks more like you every day.

1545
04:05:57,750 --> 04:06:02,250
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1546
04:06:04,166 --> 04:06:06,542
Read the funny papers.

1547
04:06:13,375 --> 04:06:19,083
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in- and out-going calls.

1548
04:06:19,291 --> 04:06:25,291
- I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

1549
04:06:28,583 --> 04:06:31,250
What's the matter?

1550
04:06:31,458 --> 04:06:33,917
What's bothering you?

1551
04:06:36,834 --> 04:06:41,583
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,
so I'll handle it.

1552
04:06:54,750 --> 04:06:58,875
I knew that Santino would have to
go through all this.

1553
04:06:59,166 --> 04:07:02,083
And Fredo...

1554
04:07:03,625 --> 04:07:05,959
Fredo was, well...

1555
04:07:07,458 --> 04:07:11,041
But I never wanted this for you.

1556
04:07:12,542 --> 04:07:17,667
I worked my whole life. I don't apologize
for taking care of my family.

1557
04:07:17,875 --> 04:07:21,750
And I refused to be a fool,

1558
04:07:21,959 --> 04:07:26,291
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1559
04:07:27,917 --> 04:07:32,041
I don't apologize. That's my life,
but I thought that...

1560
04:07:33,000 --> 04:07:38,458
...that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1561
04:07:40,083 --> 04:07:45,583
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1562
04:07:45,792 --> 04:07:48,208
Another pezzo da novanta.

1563
04:07:48,959 --> 04:07:50,417
Well...

1564
04:07:53,583 --> 04:07:57,625
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1565
04:07:57,834 --> 04:08:01,709
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

1566
04:08:06,083 --> 04:08:10,458
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

1567
04:08:10,709 --> 04:08:14,125
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

1568
04:08:30,542 --> 04:08:32,959
Can I hold it, please?

1569
04:08:47,750 --> 04:08:51,625
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1570
04:08:51,834 --> 04:08:54,959
Over here, over here.

1571
04:08:56,458 --> 04:08:59,792
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1572
04:09:05,333 --> 04:09:07,375
Antony!

1573
04:09:07,583 --> 04:09:09,667
Come here, come here.

1574
04:09:13,333 --> 04:09:16,166
That's it. We'll put it right there.

1575
04:09:22,041 --> 04:09:25,333
I'll show you something. Come here.

1576
04:09:26,583 --> 04:09:28,625
Stand there.

1577
04:09:32,041 --> 04:09:34,542
Give me an orange!

1578
04:09:52,542 --> 04:09:54,625
That's a new trick.

1579
04:09:55,208 --> 04:09:58,208
You run in there. Run in there.

1580
04:10:10,917 --> 04:10:13,250
Where are you?

1581
04:13:10,583 --> 04:13:13,458
Mike, can I have a minute?

1582
04:13:22,959 --> 04:13:25,250
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1583
04:13:25,458 --> 04:13:29,458
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1584
04:13:29,667 --> 04:13:32,792
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1585
04:13:33,000 --> 04:13:37,583
I can arrange security. On my territory.

1586
04:13:39,959 --> 04:13:43,083
- All right?
- All right.

1587
04:14:00,083 --> 04:14:03,166
Do you know how they're going to
come at you?

1588
04:14:05,458 --> 04:14:10,000
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

1589
04:14:11,166 --> 04:14:13,458
Where I'll be safe.

1590
04:14:25,333 --> 04:14:29,041
I always thought it would be
Clemenza, not Tessio.

1591
04:14:29,250 --> 04:14:33,750
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1592
04:14:35,625 --> 04:14:37,709
But I'm going to wait.

1593
04:14:37,917 --> 04:14:40,208
After the baptism.

1594
04:14:41,917 --> 04:14:44,750
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1595
04:14:45,750 --> 04:14:48,792
And then I'll meet with Don Barzini

1596
04:14:49,000 --> 04:14:54,041
and Tattaglia.
All the heads of the five families.

1597
04:17:15,583 --> 04:17:19,834
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1598
04:17:20,041 --> 04:17:21,375
I do.

1599
04:17:21,583 --> 04:17:24,959
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

1600
04:17:25,166 --> 04:17:26,458
I do.

1601
04:17:26,709 --> 04:17:30,625
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?

1602
04:17:30,834 --> 04:17:32,166
I do.

1603
04:18:37,041 --> 04:18:41,792
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1604
04:18:48,041 --> 04:18:49,375
I do renounce him.

1605
04:18:59,125 --> 04:19:00,583
And all his works?

1606
04:19:13,875 --> 04:19:15,458
I do renounce them.

1607
04:19:16,834 --> 04:19:18,375
Oh, God!

1608
04:19:21,291 --> 04:19:25,041
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1609
04:19:40,667 --> 04:19:44,458
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptised?

1610
04:19:44,667 --> 04:19:46,166
I will.

1611
04:19:53,166 --> 04:19:59,458
Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and may
the Lord be with you. Amen.

1612
04:20:12,709 --> 04:20:14,750
Kay!

1613
04:20:14,959 --> 04:20:17,041
Kiss your godfather.

1614
04:20:41,166 --> 04:20:47,000
Can't go to Vegas. Something's come
up. Everybody has to leave without us.

1615
04:20:47,208 --> 04:20:50,542
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

1616
04:20:50,750 --> 04:20:54,875
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1617
04:20:55,083 --> 04:20:57,458
I'll only be a couple of days.

1618
04:21:13,542 --> 04:21:16,458
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1619
04:21:17,792 --> 04:21:22,291
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1620
04:21:29,417 --> 04:21:34,750
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

1621
04:21:34,959 --> 04:21:38,542
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1622
04:21:38,750 --> 04:21:41,291
I can't go either, Sal.

1623
04:21:52,667 --> 04:21:57,625
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1624
04:21:57,834 --> 04:22:01,417
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1625
04:22:07,208 --> 04:22:10,458
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1626
04:22:10,667 --> 04:22:14,709
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

1627
04:22:59,417 --> 04:23:02,041
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1628
04:23:07,333 --> 04:23:11,959
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1629
04:23:12,166 --> 04:23:15,792
That little farce you played
with my sister.

1630
04:23:16,000 --> 04:23:21,041
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1631
04:23:21,250 --> 04:23:24,542
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

1632
04:23:26,750 --> 04:23:29,542
Don't do this to me, please.

1633
04:23:38,208 --> 04:23:40,458
Barzini is dead.

1634
04:23:41,959 --> 04:23:44,291
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1635
04:23:45,625 --> 04:23:47,291
Moe Greene.

1636
04:23:48,041 --> 04:23:52,375
Strachi. Cuneo.

1637
04:23:53,709 --> 04:23:58,875
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1638
04:23:59,083 --> 04:24:01,625
Admit what you did.

1639
04:24:04,750 --> 04:24:06,959
Get him a drink.

1640
04:24:12,834 --> 04:24:15,125
Come on.

1641
04:24:15,333 --> 04:24:20,458
Don't be afraid, Carlo. Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow?

1642
04:24:21,834 --> 04:24:24,917
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1643
04:24:31,458 --> 04:24:34,250
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1644
04:24:38,542 --> 04:24:43,166
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1645
04:24:43,375 --> 04:24:47,291
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1646
04:24:47,458 --> 04:24:49,041
Tom.

1647
04:24:53,125 --> 04:24:56,875
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1648
04:24:57,083 --> 04:24:59,834
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

1649
04:25:00,625 --> 04:25:05,542
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1650
04:25:09,208 --> 04:25:12,291
Who approached you?

1651
04:25:12,458 --> 04:25:15,166
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1652
04:25:22,458 --> 04:25:25,166
It was Barzini.

1653
04:25:28,458 --> 04:25:30,458
Good.

1654
04:25:36,125 --> 04:25:40,250
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1655
04:25:40,458 --> 04:25:44,333
I'll call your wife and tell her
what flight you're on.

1656
04:25:48,875 --> 04:25:51,583
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

1657
04:26:16,625 --> 04:26:18,041
Hello, Carlo.

1658
04:27:17,083 --> 04:27:21,458
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

1659
04:27:30,208 --> 04:27:31,834
Michael!

1660
04:27:32,041 --> 04:27:35,208
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1661
04:27:36,458 --> 04:27:41,500
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1662
04:27:41,709 --> 04:27:45,667
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1663
04:27:45,875 --> 04:27:48,959
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1664
04:27:49,166 --> 04:27:55,208
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1665
04:27:55,417 --> 04:27:57,125
Connie.

1666
04:27:58,750 --> 04:28:04,291
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the
Mall? He knew he was going to kill him.

1667
04:28:04,458 --> 04:28:10,000
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

1668
04:28:10,208 --> 04:28:14,291
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1669
04:28:14,458 --> 04:28:17,959
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1670
04:28:26,583 --> 04:28:30,417
No! No, no...

1671
04:28:30,625 --> 04:28:34,333
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

1672
04:28:55,333 --> 04:28:57,250
She's hysterical.

1673
04:29:01,709 --> 04:29:03,667
Hysterical.

1674
04:29:05,458 --> 04:29:08,125
Michael, is it true?

1675
04:29:09,041 --> 04:29:12,667
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1676
04:29:12,875 --> 04:29:16,625
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1677
04:29:35,625 --> 04:29:37,417
All right.

1678
04:29:39,959 --> 04:29:42,000
This one time.

1679
04:29:45,709 --> 04:29:49,834
This one time I'll let you ask me
about my affairs.

1680
04:29:55,041 --> 04:29:57,917
Is it true?

1681
04:30:00,750 --> 04:30:02,583
Is it?

1682
04:30:04,083 --> 04:30:05,583
No.

1683
04:30:19,250 --> 04:30:22,542
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

1684
04:30:53,333 --> 04:30:55,750
Don Corleone.

1685
04:32:18,000 --> 04:32:21,041
Do something exciting.
That's good

1686
04:32:21,041 --> 04:32:22,750
Here's your big chance.
Come on.

1687
04:32:28,166 --> 04:32:29,542
I don't care if you
are my husband.

1688
04:32:29,542 --> 04:32:32,333
keep your greasy hands
off of me!

1689
04:32:32,333 --> 04:32:34,250
And I will not
shut my mouth!

1690
04:32:34,250 --> 04:32:35,291
Honey, wait a minute.

1691
04:32:35,291 --> 04:32:39,083
- Let's take a drive, huh?
- I already had a drive!

1692
04:32:39,083 --> 04:32:41,583
I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.

1693
04:32:41,583 --> 04:32:43,667
I don't want him to see you
in this condition.

1694
04:32:43,667 --> 04:32:45,000
Would you park this thing, please?

1695
04:32:45,000 --> 04:32:48,125
Come on, honey, please.
Just listen to me for one minute.

1696
04:32:48,125 --> 04:32:49,458
uh-huh. Ow!

1697
04:32:49,458 --> 04:32:52,291
No! Let go of me! Ow!

1698
04:32:52,333 --> 04:32:54,625
No! Ow!

1699
04:32:54,625 --> 04:32:57,542
Ow! Do you know what you did to me?

1700
04:32:57,542 --> 04:32:59,750
Ow! Oh!

1701
04:32:59,750 --> 04:33:02,709
You listen to me.

1702
04:33:02,709 --> 04:33:05,417
Michael's got a lot of nice people here.

1703
04:33:05,417 --> 04:33:07,250
They're friends of Kay's.

1704
04:33:07,250 --> 04:33:09,166
If you ruin this party
I'll never live it down.

1705
04:33:09,166 --> 04:33:12,625
Oh yeah? How come
you're so scared of
your kid brother, anyway?

1706
04:33:12,625 --> 04:33:15,709
Because he's
the head of the family.

1707
04:33:26,417 --> 04:33:28,583
Hey did you bring your car key?

1708
04:33:31,000 --> 04:33:32,083
woman: Laurie.

1709
04:33:32,083 --> 04:33:33,500
Laurie!

1710
04:33:53,709 --> 04:33:55,458
Ma Ma

1711
04:33:56,834 --> 04:33:58,208
Ma Ma

1712
04:34:00,792 --> 04:34:03,542
- Look who's here.
- Father Carmelo.

1713
04:34:03,667 --> 04:34:05,792
- This is Father Carmelo.
- I'm Merle Johnson.

1714
04:34:05,917 --> 04:34:08,500
Nice to meet you. Hi.
Excuse me.

1715
04:34:11,625 --> 04:34:15,667
- Here I am.
- After one week?

1716
04:34:15,750 --> 04:34:19,250
I sent the car out to the airport
last week to pick you up.

1717
04:34:19,375 --> 04:34:20,750
It was chaos.

1718
04:34:20,875 --> 04:34:23,875
Anyway, here I am,
just one week late.

1719
04:34:23,959 --> 04:34:25,542
And this is for my mama.

1720
04:34:25,625 --> 04:34:28,166
- What is this?
- You remember Merle, don't you?

1721
04:34:28,291 --> 04:34:29,959
- Hello, Mama.
- Yeah, hello.

1722
04:34:30,083 --> 04:34:31,959
How are you?
Thank you.

1723
04:34:32,083 --> 04:34:33,709
Where's Michael?
I gotta talk to him...

1724
04:34:33,834 --> 04:34:37,125
and get a few things straight,
and I can't wait on line.

1725
04:34:37,208 --> 04:34:40,166
You go see your children first...

1726
04:34:40,250 --> 04:34:43,750
and then you worry about waiting
on line to see your brother...

1727
04:34:43,875 --> 04:34:46,166
Like everybody else.

1728
04:34:47,208 --> 04:34:51,041
Waiter, you got a glass
of red wine?

1729
04:34:51,041 --> 04:34:53,083
I'm sorry, only
champagne and cocktails.

1730
04:34:53,083 --> 04:34:56,625
A cold beer for my throat,
I'm very dry.

1731
04:34:56,625 --> 04:34:57,417
I'll try.

1732
04:34:57,417 --> 04:35:00,542
Hey, Frankie,
have some water.
over here.

1733
04:35:08,041 --> 04:35:10,667
Fredo, you son of a bitch!

1734
04:35:10,750 --> 04:35:12,542
You look great!

1735
04:35:12,625 --> 04:35:14,500
Frank Pentangeli!

1736
04:35:14,583 --> 04:35:17,333
I thought you was never
coming out west, you big bum.

1737
04:35:19,041 --> 04:35:21,041
I gotta check on my boys, huh?

1738
04:35:22,875 --> 04:35:24,875
- What's with the food around here?
- What's the matter?

1739
04:35:24,959 --> 04:35:26,583
Kid comes up to me
in a white jacket...

1740
04:35:26,750 --> 04:35:28,917
gives me a Ritz cracker
and a chopped liver...

1741
04:35:29,000 --> 04:35:30,750
he says "canapes."

1742
04:35:30,834 --> 04:35:33,917
I said, "Can of peas my ass!

1743
04:35:34,000 --> 04:35:36,291
That's a Ritz cracker
and chopped liver."

1744
04:35:39,458 --> 04:35:42,542
- Bring out the peppers and sausage.
- Hey, Freddie.

1745
04:35:42,667 --> 04:35:46,291
Seeing you reminds me of New York.
The old days, huh?

1746
04:35:46,417 --> 04:35:49,750
Hey, Fredo,
you remember Willi Cicci?

1747
04:35:49,834 --> 04:35:52,125
We was with old man Clemenza
in Brooklyn.

1748
04:35:55,125 --> 04:35:57,375
We were all upset about that.

1749
04:35:57,458 --> 04:35:58,792
Heart attack, huh?

1750
04:35:58,917 --> 04:36:00,792
No, there was no heart attack.

1751
04:36:03,041 --> 04:36:06,500
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

1752
04:36:06,625 --> 04:36:09,542
- But what's with him?
- What do you mean?

1753
04:36:09,667 --> 04:36:11,625
I mean, what do I gotta do?
Do I have to get...

1754
04:36:11,709 --> 04:36:15,083
a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?

1755
04:36:15,208 --> 04:36:16,667
You can't get in to see Mike?

1756
04:36:16,750 --> 04:36:19,542
He's got me waiting in a lobby!

1757
04:36:20,041 --> 04:36:22,375
Michael, this is Gardner Shaw.

1758
04:36:22,375 --> 04:36:24,375
Francesca and he have
been seeing each other.

1759
04:36:24,375 --> 04:36:26,458
for six months now.

1760
04:36:26,458 --> 04:36:29,125
Gardner, this is Francesca's
Uncle Michael.

1761
04:36:29,125 --> 04:36:30,333
- How do you do, sir?
- Hello.

1762
04:36:30,333 --> 04:36:33,125
I've heard a lot about you,
Mr. Corleone.

1763
04:36:33,417 --> 04:36:35,583
They would like to
set an engagement date.

1764
04:36:35,583 --> 04:36:37,583
I was thinking that
perhaps two months...

1765
04:36:37,583 --> 04:36:41,458
Let them.
Let them talk
for themselves.

1766
04:36:41,583 --> 04:36:43,083
Why don't you sit down.

1767
04:36:43,083 --> 04:36:45,041
Yes, sir. Thank you.

1768
04:36:48,709 --> 04:36:51,291
Francesca, how are you?

1769
04:36:51,291 --> 04:36:53,542
Fine. Thank you,
Uncle Michael.

1770
04:36:53,542 --> 04:36:55,291
Michael: And what
do you want to tell me?

1771
04:36:55,291 --> 04:36:59,709
Well, Uncle Michael,
we love each other very much,

1772
04:36:59,709 --> 04:37:01,750
And we want to be married.

1773
04:37:01,750 --> 04:37:05,083
I came to ask
for your blessing.

1774
04:37:05,083 --> 04:37:06,208
Fredo: Hey, Mike,
Guess who's here?

1775
04:37:06,208 --> 04:37:07,500
Not now, Freddie.

1776
04:37:09,083 --> 04:37:11,667
Tell Mike old Frankie
'Five-Angels' is outside,
all right?

1777
04:37:11,667 --> 04:37:13,542
- I'll tell him.
- What's going on?

1778
04:37:13,583 --> 04:37:15,375
Family matter.

1779
04:37:19,208 --> 04:37:21,250
You see, Gardner,

1780
04:37:21,250 --> 04:37:24,291
Francesca is my
oldest brother's daughter.

1781
04:37:24,291 --> 04:37:28,208
and my brother Sonny
died many years ago

1782
04:37:28,208 --> 04:37:30,709
and I've been sort of a father to her,

1783
04:37:30,709 --> 04:37:32,417
rather than an uncle.

1784
04:37:32,417 --> 04:37:33,667
I love her very much.

1785
04:37:33,667 --> 04:37:35,458
So do I.

1786
04:37:37,083 --> 04:37:38,417
Well, I appreciate
you coming here

1787
04:37:38,417 --> 04:37:40,291
before you went ahead
with your plans.

1788
04:37:40,291 --> 04:37:42,166
it shows you're
a considerate man.

1789
04:37:42,166 --> 04:37:45,083
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1790
04:37:45,083 --> 04:37:47,458
- Do you go to college?
- Yes, sir, I do.

1791
04:37:47,458 --> 04:37:50,625
- What do you study there?
- Fine arts.

1792
04:37:51,041 --> 04:37:56,041
How do you plan to support
your new wife on fine arts?

1793
04:37:56,458 --> 04:37:59,041
That's a good question.

1794
04:37:59,417 --> 04:38:01,250
Well, I'm sorry,

1795
04:38:01,250 --> 04:38:02,583
I just get embarrassed
to say it, sir,

1796
04:38:02,583 --> 04:38:06,792
But I'm a major stockholder
in the family corporation.

1797
04:38:06,792 --> 04:38:10,250
You shouldn't be
embarrassed about your wealth.

1798
04:38:10,500 --> 04:38:12,750
This contempt for money is
just another trick of the rich

1799
04:38:12,750 --> 04:38:15,458
to keep the poor without it.

1800
04:38:18,583 --> 04:38:21,125
Well, what can I say
after that?

1801
04:38:21,125 --> 04:38:23,375
Of course you
have my blessing.

1802
04:38:23,375 --> 04:38:24,583
Thank you.

1803
04:38:24,625 --> 04:38:26,500
I'm so happy for you.

1804
04:38:26,500 --> 04:38:29,041
Don't you worry,
You're going to be next.

1805
04:38:29,667 --> 04:38:30,583
Congratulations.

1806
04:38:30,583 --> 04:38:31,709
Thank you, sir.

1807
04:38:31,709 --> 04:38:33,417
You might consider
taking a course

1808
04:38:33,417 --> 04:38:37,583
in business administration,
just to be on the safe side.

1809
04:38:49,333 --> 04:38:51,750
Make sure her dowry is big.

1810
04:38:52,083 --> 04:38:54,291
He comes from a family
who think italian brides

1811
04:38:54,291 --> 04:38:55,291
go barefoot.

1812
04:38:55,375 --> 04:38:57,333
Kay! Aunt Kay!

1813
04:38:57,417 --> 04:39:01,458
Uncle Michael is the most
wonderful man ever!

1814
04:39:10,709 --> 04:39:13,333
His name is Fred Vincent.

1815
04:39:13,333 --> 04:39:16,333
Runs a small pizza parlor
up in Buffalo.

1816
04:39:16,333 --> 04:39:19,250
American wife, two small kids.

1817
04:39:19,250 --> 04:39:21,041
We traced him back,

1818
04:39:21,041 --> 04:39:24,250
found that he's in this country
illegally from Sicily.

1819
04:39:24,250 --> 04:39:28,583
Came over around 1956.

1820
04:39:29,333 --> 04:39:32,625
Sponsored by
the Barzini Family.

1821
04:39:40,250 --> 04:39:41,625
That's him.

1822
04:39:42,083 --> 04:39:43,667
Fabrizio.

1823
04:39:44,542 --> 04:39:47,125
What took so long?

1824
04:39:53,667 --> 04:39:56,000
My God!
I can't believe...

1825
04:39:56,125 --> 04:39:58,208
out of 30 professional musicians...

1826
04:39:58,333 --> 04:40:00,750
there isn't one ltalian
in the group here.

1827
04:40:00,834 --> 04:40:02,750
Come on.
Let's have a tarantella.

1828
04:40:09,208 --> 04:40:11,250
You, up! Come on!
Up, up, up!

1829
04:40:45,208 --> 04:40:47,291
I'll see my sister alone.

1830
04:40:47,417 --> 04:40:50,291
It concerns me too.
Is it okay if I stay?

1831
04:40:50,417 --> 04:40:52,125
How are you, honey?

1832
04:40:52,250 --> 04:40:55,375
You've met Merle.
He was with me in Vegas.

1833
04:40:55,458 --> 04:40:58,291
- I saw him with you.
- Could I have a drink or something?

1834
04:41:02,959 --> 04:41:04,792
Al, would you please
get him a drink?

1835
04:41:07,417 --> 04:41:10,792
We're going to Europe. I'd like
to book passage on the Queen.

1836
04:41:10,875 --> 04:41:13,667
So what do you come to me for?
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

1837
04:41:13,750 --> 04:41:15,583
We're getting married first.

1838
04:41:25,166 --> 04:41:28,250
The ink on your divorce isn't dry
yet, and you're getting married?

1839
04:41:31,667 --> 04:41:34,250
You see your children on weekends.

1840
04:41:34,333 --> 04:41:36,750
Your oldest boy
was picked up in Reno...

1841
04:41:36,834 --> 04:41:39,083
for some petty theft
you don't even know about.

1842
04:41:39,166 --> 04:41:42,291
You fly around the world with men
who use you like a whore.

1843
04:41:42,417 --> 04:41:45,125
- You're not my father!
- Then what do you come to me for?

1844
04:41:45,208 --> 04:41:46,750
'Cause I need money.

1845
04:42:09,583 --> 04:42:11,500
I wanna be reasonable with you.

1846
04:42:13,166 --> 04:42:15,500
Now, why don't you stay here
with us, with the family?

1847
04:42:17,166 --> 04:42:19,875
You can live here on the estate
with your kids.

1848
04:42:20,000 --> 04:42:23,500
You won't be deprived of anything.
You can have everything you want.

1849
04:42:27,125 --> 04:42:30,875
Now, I don't know this Merle.
I don't know what he does.

1850
04:42:30,959 --> 04:42:32,875
I don't know what he lives on.

1851
04:42:34,625 --> 04:42:36,500
Tell him marriage
is out of the question...

1852
04:42:36,625 --> 04:42:39,667
and you don't want
to see him anymore.

1853
04:42:39,792 --> 04:42:42,208
He'll understand.
Believe me.

1854
04:42:54,625 --> 04:42:56,959
If you don't listen to me...

1855
04:42:57,041 --> 04:42:58,959
and marry this man...

1856
04:43:03,166 --> 04:43:05,375
you'll disappoint me.

1857
04:43:55,166 --> 04:43:57,417
-Johnny Ola.
- AI Neri.

1858
04:44:04,000 --> 04:44:05,500
Do you know my lawyer
Tom Hagen? Johnny Ola.

1859
04:44:05,583 --> 04:44:09,208
Sure. I remember Tom
from the old days.

1860
04:44:09,333 --> 04:44:12,250
Rocco, what's this?

1861
04:44:12,375 --> 04:44:15,083
It's an orange from Miami.

1862
04:44:15,208 --> 04:44:18,000
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.

1863
04:44:20,542 --> 04:44:23,417
- Good to see you.
- Tom isn't gonna sit in with us.

1864
04:44:23,500 --> 04:44:26,125
He only handles specific areas
of the family business.

1865
04:44:26,250 --> 04:44:28,166
- Tom?
- Sure, Mike.

1866
04:44:33,583 --> 04:44:35,417
What are you drinking, Johnny?

1867
04:44:35,542 --> 04:44:36,917
Anisette.

1868
04:44:42,083 --> 04:44:44,417
If you need anything
I'll be outside, all right?

1869
04:44:44,500 --> 04:44:46,417
Just tell Rocco we're waiting.

1870
04:44:52,458 --> 04:44:55,000
I just left Mr. Roth in Miami.

1871
04:44:55,125 --> 04:44:57,792
- How's his health?
- It's not good.

1872
04:44:59,834 --> 04:45:02,458
Is there anything I can do,
anything I can send?

1873
04:45:02,583 --> 04:45:06,041
He appreciates your concern,
Michael, and your respect.

1874
04:45:07,667 --> 04:45:10,750
That casino you're interested in,
the registered owners are...

1875
04:45:10,875 --> 04:45:14,875
Jacob Lawrence, Allan Barclay,
both Beverly Hills attorneys.

1876
04:45:15,000 --> 04:45:17,917
The real owners are the Lakeville
Road group from Cleveland...

1877
04:45:18,041 --> 04:45:20,458
and our friend in Miami.

1878
04:45:20,583 --> 04:45:22,125
Meyer Klingman runs the store.

1879
04:45:22,250 --> 04:45:24,917
He owns a piece of it too,
and he does all right.

1880
04:45:25,000 --> 04:45:27,792
But I've been instructed to tell you
that if you move Klingman out...

1881
04:45:27,917 --> 04:45:30,291
our friend in Miami will go along.

1882
04:45:33,166 --> 04:45:35,166
That's very kind of him.

1883
04:45:35,291 --> 04:45:37,500
You tell him
that's greatly appreciated.

1884
04:45:38,875 --> 04:45:41,875
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

1885
04:45:44,500 --> 04:45:48,208
One by one,
our old friends are gone.

1886
04:45:48,333 --> 04:45:51,667
Death, natural or not...

1887
04:45:51,750 --> 04:45:53,917
prison, deported.

1888
04:45:55,875 --> 04:45:58,250
Hyman Roth is the only one left...

1889
04:45:58,333 --> 04:46:01,583
because he always made money
for his partners.

1890
04:46:29,625 --> 04:46:31,291
Anthony. No!

1891
04:46:31,583 --> 04:46:32,542
Anthony, No, No.

1892
04:46:32,542 --> 04:46:34,709
I don't want you
going near that house.

1893
04:46:38,417 --> 04:46:42,375
(announcer) ...Red Cadillac, Nevada Licence plate number

1894
04:46:42,375 --> 04:46:43,291
Anthony!

1895
04:46:43,291 --> 04:46:50,208
(announcer) ...240792,
Please move the car in the
parking lot.

1896
04:46:55,583 --> 04:46:58,792
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Frankie, wake up.

1897
04:46:58,875 --> 04:47:02,125
A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.

1898
04:47:02,208 --> 04:47:06,625
Would you please welcome Senator
Pat Geary of the state of Nevada.

1899
04:47:06,750 --> 04:47:08,625
And there's Mrs. Geary.

1900
04:47:19,792 --> 04:47:21,667
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1901
04:47:21,792 --> 04:47:25,625
And this is a very,
very happy day for me...

1902
04:47:25,709 --> 04:47:28,166
and my wife, Mrs. Geary.

1903
04:47:29,417 --> 04:47:32,542
We see Nevada far too seldom...

1904
04:47:32,667 --> 04:47:34,750
but particularly today...

1905
04:47:34,875 --> 04:47:37,542
when we can join with old friends,
we can make new friends...

1906
04:47:37,667 --> 04:47:41,333
and we help celebrate
a young man's first communion...

1907
04:47:42,250 --> 04:47:45,291
and also to thank
that boy's family...

1908
04:47:45,417 --> 04:47:48,500
for a magnificent contribution
to the state.

1909
04:47:49,375 --> 04:47:52,709
I have here in my hand a check...

1910
04:47:52,792 --> 04:47:55,041
made out to the university...

1911
04:47:55,166 --> 04:47:57,917
and it is
a magnificent endowment...

1912
04:47:58,000 --> 04:47:59,917
in the name of...

1913
04:48:01,500 --> 04:48:04,208
Anthony Vito Corleone.

1914
04:48:05,375 --> 04:48:08,583
And the check is signed
by that young man's parents...

1915
04:48:08,709 --> 04:48:11,291
whom I think
we should recognize now.

1916
04:48:11,417 --> 04:48:12,875
Mike, Pat, Kay--

1917
04:48:13,000 --> 04:48:15,917
Stand up, please.
Let the folks see you.

1918
04:48:16,000 --> 04:48:18,041
Folks, I want you to join with me...

1919
04:48:18,166 --> 04:48:21,041
in giving a real
Nevada thank-you...

1920
04:48:21,125 --> 04:48:23,875
to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!

1921
04:48:29,917 --> 04:48:32,959
We also have,
as a special added attraction...

1922
04:48:33,041 --> 04:48:35,125
the Sierra Boys Choir...

1923
04:48:35,250 --> 04:48:37,709
who have chosen...

1924
04:48:37,834 --> 04:48:41,667
a certain special song
and a special arrangement...

1925
04:48:41,750 --> 04:48:45,667
to honor their host,
Mr. Michael Corleone.

1926
04:48:45,750 --> 04:48:47,875
Boys.

1927
04:48:54,625 --> 04:48:59,041
- Why this feeling
- Why this feeling

1928
04:48:59,125 --> 04:49:03,542
- Why this glow
-Just why this glow

1929
04:49:03,667 --> 04:49:06,041
The plaque.

1930
04:49:06,166 --> 04:49:08,041
Okay, fellas, I got that one.

1931
04:49:09,917 --> 04:49:12,667
Okay, this is yours.

1932
04:49:12,750 --> 04:49:14,667
Senator, just you and Mrs. Corleone.

1933
04:49:36,750 --> 04:49:38,500
- Excuse me.
- This is my lawyer Tom Hagen.

1934
04:49:38,625 --> 04:49:40,500
- Senator Geary.
- Mr. Hagen.

1935
04:49:40,625 --> 04:49:43,667
He's the one who arranged this whole
thing through your man Turnbull.

1936
04:49:43,792 --> 04:49:46,000
- Yes, yes.
- Sit down.

1937
04:49:50,041 --> 04:49:53,458
I was under the impression
that you and I would talk alone.

1938
04:49:54,959 --> 04:49:58,083
I trust these men
with my life, Senator.

1939
04:49:58,208 --> 04:50:00,291
If I were to ask them to leave,
it would be an insult.

1940
04:50:02,500 --> 04:50:05,834
It's all right with me, but I should
tell you I am a blunt man...

1941
04:50:05,959 --> 04:50:08,792
and I intend to speak
very frankly to you...

1942
04:50:08,875 --> 04:50:14,417
more frankly than anyone in my
position's talked to you before.

1943
04:50:14,500 --> 04:50:17,166
The Corleone family has done
very well here in Nevada.

1944
04:50:17,291 --> 04:50:22,667
You own, or you control,
two major hotels in Vegas...

1945
04:50:22,750 --> 04:50:25,125
one in Reno.

1946
04:50:25,250 --> 04:50:27,375
The licenses
were grandfathered in...

1947
04:50:27,458 --> 04:50:30,667
so there was no problem
with the gaming commission.

1948
04:50:32,917 --> 04:50:35,834
But now my sources tell me that...

1949
04:50:35,959 --> 04:50:39,458
you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

1950
04:50:39,583 --> 04:50:41,959
They tell me that within a week...

1951
04:50:42,041 --> 04:50:44,542
you're gonna move Klingman out.

1952
04:50:44,667 --> 04:50:46,792
That's quite an expansion.

1953
04:50:46,917 --> 04:50:50,583
However, it will leave you
with one little technical problem.

1954
04:50:53,667 --> 04:50:56,083
The license will still be
in Klingman's name.

1955
04:50:57,709 --> 04:50:59,083
Turnbull is a good man.

1956
04:50:59,208 --> 04:51:02,166
Yeah, well, let's just--
Let's cut out the bullshit.

1957
04:51:02,250 --> 04:51:05,417
I don't want to spend any more time
here than I have to.

1958
04:51:05,542 --> 04:51:08,000
You can have the license.

1959
04:51:08,125 --> 04:51:10,333
The price is $250,000...

1960
04:51:10,458 --> 04:51:13,417
plus a monthly payment
of five percent of the gross...

1961
04:51:13,500 --> 04:51:15,208
of all four hotels...

1962
04:51:15,333 --> 04:51:18,083
Mr. Corleone.

1963
04:51:22,000 --> 04:51:25,792
Now, the price for the license
is less than $20,000.

1964
04:51:25,875 --> 04:51:27,792
- Am I right?
- That's right.

1965
04:51:29,333 --> 04:51:31,625
Now, why would I ever consider
paying more than that?

1966
04:51:31,750 --> 04:51:34,917
Because I intend to squeeze you.

1967
04:51:35,041 --> 04:51:37,625
I don't like your kind of people.

1968
04:51:37,750 --> 04:51:39,917
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country...

1969
04:51:40,041 --> 04:51:41,875
in your oily hair...

1970
04:51:43,291 --> 04:51:45,625
dressed up in those silk suits...

1971
04:51:45,750 --> 04:51:49,709
and you try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

1972
04:51:49,834 --> 04:51:52,709
I'll do business with you,
but the fact is that...

1973
04:51:52,834 --> 04:51:55,625
I despise your masquerade...

1974
04:51:55,709 --> 04:51:58,667
the dishonest way
you pose yourself--

1975
04:51:58,750 --> 04:52:00,959
yourself and your whole
fucking family.

1976
04:52:08,792 --> 04:52:11,542
Senator...

1977
04:52:11,625 --> 04:52:13,917
we're both part
of the same hypocrisy...

1978
04:52:16,250 --> 04:52:19,417
but never think it applies
to my family.

1979
04:52:19,500 --> 04:52:22,125
All right, all right.

1980
04:52:23,583 --> 04:52:26,667
Some people have to play
little games.

1981
04:52:26,792 --> 04:52:28,333
You play yours.

1982
04:52:31,041 --> 04:52:34,667
Let's just say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest to.

1983
04:52:35,625 --> 04:52:38,709
But I want your answer
and the money by noon tomorrow.

1984
04:52:38,834 --> 04:52:43,083
And one more thing:
Don't you contact me again, ever.

1985
04:52:43,208 --> 04:52:47,166
From now on, you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

1986
04:52:48,166 --> 04:52:51,625
Senator, you can have
my answer now if you like.

1987
04:52:54,709 --> 04:52:57,500
My offer is this:

1988
04:52:57,625 --> 04:52:59,000
nothing.

1989
04:53:00,750 --> 04:53:02,667
Not even the fee
for the gaming license...

1990
04:53:02,750 --> 04:53:06,291
which I would appreciate
if you would put up personally.

1991
04:53:11,875 --> 04:53:13,417
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1992
04:53:16,875 --> 04:53:19,417
Ladies. I didn't know
you were out here.

1993
04:53:19,542 --> 04:53:22,667
- We have to go. We're late.
- Really? I'm sorry.

1994
04:53:22,792 --> 04:53:25,375
It's been a delightful party.
Thank you for inviting us.

1995
04:53:25,458 --> 04:53:28,834
It's been our pleasure.
It was wonderful talking to you.

1996
04:54:00,125 --> 04:54:02,375
What's cent'anni?

1997
04:54:02,500 --> 04:54:04,458
Cent'anni.
It means a hundred years.

1998
04:54:05,583 --> 04:54:09,667
It means we should all live happily
for a hundred years, the family.

1999
04:54:09,792 --> 04:54:11,625
It'd be true
if my father were alive.

2000
04:54:15,625 --> 04:54:18,333
Merle, you've met
my sister-in-law Deanna.

2001
04:54:19,417 --> 04:54:21,041
- Fredo's wife.
- A pleasure, Merle.

2002
04:54:21,125 --> 04:54:23,041
- How do you do?
- My pleasure.

2003
04:54:25,375 --> 04:54:27,875
What did she mean by that?

2004
04:54:42,041 --> 04:54:46,041
Mr. Pentangeli,
you were talking
to Anthony today, right?

2005
04:54:46,041 --> 04:54:47,750
(Speaking Italian)

2006
04:54:47,750 --> 04:54:50,500
We talked in Sicilian

2007
04:54:50,500 --> 04:54:54,583
It was a one-sided
conversation.

2008
04:54:54,583 --> 04:54:56,417
I see.

2009
04:55:00,166 --> 04:55:02,291
He's a little boy,
you know.

2010
04:55:03,125 --> 04:55:05,500
(Speaking Italian)

2011
04:55:39,250 --> 04:55:41,792
What's the matter?
I just wanna dance.

2012
04:55:41,917 --> 04:55:44,000
Dancing is one thing.
You're falling all over the floor.

2013
04:55:44,083 --> 04:55:47,792
I know what's the matter. You're
jealous 'cause he's a real man.

2014
04:55:47,917 --> 04:55:50,959
I swear to God, I'm gonna
belt you right in the teeth.

2015
04:55:51,083 --> 04:55:52,667
You couldn't belt your mama.

2016
04:55:53,834 --> 04:55:56,750
You know something? These dagos are
crazy when it comes to their wives.

2017
04:55:56,834 --> 04:55:59,792
Michael says that if
you can't take care of this...

2018
04:55:59,875 --> 04:56:02,208
I have to.

2019
04:56:02,333 --> 04:56:05,125
- I think you'd better.
- Never marry a Wop!

2020
04:56:05,208 --> 04:56:08,125
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop!

2021
04:56:09,667 --> 04:56:11,166
Stop that!

2022
04:56:11,250 --> 04:56:13,375
What are you doing to me?

2023
04:56:13,458 --> 04:56:15,875
You big slob! Help!

2024
04:56:17,583 --> 04:56:19,083
I can't control her, Mikey.

2025
04:56:19,208 --> 04:56:22,709
You're my brother, Fredo.
You don't have to apologize to me.

2026
04:56:26,542 --> 04:56:28,458
Clemenza promised
the Rosato brothers...

2027
04:56:28,542 --> 04:56:30,542
three territories in the Bronx
after he died.

2028
04:56:30,667 --> 04:56:32,625
You took over,
and you didn't give it to them.

2029
04:56:32,709 --> 04:56:33,875
- I welched?
- You welched.

2030
04:56:34,000 --> 04:56:36,959
Clemenza promised them "ugatz. "

2031
04:56:37,041 --> 04:56:38,834
Clemenza promised them nothing.

2032
04:56:38,917 --> 04:56:41,166
He hated those son ofa bitches
more than I do.

2033
04:56:41,250 --> 04:56:44,375
Frankie, they feel cheated.

2034
04:56:44,500 --> 04:56:48,041
You're sitting high up
in the Sierra Mountains...

2035
04:56:48,166 --> 04:56:49,625
and you're drinking--

2036
04:56:49,667 --> 04:56:51,417
- What's he drinking, Cicci?
- Champagne.

2037
04:56:51,500 --> 04:56:53,500
Champagne cocktails.

2038
04:56:53,625 --> 04:56:55,667
And you're passing judgment
on how I run my family.

2039
04:57:19,792 --> 04:57:22,083
You're a good old man.

2040
04:57:22,166 --> 04:57:23,750
I like you.

2041
04:57:24,583 --> 04:57:26,667
And you were loyal
to my father for years.

2042
04:57:28,625 --> 04:57:32,208
The Rosato brothers,
they're taking hostages.

2043
04:57:33,834 --> 04:57:37,125
And Mike,
they spit right in my face...

2044
04:57:37,208 --> 04:57:39,625
all because they're backed up
by that Jew in Miami.

2045
04:57:39,709 --> 04:57:42,709
I know. That's why
I don't want 'em touched.

2046
04:57:42,834 --> 04:57:43,875
- You don't want 'em touched.
- No.

2047
04:57:44,000 --> 04:57:46,542
I want you to be fair with them.

2048
04:57:46,667 --> 04:57:48,625
You want me to be fair with 'em?

2049
04:57:50,166 --> 04:57:51,834
How can you be fair to animals?

2050
04:57:51,917 --> 04:57:54,333
Tom, for Christ's sakes, listen.

2051
04:57:54,417 --> 04:57:57,959
They recruit spics.
They recruit niggers.

2052
04:57:58,083 --> 04:58:02,083
And they do violence in
their grandmothers' neighborhoods.

2053
04:58:02,166 --> 04:58:04,792
And I tell ya,
everything with them is whores.

2054
04:58:04,917 --> 04:58:08,375
Whores and junk. Dope.

2055
04:58:08,500 --> 04:58:11,125
And they leave the gambling to last.

2056
04:58:11,250 --> 04:58:14,291
Now, I wanna run my family
without you on my back...

2057
04:58:14,417 --> 04:58:17,458
and I want those
Rosato brothers dead.

2058
04:58:25,041 --> 04:58:28,208
Now, I have business that's
important with Hyman Roth.

2059
04:58:28,333 --> 04:58:29,625
I don't want it disturbed.

2060
04:58:31,792 --> 04:58:33,834
Then you'll give your loyalty
to a Jew before your own blood?

2061
04:58:38,208 --> 04:58:41,291
Come on. You know my father
did business with Hyman Roth.

2062
04:58:41,417 --> 04:58:42,917
He respected him.

2063
04:58:43,000 --> 04:58:45,750
Your father did business
with Hyman Roth...

2064
04:58:45,834 --> 04:58:48,250
your father respected Hyman Roth...

2065
04:58:48,375 --> 04:58:50,792
but your father
never trusted Hyman Roth...

2066
04:58:50,875 --> 04:58:54,709
or his Sicilian messenger boy
Johnny Ola.

2067
04:59:02,583 --> 04:59:04,959
And I want everybody here to know...

2068
04:59:05,083 --> 04:59:08,083
there's not gonna be
no trouble from me.

2069
04:59:08,208 --> 04:59:10,125
Don Corleone.

2070
04:59:20,500 --> 04:59:22,417
You want him to leave now?

2071
04:59:25,166 --> 04:59:28,542
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

2072
04:59:30,583 --> 04:59:32,500
The old man had too much wine.

2073
04:59:37,709 --> 04:59:39,834
It's late.

2074
04:59:40,709 --> 04:59:43,417
(Speaking Italian)

2075
04:59:52,166 --> 04:59:53,792
Ahhh![

2076
04:59:54,333 --> 04:59:56,041
(Speaks Italian)

2077
05:00:16,375 --> 05:00:19,417
I give you $1,000.
I don't wanna
embarrass your father.

2078
05:00:19,417 --> 05:00:21,375
Put that in
your pocket.

2079
05:00:21,375 --> 05:00:22,792
You hide it
under your pillow,

2080
05:00:22,792 --> 05:00:24,667
Don't tell nobody.

2081
05:00:25,583 --> 05:00:30,667
Look, angel face,
you got a face...
(speaks Italian)

2082
05:00:30,667 --> 05:00:33,500
I got children, too.

2083
05:00:33,500 --> 05:00:35,041
I love you.

2084
05:00:35,041 --> 05:00:37,125
Let me say it.
Now go ahead.

2085
05:00:37,125 --> 05:00:38,500
(speaks Italian)

2086
05:00:50,291 --> 05:00:52,333
How's the baby?

2087
05:00:52,458 --> 05:00:55,291
Sleeping inside me.

2088
05:00:55,375 --> 05:00:59,208
- Does it feel like a boy?
- Yes, it does, Michael.

2089
05:01:04,291 --> 05:01:06,792
I'm sorry about
all the people today.

2090
05:01:06,917 --> 05:01:08,542
Bad timing.

2091
05:01:08,667 --> 05:01:11,083
It couldn't be helped, though.

2092
05:01:11,166 --> 05:01:13,792
It made me think
of what you once told me.

2093
05:01:16,458 --> 05:01:20,625
In five years, the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate.

2094
05:01:20,709 --> 05:01:22,625
That was seven years ago.

2095
05:01:26,041 --> 05:01:28,250
I know.

2096
05:01:28,375 --> 05:01:29,917
I'm trying, darling.

2097
05:02:17,750 --> 05:02:19,375
You Klingman?

2098
05:02:19,542 --> 05:02:21,250
Who's askin'?

2099
05:02:21,333 --> 05:02:22,750
Where can we talk?

2100
05:02:22,750 --> 05:02:24,417
Right here.

2101
05:02:25,625 --> 05:02:29,458
I represent the interest
in the Corleone family.

2102
05:02:29,583 --> 05:02:33,166
I'm makin' the invitation
to you to tie up your affairs.

2103
05:02:33,166 --> 05:02:35,208
Be out of the hotel
by Monday morning.

2104
05:02:35,208 --> 05:02:37,583
Who do you think
your talking to?

2105
05:02:37,583 --> 05:02:39,333
You says your name was Klingman.

2106
05:02:39,333 --> 05:02:43,041
You can't come in here
and talk to an owner
like that.

2107
05:02:43,333 --> 05:02:47,542
You miss my point.
You're no longer an owner.

2108
05:02:47,542 --> 05:02:49,583
Get outta my hotel.

2109
05:02:49,583 --> 05:02:53,208
Boys, get him out of my hotel. Get him out...

2110
05:03:07,750 --> 05:03:10,417
Somebody help me!

2111
05:03:14,417 --> 05:03:15,583
All right.
All right.

2112
05:03:15,583 --> 05:03:19,250
All right! I'll clear out.

2113
05:03:22,792 --> 05:03:25,125
OK, keep it going.

2114
05:03:25,125 --> 05:03:26,291
What's the matter? Didn't you hear me?

2115
05:03:26,291 --> 05:03:28,166
Keep it going.

2116
05:05:04,417 --> 05:05:06,208
What's the matter?

2117
05:05:06,208 --> 05:05:08,333
Can't you sleep?

2118
05:05:11,166 --> 05:05:12,500
You all right?

2119
05:05:26,083 --> 05:05:28,417
Did you like your party?

2120
05:05:29,458 --> 05:05:30,959
I got lots of presents.

2121
05:05:31,083 --> 05:05:34,834
I know.
Did you like 'em?

2122
05:05:34,959 --> 05:05:37,667
I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

2123
05:05:38,542 --> 05:05:40,959
Well, they're my friends.

2124
05:05:43,166 --> 05:05:45,250
Did you see my present for you?

2125
05:05:45,709 --> 05:05:47,125
You got me a present?

2126
05:05:47,291 --> 05:05:50,000
Downstairs on your pillow.

2127
05:05:50,875 --> 05:05:54,333
Well, I'll see it when I go to bed.

2128
05:05:57,041 --> 05:05:59,875
Anthony, I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

2129
05:06:01,166 --> 05:06:03,166
Will you take me?

2130
05:06:03,208 --> 05:06:06,583
- No, I can't, Anthony.
- Why do you have to go?

2131
05:06:08,417 --> 05:06:10,834
'Cause I have to do business.

2132
05:06:10,959 --> 05:06:12,792
I could help you.

2133
05:06:18,083 --> 05:06:20,041
Well, someday you will.

2134
05:06:21,041 --> 05:06:22,625
Get some sleep.

2135
05:06:32,083 --> 05:06:33,125
Good night.

2136
05:07:09,750 --> 05:07:11,166
Did you see this?

2137
05:07:26,667 --> 05:07:29,000
Michael, why are the drapes open?

2138
05:07:56,250 --> 05:07:58,041
- Kay, you all right?
- Yeah.

2139
05:07:58,125 --> 05:08:00,667
- Are you hit?
- No.

2140
05:08:03,083 --> 05:08:04,917
It's over. It's over.

2141
05:08:07,417 --> 05:08:09,375
Now! Shut it off!

2142
05:08:11,041 --> 05:08:12,709
Hold it!

2143
05:08:23,500 --> 05:08:27,291
They're still on the property.
Please, stay inside.

2144
05:08:27,417 --> 05:08:28,917
- Keep them alive.
- We'll try.

2145
05:08:29,041 --> 05:08:30,208
Rocco! Alive!

2146
05:08:32,291 --> 05:08:34,208
Stay by the door.

2147
05:08:39,125 --> 05:08:40,750
Check by the boathouse!

2148
05:09:53,834 --> 05:09:55,375
Yeah, come in.

2149
05:10:02,875 --> 05:10:04,625
- Mike, are you all right?
- Yeah.

2150
05:10:04,709 --> 05:10:06,125
Yeah?

2151
05:10:09,625 --> 05:10:11,959
There's a lot
I can't tell you, Tom.

2152
05:10:14,500 --> 05:10:16,709
Now, I know that's
upset you in the past.

2153
05:10:19,125 --> 05:10:22,333
You felt it was because of some
lack of trust or confidence...

2154
05:10:25,917 --> 05:10:29,250
but it's because
I admire you and I love you...

2155
05:10:29,333 --> 05:10:31,291
that I kept things
secret from you.

2156
05:10:34,000 --> 05:10:36,500
That's why at this moment you're
the only one I can completely trust.

2157
05:10:39,709 --> 05:10:41,166
Fredo?

2158
05:10:41,250 --> 05:10:44,208
Well, he's got a good heart...

2159
05:10:44,333 --> 05:10:46,333
but he's weak and he's stupid...

2160
05:10:46,417 --> 05:10:48,333
and this is life and death.

2161
05:10:49,500 --> 05:10:52,917
Tom, you're my brother.

2162
05:10:58,834 --> 05:11:01,834
I always wanted to be thought of
as a brother by you.

2163
05:11:01,959 --> 05:11:03,458
A real brother.

2164
05:11:06,500 --> 05:11:08,041
I know that.

2165
05:11:14,667 --> 05:11:17,208
You're gonna take over.

2166
05:11:17,333 --> 05:11:19,709
You're gonna be the don.

2167
05:11:22,959 --> 05:11:26,166
If what I think has happened
has happened...

2168
05:11:26,291 --> 05:11:28,041
I'm gonna leave here tonight.

2169
05:11:29,291 --> 05:11:32,792
I give you complete power
over Fredo and his men--

2170
05:11:32,917 --> 05:11:35,000
Rocco, Neri, everyone.

2171
05:11:37,125 --> 05:11:42,375
I'm trusting you with the lives
of my wife and my children--

2172
05:11:42,500 --> 05:11:44,041
the future of this family.

2173
05:11:47,375 --> 05:11:48,583
When we catch these guys...

2174
05:11:48,709 --> 05:11:50,500
do you think we'll be able to
find out who's back of all this?

2175
05:11:50,583 --> 05:11:52,792
We're not gonna catch 'em.

2176
05:11:54,250 --> 05:11:56,583
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

2177
05:11:59,125 --> 05:12:02,375
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

2178
05:12:02,500 --> 05:12:04,041
Inside.

2179
05:12:04,166 --> 05:12:06,792
Very, very frightened
they botched it.

2180
05:12:06,875 --> 05:12:09,166
Yeah, but your people,
Rocco and Neri...

2181
05:12:09,291 --> 05:12:11,458
you don't think that they had
something to do with this?

2182
05:12:15,375 --> 05:12:19,375
See, all our people
are businessmen.

2183
05:12:21,291 --> 05:12:22,792
Their loyalty's based on that.

2184
05:12:26,542 --> 05:12:28,417
One thing I learned from Pop...

2185
05:12:30,500 --> 05:12:33,667
was to try to think
as people around you think.

2186
05:12:36,125 --> 05:12:39,125
Now, on that basis,
anything's possible.

2187
05:12:41,000 --> 05:12:44,792
I seen them!
Right out my window!

2188
05:12:44,875 --> 05:12:47,583
I wanna get out of here!
They're lying there dead!

2189
05:12:47,709 --> 05:12:49,000
Get her inside!

2190
05:12:59,208 --> 05:13:02,166
Over here.
There's two of'em.

2191
05:13:02,291 --> 05:13:04,083
Looks like they were
hired out of New York.

2192
05:13:04,166 --> 05:13:06,458
I don't recognize 'em.

2193
05:13:06,542 --> 05:13:09,792
We won't get anything
out of them now.

2194
05:13:09,875 --> 05:13:11,458
Fish 'em out.

2195
05:13:36,000 --> 05:13:38,875
All right, get rid of the bodies.

2196
05:13:38,959 --> 05:13:40,959
- Where's Mike?
- Rocco.

2197
05:16:10,375 --> 05:16:12,291
Come on in.

2198
05:16:14,125 --> 05:16:17,041
It's all right. Come on.
Hyman's in there.

2199
05:16:17,166 --> 05:16:20,125
I was just making some lunch.
Would you like a tuna sandwich?

2200
05:16:20,208 --> 05:16:22,125
Uh, no, thankyou.

2201
05:16:27,709 --> 05:16:30,500
Pickup of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...

2202
05:16:30,625 --> 05:16:33,000
and the ball is at
the Trojan 38-yardline.

2203
05:16:33,083 --> 05:16:34,333
Mr. Roth?

2204
05:16:34,417 --> 05:16:36,333
Come in, Michael.

2205
05:16:38,875 --> 05:16:41,291
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

2206
05:16:43,208 --> 05:16:45,250
It's almost over.

2207
05:16:47,625 --> 05:16:49,208
You follow the football game?

2208
05:16:49,333 --> 05:16:52,625
- Pickup offive.
- Not for a while I haven't.

2209
05:16:52,750 --> 05:16:55,625
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

2210
05:16:55,709 --> 05:16:58,667
One of the things I love
about this country.

2211
05:16:58,750 --> 05:17:00,792
Baseball too.

2212
05:17:00,917 --> 05:17:02,834
I've loved baseball...

2213
05:17:02,917 --> 05:17:06,959
ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.

2214
05:17:07,083 --> 05:17:10,417
...47. Marked down there,
say the officials.

2215
05:17:10,542 --> 05:17:13,166
And at that point
it'll be first and ten--

2216
05:17:13,291 --> 05:17:14,792
I heard you had some trouble.

2217
05:17:14,917 --> 05:17:17,875
It'll be third and ten, another
of those big plays now...

2218
05:17:17,917 --> 05:17:20,625
- Stupid.
- coming up for S.C.

2219
05:17:20,750 --> 05:17:23,000
People behaving like that
with guns.

2220
05:17:23,125 --> 05:17:25,625
...but it looks like
it could stall here.

2221
05:17:25,792 --> 05:17:28,542
The important thing is,
you're all right.

2222
05:17:28,667 --> 05:17:32,625
Good health.
The most important thing.

2223
05:17:32,709 --> 05:17:35,208
More than success.
More than money.

2224
05:17:35,333 --> 05:17:38,125
- Now he's back to pass.
- More than power.

2225
05:17:38,208 --> 05:17:40,291
Rolls up field for Hayes.
He's intercepted.

2226
05:17:40,417 --> 05:17:46,083
Hurd has it to the lrish 40.
To the far sideline. Gets by the 45.

2227
05:17:46,208 --> 05:17:50,583
He's hit and dropped
at the S.C. 42-yardline.

2228
05:17:50,667 --> 05:17:53,250
Notre Dame's first bigbreak
of the game.

2229
05:17:53,417 --> 05:17:57,166
I came here because there's
gonna be more bloodshed.

2230
05:17:57,291 --> 05:17:59,667
I want you to know about it
before it happens...

2231
05:17:59,750 --> 05:18:02,208
so that there's no danger
of starting another war.

2232
05:18:02,333 --> 05:18:05,291
Nobody wants another war.

2233
05:18:05,458 --> 05:18:09,125
Frank Pentangeli came to my home
and he asked my permission...

2234
05:18:09,166 --> 05:18:10,709
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

2235
05:18:10,834 --> 05:18:13,166
When I refused,
he tried to have me killed.

2236
05:18:13,291 --> 05:18:16,792
He was stupid. I was lucky.
I'll visit him soon.

2237
05:18:16,917 --> 05:18:20,208
The important thing is that
nothing interfere...

2238
05:18:20,291 --> 05:18:22,166
with our plans for the future.

2239
05:18:22,291 --> 05:18:26,000
- Yours and mine.
- Nothing is more important.

2240
05:18:26,125 --> 05:18:27,583
Good.

2241
05:18:27,709 --> 05:18:30,625
You're a wise
and considerate young man.

2242
05:18:30,709 --> 05:18:33,583
And you're a great man,
Mr. Roth.

2243
05:18:33,709 --> 05:18:37,709
- There's much I can learn from you.
- What can I do to help, Michael?

2244
05:18:37,834 --> 05:18:40,625
To the 32, and is downed there
by Danny Zika.

2245
05:18:40,709 --> 05:18:43,208
- Excuse me. Lunch.
- Oh.

2246
05:18:43,333 --> 05:18:45,208
- Okay.
- Ohh!

2247
05:18:45,333 --> 05:18:48,208
Hyman, you're gonna
break my ear drums.

2248
05:18:49,458 --> 05:18:51,583
- Okay, enjoy it.
- Thanks.

2249
05:18:57,709 --> 05:19:01,458
You're young.
I'm old and sick.

2250
05:19:01,583 --> 05:19:04,417
What we'll do together
in the next few months...

2251
05:19:04,500 --> 05:19:06,583
will make history, Michael.

2252
05:19:06,709 --> 05:19:09,625
History.
It's never been done before.

2253
05:19:09,750 --> 05:19:14,041
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

2254
05:19:16,250 --> 05:19:19,041
And Pentangeli is a dead man.

2255
05:19:19,166 --> 05:19:22,208
- You don't object?
- Pickup of four.

2256
05:19:22,333 --> 05:19:24,250
He's small potatoes.

2257
05:19:35,000 --> 05:19:37,542
What's up?

2258
05:19:39,709 --> 05:19:41,583
We got company, huh?

2259
05:20:21,625 --> 05:20:24,709
Don Corleone, I wish you would've
let me know you were comin'.

2260
05:20:24,834 --> 05:20:27,333
I could've prepared
something for you.

2261
05:20:27,458 --> 05:20:30,375
I didn't want you to know
I was coming.

2262
05:20:36,709 --> 05:20:38,417
You heard what happened
in my home?

2263
05:20:38,500 --> 05:20:42,458
- Mike, I almost died myself.
- In my home!

2264
05:20:45,875 --> 05:20:48,792
In my bedroom
where my wife sleeps!

2265
05:20:51,750 --> 05:20:55,583
Where my children come
and play with their toys.

2266
05:20:55,667 --> 05:20:57,583
In my home.

2267
05:21:14,709 --> 05:21:17,750
I want you to help me
take my revenge.

2268
05:21:17,875 --> 05:21:19,875
Michael, anything.

2269
05:21:20,000 --> 05:21:21,875
What can I do?

2270
05:21:24,542 --> 05:21:27,917
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

2271
05:21:28,000 --> 05:21:30,667
Mike, I don't understand.
I don't--

2272
05:21:30,750 --> 05:21:33,458
I don't have your brain
for big deals...

2273
05:21:33,625 --> 05:21:35,333
but this is a street thing.

2274
05:21:35,458 --> 05:21:38,583
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
That--

2275
05:21:38,667 --> 05:21:40,750
He's backin' up
those son-of-a-bitches.

2276
05:21:40,875 --> 05:21:41,792
I know.

2277
05:21:41,917 --> 05:21:45,291
Then why? Why do you ask me
to lay down to him, Mike?

2278
05:21:51,375 --> 05:21:54,709
It was Hyman Roth that
tried to have me killed.

2279
05:21:56,583 --> 05:21:59,709
I know it was him.

2280
05:21:59,792 --> 05:22:02,166
Jesus Christ, Mike.

2281
05:22:02,208 --> 05:22:04,166
Jesus Christ, look,
let's get 'em all.

2282
05:22:04,250 --> 05:22:07,542
Let's hit 'em all now,
while we got the muscle.

2283
05:22:12,250 --> 05:22:14,625
This used to be
my father's old study.

2284
05:22:16,208 --> 05:22:18,166
It's changed.

2285
05:22:19,500 --> 05:22:22,000
I remember
there used to be a--

2286
05:22:22,083 --> 05:22:24,000
A big desk was here.

2287
05:22:27,000 --> 05:22:28,875
I remember when I was a kid,
Frankie...

2288
05:22:29,000 --> 05:22:31,417
we had to be very quiet
when we played near here.

2289
05:22:39,625 --> 05:22:43,000
I was very happy that this
house never went to strangers.

2290
05:22:44,709 --> 05:22:47,875
First Clemenza took it over.
Now you.

2291
05:22:50,417 --> 05:22:53,125
My father taught me
many things here.

2292
05:22:53,208 --> 05:22:55,625
He taught me in this room.

2293
05:22:58,875 --> 05:23:02,500
He taught me,
keep your friends close...

2294
05:23:02,625 --> 05:23:04,917
but your enemies closer.

2295
05:23:05,041 --> 05:23:08,417
Now, if Hyman Roth sees that
I interceded in this thing...

2296
05:23:08,542 --> 05:23:11,417
in the Rosato brothers' favor...

2297
05:23:11,458 --> 05:23:14,291
he's gonna think his relationship
with me is still good.

2298
05:23:17,792 --> 05:23:20,875
That's what I want him to think.

2299
05:23:21,000 --> 05:23:25,625
I want him completely relaxed
and confident in our friendship.

2300
05:23:25,750 --> 05:23:29,709
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

2301
05:23:57,333 --> 05:24:01,458
- Yeah?
- Fredo. This is Johnny.

2302
05:24:01,500 --> 05:24:03,917
Johnny Ola.
We need some more help.

2303
05:24:04,041 --> 05:24:06,208
Johnny?

2304
05:24:06,333 --> 05:24:09,208
Jesus Christ,
what the hell time is it?

2305
05:24:09,333 --> 05:24:12,291
- Who is that, honey?
- Listen good, Fredo.

2306
05:24:12,417 --> 05:24:15,417
What are you callin' me here for?
I don't want to talk to you.

2307
05:24:15,500 --> 05:24:17,750
Pentangeli's set up a meeting
with the Rosato brothers.

2308
05:24:17,875 --> 05:24:20,166
- He's gonna go for their deal.
- Oh, God.

2309
05:24:20,291 --> 05:24:22,834
- Will he come alone?
- I don't know anything.

2310
05:24:22,959 --> 05:24:25,458
- You got me in deep enough already.
- Just go along.

2311
05:24:25,583 --> 05:24:27,583
Everything will be allright,
Fredo.

2312
05:24:27,709 --> 05:24:30,000
Pentangeli says he's
willing to make a deal.

2313
05:24:30,125 --> 05:24:33,000
All we wanna know is
if he's on the level.

2314
05:24:34,583 --> 05:24:37,625
You guys lied to me. I don't
want you to call me anymore.

2315
05:24:37,750 --> 05:24:40,208
Your brother's not gonna
find out we talked.

2316
05:24:40,333 --> 05:24:43,208
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

2317
05:24:53,208 --> 05:24:55,125
Who was that?

2318
05:24:55,166 --> 05:24:57,125
Uh, wrong number.

2319
05:25:04,291 --> 05:25:07,166
Frank, I got nobody here.

2320
05:25:07,333 --> 05:25:09,208
- Wait in the car, Cheech.
- Frankie--

2321
05:25:09,333 --> 05:25:11,208
It's okay, Cheech.

2322
05:25:18,375 --> 05:25:21,709
- What's this, Rosato?
- A lucky "C" note for our new deal.

2323
05:25:25,166 --> 05:25:27,625
Richie.
Give us a taste, huh?

2324
05:25:32,291 --> 05:25:36,208
Yeah, we're all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

2325
05:25:36,333 --> 05:25:40,792
- You're not gonna regret it.
- I don't like this "C" note.

2326
05:25:40,875 --> 05:25:43,291
I take that as an insult.

2327
05:25:43,417 --> 05:25:45,625
Michael Corleone says hello.

2328
05:26:02,792 --> 05:26:05,875
Get him in!
Close the fuckin' door!

2329
05:26:05,959 --> 05:26:08,333
Your friend the cop.
What the--

2330
05:26:08,458 --> 05:26:11,208
Hey, Rich, it's dark in here.

2331
05:26:11,333 --> 05:26:15,709
- Are you open or closed?
- I just come in to clean up.

2332
05:26:19,083 --> 05:26:21,417
What's the matter?

2333
05:26:21,500 --> 05:26:24,500
- Is that somethin' on the floor?
- Carmine, no, no. Not here!

2334
05:26:24,583 --> 05:26:27,083
- Not here!
- Not here, Carmine! Not a cop!

2335
05:26:27,166 --> 05:26:29,041
What?

2336
05:26:29,166 --> 05:26:32,625
You open your fuckin' mouth,
I'll blow your head off!

2337
05:27:18,625 --> 05:27:20,500
Freddie. Good to see ya.

2338
05:27:23,417 --> 05:27:25,333
Where is he?

2339
05:27:25,417 --> 05:27:28,083
He's okay. He's in the back.

2340
05:27:32,083 --> 05:27:34,458
Come on, girls.
Take a hike, huh?

2341
05:27:37,583 --> 05:27:39,458
In this room here.

2342
05:27:42,333 --> 05:27:45,417
- I wanna talk to him alone first.
- Come on, huh?

2343
05:27:54,625 --> 05:27:57,542
I thought I could
help you, Senator.

2344
05:28:01,375 --> 05:28:03,709
Hagen?

2345
05:28:04,500 --> 05:28:07,583
- Listen, Hagen, I did not--
- No.

2346
05:28:07,709 --> 05:28:09,709
- It's all right.
- I didn't do anything.

2347
05:28:09,834 --> 05:28:12,000
It's okay.

2348
05:28:12,125 --> 05:28:14,333
You're very lucky.

2349
05:28:14,417 --> 05:28:16,917
My brother Fredo
operates this place.

2350
05:28:17,000 --> 05:28:19,834
He was called before anyone.

2351
05:28:19,959 --> 05:28:21,625
Now, if this had happened
someplace else...

2352
05:28:21,750 --> 05:28:22,792
we couldn't
have helped you.

2353
05:28:26,875 --> 05:28:31,333
When I woke up
I was on the floor...

2354
05:28:31,417 --> 05:28:33,375
and I don't know
how it happened.

2355
05:28:33,458 --> 05:28:35,333
You can't remember?

2356
05:28:39,041 --> 05:28:41,125
I passed out.

2357
05:28:47,041 --> 05:28:48,917
I'll fix it.

2358
05:28:49,041 --> 05:28:51,000
Okay.

2359
05:28:57,125 --> 05:28:59,333
It was just a game.

2360
05:28:59,500 --> 05:29:00,875
Jesus.

2361
05:29:03,667 --> 05:29:05,500
Oh.

2362
05:29:11,000 --> 05:29:13,166
Jesus! Jesus!

2363
05:29:17,583 --> 05:29:20,333
Jesus God.

2364
05:29:20,458 --> 05:29:22,333
Oh, God.

2365
05:29:24,709 --> 05:29:28,417
I don't know and I don't
understand why I can't remember.

2366
05:29:28,500 --> 05:29:31,291
You don't have to remember.
Just do as I say.

2367
05:29:31,417 --> 05:29:34,041
They're putting a call in
to your office.

2368
05:29:34,166 --> 05:29:38,041
Explain that you'll be there
tomorrow afternoon.

2369
05:29:38,208 --> 05:29:40,291
You decided to spend the night...

2370
05:29:40,417 --> 05:29:44,291
at Michael Corleone's house
in Tahoe as his guest.

2371
05:29:45,041 --> 05:29:47,917
I do remember
that she was laughing.

2372
05:29:49,917 --> 05:29:51,750
We'd done it before...

2373
05:29:51,917 --> 05:29:55,208
and I know that I could
not have hurt that girl.

2374
05:29:56,333 --> 05:29:58,291
This girl has no family.

2375
05:29:58,375 --> 05:30:00,333
Nobody knows
that she worked here.

2376
05:30:00,458 --> 05:30:02,959
It'll be as though
she never existed.

2377
05:30:05,625 --> 05:30:08,041
All that's left
is our friendship.

2378
05:30:23,709 --> 05:30:25,667
- Yes?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.

2379
05:30:25,792 --> 05:30:29,750
- We're not to let you through.
- I'm just going to the market.

2380
05:30:29,792 --> 05:30:32,417
Well, if you'll just give us a list,
we'll pick up anything you want.

2381
05:30:32,500 --> 05:30:35,750
- Whose orders are these?
- Mr. Hagen's, ma'am. He's coming.

2382
05:30:35,792 --> 05:30:38,917
All right, well, I'm just gonna
have to speak to Mr. Hagen.

2383
05:30:44,291 --> 05:30:47,917
I wanted to explain this, but
I had business in Carson City.

2384
05:30:48,000 --> 05:30:50,041
Now, this is Michael's
request for your safety.

2385
05:30:50,166 --> 05:30:52,750
- We can send out for anything.
- I see.

2386
05:30:52,875 --> 05:30:54,834
I'm supposed to stay
in my house.

2387
05:30:54,917 --> 05:30:57,417
No, within the compound
would be fine.

2388
05:30:57,500 --> 05:30:59,792
I was going to take the children
to New England next week.

2389
05:30:59,917 --> 05:31:03,125
- That's off now.
- Am I a prisoner? ls that it?

2390
05:31:03,250 --> 05:31:05,709
- That's not the way we look at it.
- All right, come on, kids.

2391
05:31:05,750 --> 05:31:07,709
We're going back to the house.

2392
05:31:10,041 --> 05:31:12,000
Joe.

2393
05:31:57,750 --> 05:31:59,500
Cuba! Cuba!

2394
05:32:40,583 --> 05:32:43,583
Most respected gentlemen...

2395
05:32:43,625 --> 05:32:45,792
allow me to welcome you
to the city of Havana.

2396
05:32:48,000 --> 05:32:52,917
I want to thank this distinguished
group of American industrialists...

2397
05:32:55,000 --> 05:32:56,917
for continuing to work
with Cuba...

2398
05:32:58,709 --> 05:33:00,875
toward the greatest period
of prosperity...

2399
05:33:02,500 --> 05:33:04,417
in her entire history.

2400
05:33:05,917 --> 05:33:09,917
Mr. William Shaw, representing
the General Fruit Company;

2401
05:33:11,792 --> 05:33:13,709
Misters Corngold and Dant...

2402
05:33:13,792 --> 05:33:16,625
of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company;

2403
05:33:18,875 --> 05:33:21,125
Mr. Petty,
regional vice president...

2404
05:33:21,250 --> 05:33:23,625
of the Pan American
Mining Corporation;

2405
05:33:26,333 --> 05:33:28,500
Mr. Robert Allen
of South American Sugar;,

2406
05:33:30,875 --> 05:33:33,000
Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada...

2407
05:33:34,875 --> 05:33:38,208
representing our associates in
tourism and leisure activities;

2408
05:33:39,750 --> 05:33:42,625
and my old friend and associate
from Florida...

2409
05:33:44,750 --> 05:33:46,917
Mr. Hyman Roth.

2410
05:33:47,041 --> 05:33:48,792
I would like to take this
opportunity...

2411
05:33:48,917 --> 05:33:50,750
to thank United
Telephone and Telegraph...

2412
05:33:50,834 --> 05:33:52,792
for their lovely Christmas gift:

2413
05:33:57,417 --> 05:33:59,333
a solid gold telephone.

2414
05:34:02,000 --> 05:34:04,959
Perhaps you gentlemen would
like to take a look at it.

2415
05:34:06,458 --> 05:34:08,166
- Mr. President.
- Yes?

2416
05:34:08,291 --> 05:34:11,291
Perhaps you would discuss
the status of rebel activity...

2417
05:34:11,417 --> 05:34:14,208
and what this can mean
to our businesses.

2418
05:34:14,291 --> 05:34:15,709
- Of course.
- Very lovely.

2419
05:34:15,875 --> 05:34:18,333
I want to assure you
that although the rebels...

2420
05:34:18,458 --> 05:34:21,625
have mounted an impressive
campaign in Las Villas...

2421
05:34:27,875 --> 05:34:30,166
my staff indicates
with assurance...

2422
05:34:30,291 --> 05:34:35,166
we'll drive them out of the city
of Santa Clara before the new year.

2423
05:34:37,750 --> 05:34:40,333
And I want to put you all
at ease.

2424
05:34:40,458 --> 05:34:44,333
We will tolerate no guerillas
in the casinos or swimming pools.

2425
05:35:03,208 --> 05:35:05,166
He say that they are
making arrest...

2426
05:35:05,208 --> 05:35:08,166
and in a few minutes
he'll let us through.

2427
05:35:08,709 --> 05:35:10,750
Johnny.

2428
05:35:33,291 --> 05:35:36,417
Well, I hope my age
is correct.

2429
05:35:36,458 --> 05:35:39,625
I'm always accurate
about my age.

2430
05:35:39,709 --> 05:35:43,291
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

2431
05:35:47,125 --> 05:35:49,792
I'm very pleased...

2432
05:35:49,917 --> 05:35:52,834
you were all able to come
from such distances...

2433
05:35:52,917 --> 05:35:54,125
to be with me today.

2434
05:35:56,083 --> 05:35:58,750
When a man comes
to this point in his life...

2435
05:36:00,291 --> 05:36:03,709
he wants to turn over the
things he's been blessed with--

2436
05:36:03,792 --> 05:36:05,792
turn them over to friends--

2437
05:36:05,959 --> 05:36:10,166
as a reward
for the friends he's had...

2438
05:36:10,291 --> 05:36:15,458
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

2439
05:36:15,625 --> 05:36:18,291
- Not for years.
- Hear, hear.

2440
05:36:18,375 --> 05:36:22,208
The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

2441
05:36:23,750 --> 05:36:28,750
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana...

2442
05:36:28,875 --> 05:36:31,917
and there's no limit to
where we can go from here.

2443
05:36:32,041 --> 05:36:36,792
This kind of government knows how
to help business, to encourage it.

2444
05:36:36,917 --> 05:36:40,917
The hotels here
are bigger and swankier...

2445
05:36:41,041 --> 05:36:43,667
than any of the rough joints
we've put in in Vegas.

2446
05:36:43,792 --> 05:36:47,125
And we can thank our friends
in the Cuban government...

2447
05:36:47,208 --> 05:36:50,166
which has put up half of the cash,
with the Teamsters...

2448
05:36:50,291 --> 05:36:51,792
on a dollar-for-dollar basis;

2449
05:36:51,917 --> 05:36:54,750
has relaxed restrictions
on imports.

2450
05:36:54,875 --> 05:36:59,291
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed:

2451
05:36:59,417 --> 05:37:02,166
real partnership
with a government.

2452
05:37:02,208 --> 05:37:04,834
Smaller piece.

2453
05:37:04,917 --> 05:37:07,500
You all know Michael Corleone...

2454
05:37:07,583 --> 05:37:09,875
and we all remember his father.

2455
05:37:09,959 --> 05:37:13,625
At the time of my retirement
or death...

2456
05:37:13,709 --> 05:37:18,166
I turn over all my interest
in the Havana operation...

2457
05:37:18,291 --> 05:37:19,500
to his control.

2458
05:37:19,625 --> 05:37:23,667
But all of you will share.

2459
05:37:23,792 --> 05:37:27,500
The Nacionale will go to
the Lakeville Road boys.

2460
05:37:27,583 --> 05:37:33,458
The Capri to the Corleone family.
The Sevilla Biltmore also.

2461
05:37:33,583 --> 05:37:37,417
But Eddie Levine of Newport will
bring in the Pennino brothers...

2462
05:37:37,500 --> 05:37:39,291
Dino and Eddie, for a piece...

2463
05:37:39,417 --> 05:37:42,208
and also to handle
the actual casino operations.

2464
05:37:42,291 --> 05:37:45,875
And we've saved a piece for
some friends in Nevada...

2465
05:37:45,917 --> 05:37:49,625
to make sure that things
go smooth back home.

2466
05:37:49,750 --> 05:37:54,709
I want all of you
to enjoy your cake...

2467
05:37:54,792 --> 05:37:56,709
so enjoy.

2468
05:37:56,834 --> 05:37:58,709
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

2469
05:38:00,500 --> 05:38:04,458
I saw an interesting thing
happen today.

2470
05:38:04,583 --> 05:38:07,750
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police...

2471
05:38:07,875 --> 05:38:09,625
and rather than be taken alive...

2472
05:38:09,750 --> 05:38:12,333
he exploded a grenade he had
hidden in his jacket.

2473
05:38:12,458 --> 05:38:15,875
He killed himself, and he took
a captain of the command with him.

2474
05:38:15,917 --> 05:38:18,166
- Right,Johnny?
- Those rebels, they're lunatics.

2475
05:38:18,291 --> 05:38:21,500
- Yes, I agree.
- Maybe so.

2476
05:38:21,625 --> 05:38:23,250
But it occurred to me...

2477
05:38:23,333 --> 05:38:26,625
the soldiers are paid to fight,
the rebels aren't.

2478
05:38:26,750 --> 05:38:28,917
What does that tell you?

2479
05:38:29,041 --> 05:38:30,917
They could win.

2480
05:38:32,792 --> 05:38:35,583
This country has had rebels
for the last 50 years.

2481
05:38:35,709 --> 05:38:40,333
It's in their blood. I've been
coming here since the '20s.

2482
05:38:40,417 --> 05:38:44,250
We were running molasses out
of Havana when you were a baby...

2483
05:38:44,375 --> 05:38:47,917
the trucks owned by your father.

2484
05:38:48,083 --> 05:38:50,500
Michael.

2485
05:38:56,625 --> 05:38:59,500
I'd rather we talked about
this when we we're alone.

2486
05:39:02,500 --> 05:39:05,375
The two million
never got to the island.

2487
05:39:11,208 --> 05:39:14,375
I wouldn't want it to get around
that you held back the money...

2488
05:39:14,458 --> 05:39:17,792
because you had second thoughts
about the rebels.

2489
05:39:23,208 --> 05:39:26,125
Ah, sit down, Michael.

2490
05:39:26,208 --> 05:39:28,125
Sit down.

2491
05:39:34,583 --> 05:39:38,458
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

2492
05:39:38,500 --> 05:39:40,875
Ohh.

2493
05:39:41,000 --> 05:39:43,417
What I wouldn't give for...

2494
05:39:43,542 --> 05:39:45,458
20 more years.

2495
05:39:47,000 --> 05:39:49,542
Here we are, protected--

2496
05:39:49,667 --> 05:39:51,709
free to make our profiits without
Kefauver...

2497
05:39:51,792 --> 05:39:55,500
the goddamn Justice
Department and the FBl--

2498
05:39:55,583 --> 05:39:59,166
90 miles away, partnership
with a friendly government.

2499
05:40:00,583 --> 05:40:04,750
Ninety miles. It's nothing.

2500
05:40:04,875 --> 05:40:07,458
Just one small step,
looking for a man...

2501
05:40:07,583 --> 05:40:10,750
that wants to be President
of the United States...

2502
05:40:10,875 --> 05:40:14,208
and having the cash
to make it possible.

2503
05:40:14,333 --> 05:40:16,208
Michael...

2504
05:40:17,792 --> 05:40:20,709
we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

2505
05:40:46,875 --> 05:40:49,250
Mikey, how are ya? Okay?

2506
05:40:51,291 --> 05:40:54,041
Hiya. Freddie Corleone.

2507
05:40:57,250 --> 05:40:59,500
Jesus Christ, what a trip.

2508
05:40:59,625 --> 05:41:01,000
The whole time I'm thinkin'...

2509
05:41:01,125 --> 05:41:03,208
"What if somebody knows
what I got in here?"

2510
05:41:03,333 --> 05:41:07,667
Imagine that. Two million dollars
on the seat next to me.

2511
05:41:07,792 --> 05:41:09,625
All right.

2512
05:41:11,250 --> 05:41:13,625
- Whoops. Excuse me.
- No, it's okay.

2513
05:41:15,959 --> 05:41:17,875
You wanna count it?

2514
05:41:22,291 --> 05:41:25,750
Mikey, what the hell's
goin' on anyway?

2515
05:41:25,875 --> 05:41:28,083
The family's making
an investment in Havana.

2516
05:41:28,208 --> 05:41:31,500
- This is a gift for the president.
- Oh.

2517
05:41:31,583 --> 05:41:33,625
Well, that's great.

2518
05:41:33,709 --> 05:41:35,583
Havana's great.

2519
05:41:36,709 --> 05:41:38,625
It's my kind of town.

2520
05:41:40,125 --> 05:41:42,208
- Anybody I know in Havana?
- I don't know.

2521
05:41:42,333 --> 05:41:44,291
Hyman Roth? Johnny Ola?

2522
05:41:47,750 --> 05:41:50,291
No. I never met them.

2523
05:41:54,083 --> 05:41:56,333
Listen, Mikey...

2524
05:41:56,458 --> 05:41:58,375
I'm kind of, uh--

2525
05:42:01,875 --> 05:42:03,333
kind of nervous from the trip.

2526
05:42:03,417 --> 05:42:07,083
Uh, can l-- can I get
a, uh, drink or somethin'?

2527
05:42:07,166 --> 05:42:10,417
I thought maybe we'd--
we'd go out together.

2528
05:42:10,500 --> 05:42:13,458
I know a place we can spend
some time together. Okay?

2529
05:42:15,959 --> 05:42:19,125
Sometimes I think I should've
married a woman like you did...

2530
05:42:19,208 --> 05:42:21,625
Like Kay.

2531
05:42:21,709 --> 05:42:24,125
Have kids, have a family.

2532
05:42:26,750 --> 05:42:30,166
For once in my life
be more like...

2533
05:42:31,583 --> 05:42:33,208
Pop.

2534
05:42:35,417 --> 05:42:40,166
It's not easy to be a son,
Fredo. It's not easy.

2535
05:42:40,250 --> 05:42:43,417
Mama used to tease me. She'd say,
"You don't belong to me.

2536
05:42:43,500 --> 05:42:47,041
You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies."

2537
05:42:47,166 --> 05:42:50,041
Sometimes I think it's true.

2538
05:42:50,166 --> 05:42:52,000
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

2539
05:42:53,625 --> 05:42:55,667
Mikey, I--

2540
05:42:55,792 --> 05:42:57,709
I was mad at you.

2541
05:43:04,917 --> 05:43:08,875
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

2542
05:43:08,917 --> 05:43:11,375
You want a drink, right?
Waiter.

2543
05:43:19,125 --> 05:43:22,041
- How do you say banana daiquiri?
- Banana daiquiri.

2544
05:43:22,166 --> 05:43:24,417
- That's it?
- That's it.

2545
05:43:24,500 --> 05:43:27,417
- Uh, uno banana daiquiri.
- Banana daiquiri. Si, senor.

2546
05:43:27,458 --> 05:43:29,917
And, uh, a club soda.

2547
05:43:37,750 --> 05:43:40,500
Senator Geary's flying in
from Washington tomorrow night...

2548
05:43:40,625 --> 05:43:43,041
with some people,
some government people...

2549
05:43:43,166 --> 05:43:46,333
and I want you to show 'em
a good time in Havana.

2550
05:43:48,625 --> 05:43:51,125
It's my specialty, right?

2551
05:43:51,208 --> 05:43:54,375
- Can I trust you with something?
- Of course, Mike.

2552
05:43:58,166 --> 05:44:01,458
In the evening, we're all invited
to the presidential palace...

2553
05:44:01,583 --> 05:44:04,166
a reception to bring in
the new year.

2554
05:44:04,291 --> 05:44:06,166
After it's over...

2555
05:44:06,291 --> 05:44:08,792
they're gonna take me home
in a military car...

2556
05:44:08,917 --> 05:44:12,625
alone, for my protection...

2557
05:44:12,750 --> 05:44:16,125
and before I reach my hotel
I'll be assassinated.

2558
05:44:34,500 --> 05:44:37,542
- Who?
- Roth.

2559
05:44:43,333 --> 05:44:46,250
It was Roth who tried
to kill me in my home.

2560
05:44:48,041 --> 05:44:50,125
It was Roth all along.

2561
05:44:50,250 --> 05:44:55,458
He acts like I'm his son,
his successor...

2562
05:44:55,583 --> 05:44:58,458
but he thinks he's gonna live
forever and he wants me out.

2563
05:45:03,625 --> 05:45:04,709
How can I help?

2564
05:45:04,792 --> 05:45:08,166
You just go along
as though you know nothing.

2565
05:45:08,291 --> 05:45:12,208
- I've already made my move.
- What move?

2566
05:45:12,333 --> 05:45:14,792
Hyman Roth'll never see
the new year.

2567
05:45:32,125 --> 05:45:34,750
He says you have to take it easy
and he'll give you a prescription.

2568
05:45:34,792 --> 05:45:36,125
He'll be back tomorrow.

2569
05:45:36,166 --> 05:45:38,667
I want my own doctor.
Fly him in from Miami.

2570
05:45:38,750 --> 05:45:40,917
I don't trust a doctor
can't speak English.

2571
05:45:47,333 --> 05:45:49,166
Honey, go down to the casino.

2572
05:45:49,291 --> 05:45:52,709
- If you're sure you're better.
- Feel fine.

2573
05:45:54,709 --> 05:45:57,458
- Play the bingo game.
- Nice to see you, Mr. Paul.

2574
05:45:57,583 --> 05:45:59,542
-Just make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

2575
05:46:01,417 --> 05:46:02,750
My sixth sense tells me...

2576
05:46:02,875 --> 05:46:05,417
your brother Fredo brought
a bag full of money.

2577
05:46:05,500 --> 05:46:08,709
Where is it?

2578
05:46:08,834 --> 05:46:11,208
You're pulling out?

2579
05:46:11,291 --> 05:46:15,208
Just wanna--
I just wanna wait.

2580
05:46:18,625 --> 05:46:21,208
How do you feel?

2581
05:46:21,333 --> 05:46:23,500
Terrible. I'd give four million...

2582
05:46:23,583 --> 05:46:26,875
just to be able to take a piss
without it hurting.

2583
05:46:26,959 --> 05:46:30,250
Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?

2584
05:46:30,375 --> 05:46:32,709
The Rosato brothers.

2585
05:46:32,792 --> 05:46:36,417
I know. But who gave
the go-ahead?

2586
05:46:36,458 --> 05:46:39,417
I know I didn't.

2587
05:46:46,583 --> 05:46:49,125
There was this kid
I grew up with.

2588
05:46:49,208 --> 05:46:51,417
He was younger than me.

2589
05:46:51,542 --> 05:46:54,000
Sort of looked up to me,
you know.

2590
05:46:54,125 --> 05:46:57,625
We did our first work together.

2591
05:46:57,750 --> 05:46:59,834
Worked our way
out of the street.

2592
05:46:59,917 --> 05:47:01,917
Things were good.
We made the most of it.

2593
05:47:03,250 --> 05:47:05,792
During Prohibition...

2594
05:47:05,917 --> 05:47:07,834
we ran molasses into Canada.

2595
05:47:07,917 --> 05:47:10,458
Made a fortune. Your father too.

2596
05:47:12,959 --> 05:47:16,000
As much as anyone...

2597
05:47:16,125 --> 05:47:18,625
I loved him and trusted him.

2598
05:47:21,667 --> 05:47:25,125
Later on he had an idea...

2599
05:47:25,250 --> 05:47:27,417
to build a city...

2600
05:47:27,500 --> 05:47:31,208
out of a desert stopover for G.I.s
on their way to the West Coast.

2601
05:47:33,250 --> 05:47:37,000
That kid's name was Moe Green...

2602
05:47:37,041 --> 05:47:40,333
and the city he invented
was Las Vegas.

2603
05:47:42,041 --> 05:47:44,500
This was a great man...

2604
05:47:44,625 --> 05:47:47,083
a man of vision and guts...

2605
05:47:47,208 --> 05:47:52,375
and there isn't even a plaque
or a signpost or a statue of him...

2606
05:47:52,500 --> 05:47:55,333
in that town.

2607
05:47:55,458 --> 05:47:58,917
Someone put a bullet
through his eye.

2608
05:48:00,333 --> 05:48:03,500
No one knows
who gave the order.

2609
05:48:03,625 --> 05:48:06,750
When I heard it I wasn't angry.

2610
05:48:06,917 --> 05:48:08,917
I knew Moe;
I knew he was headstrong.

2611
05:48:09,041 --> 05:48:12,875
Talking loud,
saying stupid things.

2612
05:48:13,041 --> 05:48:16,208
So when he turned up dead...

2613
05:48:16,333 --> 05:48:19,583
I let it go...

2614
05:48:19,625 --> 05:48:22,917
and I said to myself...

2615
05:48:23,000 --> 05:48:26,917
"This is the business
we've chosen."

2616
05:48:27,000 --> 05:48:29,792
I didn't ask...

2617
05:48:29,875 --> 05:48:31,792
who gave the order...

2618
05:48:31,917 --> 05:48:34,875
because it had nothing
to do with business.

2619
05:48:43,500 --> 05:48:47,417
That two million
in a bag in your room--

2620
05:48:50,291 --> 05:48:52,250
I'm going in...

2621
05:48:52,333 --> 05:48:54,417
to take a nap.

2622
05:48:54,458 --> 05:48:56,625
When I wake...

2623
05:48:56,709 --> 05:49:00,375
if the money's on the table
I'll know I have a partner.

2624
05:49:00,500 --> 05:49:02,875
If it isn't,
I'll know I don't.

2625
05:49:58,583 --> 05:50:00,667
All right, does everybody
know everybody here, huh?

2626
05:50:00,792 --> 05:50:02,792
- This is Senator Geary.
- How are you, Senator?

2627
05:50:02,875 --> 05:50:06,125
Good to see you, Mike. I'm glad
we could spend time together.

2628
05:50:06,208 --> 05:50:09,291
- Senator Payton from Florida.
- How you doing, Mike?

2629
05:50:09,375 --> 05:50:11,792
- And Judge DeMalco from New York.
- How do you do, sir?

2630
05:50:11,917 --> 05:50:14,083
- Fine, thank you.
- Senator Ream from Maryland.

2631
05:50:14,208 --> 05:50:17,458
- I've been looking forward to this.
- This is Fred Corngold from U.T.T.

2632
05:50:17,542 --> 05:50:21,041
- I know Fred. How are you?
- Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha.

2633
05:50:21,166 --> 05:50:24,625
- Oh, he does, huh?
- Gentlemen, it's refiill time.

2634
05:50:24,750 --> 05:50:29,291
Try some of them local drinks--
uh, cuba libre, pina colada.

2635
05:50:29,417 --> 05:50:33,291
I think I'll try one of
those redheaded Yolandas.

2636
05:50:33,333 --> 05:50:37,333
- That you got. Congusto.
- Johnny.

2637
05:50:37,417 --> 05:50:41,041
You don't know my brother Fredo,
do you, Johnny? Johnny Ola, Fredo.

2638
05:50:41,166 --> 05:50:43,291
- We never met. Johnny Ola.
- Pleasure.

2639
05:50:46,000 --> 05:50:48,291
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana.

2640
05:50:48,375 --> 05:50:50,291
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

2641
05:50:51,583 --> 05:50:54,208
- Happy New Year.
- That's right, huh?

2642
05:50:58,417 --> 05:51:01,750
- Checkin' in now. Right now.
- Never fear! Pat Geary's here!

2643
05:51:01,875 --> 05:51:04,709
- Hey, Fred.
- Cheers! Hey!

2644
05:51:04,750 --> 05:51:07,291
- Hey, Freddie, why are we standin'?
- Come on, man!

2645
05:51:07,417 --> 05:51:10,166
Everybody stands,
but it's worth it.

2646
05:51:10,291 --> 05:51:13,041
- You're not gonna believe this.
- I don't believe it already.

2647
05:51:13,125 --> 05:51:16,709
- That's right. Fifty dollars.
- You got a bet, mister.

2648
05:51:25,166 --> 05:51:27,625
That's him. That's Superman.

2649
05:52:00,291 --> 05:52:02,875
- Jesus Christ!
- Did I tell ya, or did I tell ya?

2650
05:52:04,625 --> 05:52:07,208
- I don't believe it.
- That thing's gotta be a fake.

2651
05:52:07,333 --> 05:52:11,208
That ain't no fake. That's real.
That's why they call him Superman.

2652
05:52:11,333 --> 05:52:15,333
Hey, Freddie. Freddie.
Where did you find this place?

2653
05:52:15,458 --> 05:52:17,792
Johnny Ola told me about
this place. He brought me here.

2654
05:52:17,875 --> 05:52:19,834
I didn't believe it,
but seein' is believin', huh?

2655
05:52:19,917 --> 05:52:23,375
- I see it and I don't believe it.
- Fifty bucks, Pat.

2656
05:52:23,500 --> 05:52:25,041
Old man Roth'd never come here...

2657
05:52:25,166 --> 05:52:28,041
but ol'Johnny knows these places
like the back of his hand.

2658
05:52:28,125 --> 05:52:30,709
Now watch him. He's gonna
break the cracker with it.

2659
05:52:30,792 --> 05:52:34,041
I wanna see him break a brick.

2660
05:52:34,166 --> 05:52:36,583
He could knock down a building.

2661
05:53:55,000 --> 05:53:58,208
Relax, Senor Roth. We're
taking you to the hospital.

2662
05:54:47,333 --> 05:54:49,750
And in my judgment
you'll continue to get those...

2663
05:54:49,875 --> 05:54:52,709
because I don't believe
that President Eisenhower...

2664
05:54:52,792 --> 05:54:54,291
will ever pull out of Cuba.

2665
05:54:54,417 --> 05:54:58,083
Not as long as we have over one billion
dollars invested in this country.

2666
05:55:01,291 --> 05:55:04,917
Now, the American public
believes in nonintervention.

2667
05:55:05,000 --> 05:55:07,917
Fredo. Where you goin'?

2668
05:55:08,000 --> 05:55:11,208
I'm gonna get me a real drink,
'cause I can't--

2669
05:56:07,250 --> 05:56:10,709
What kept Mr. Roth?
I understood he was coming.

2670
05:56:10,834 --> 05:56:14,291
Ream, what's the protocol? How long
should we stay around here?

2671
05:56:14,417 --> 05:56:17,333
Oh, I don't know. I think
a half hour oughta do it.

2672
05:56:17,458 --> 05:56:19,917
Just long enough
to bring in the new year.

2673
05:57:54,458 --> 05:57:58,417
There's a plane waiting for us
to take us to Miami in an hour.

2674
05:57:58,500 --> 05:58:00,917
Don't make a big thing about it.

2675
05:58:05,041 --> 05:58:07,417
I know it was you, Fredo.

2676
05:58:07,542 --> 05:58:10,333
You broke my heart.

2677
05:58:10,417 --> 05:58:13,417
You broke my heart.

2678
05:59:54,625 --> 05:59:58,000
Fredo! Come on.

2679
05:59:58,125 --> 06:00:01,417
Come with me. It's the only
way out of here tonight.

2680
06:00:01,500 --> 06:00:04,125
Roth is dead. Fredo.

2681
06:00:04,208 --> 06:00:07,166
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother!

2682
06:00:07,250 --> 06:00:10,083
Fredo! Fredo!

2683
06:00:29,125 --> 06:00:30,917
U.S. passports only.

2684
06:00:33,667 --> 06:00:38,458
- U.S. passports only.
- I'm from the United States Senate.

2685
06:00:41,125 --> 06:00:43,458
- Back, please.
- Please! I must leave!

2686
06:01:51,875 --> 06:01:54,917
Al, get me a wet towel.

2687
06:02:01,959 --> 06:02:03,875
Kay know I'm back?

2688
06:02:08,625 --> 06:02:11,917
What about my boy? Did you get
him something for Christmas?

2689
06:02:12,083 --> 06:02:15,583
- I took care of it.
- What was it so I'll know?

2690
06:02:15,667 --> 06:02:19,125
It was a little car with an electric
motor that he could ride in.

2691
06:02:19,208 --> 06:02:21,125
It was nice.

2692
06:02:23,333 --> 06:02:26,166
Thank you, Al.

2693
06:02:26,291 --> 06:02:28,750
Fellas, could you step outside
for a minute, please?

2694
06:02:46,917 --> 06:02:48,792
Where's my brother?

2695
06:02:48,917 --> 06:02:52,792
Uh, Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

2696
06:02:52,917 --> 06:02:55,875
He had a stroke.
He recovered okay.

2697
06:02:56,000 --> 06:03:00,458
- Your bodyguard's dead.
- I asked about Fredo.

2698
06:03:00,542 --> 06:03:03,500
I think he got out. He must be
somewhere in New York.

2699
06:03:06,959 --> 06:03:09,458
All right.

2700
06:03:09,583 --> 06:03:12,458
I want you to get
in touch with him.

2701
06:03:12,583 --> 06:03:15,542
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything's all right.

2702
06:03:15,667 --> 06:03:17,375
Tell him I know Roth misled him;

2703
06:03:17,458 --> 06:03:20,083
that he didn't know
they were gonna try to kill me.

2704
06:03:22,000 --> 06:03:24,208
And they can come in now.

2705
06:03:24,333 --> 06:03:27,041
Oh, there was something else.

2706
06:03:27,166 --> 06:03:29,750
What?

2707
06:03:34,750 --> 06:03:36,667
What?
Come on. What?

2708
06:03:39,166 --> 06:03:41,333
Kay had a miscarriage.
She lost the baby.

2709
06:03:54,333 --> 06:03:56,792
- Was it a boy?
- After three and a half months--

2710
06:03:56,875 --> 06:04:01,166
Can't you give me a straight answer
anymore? Was it a boy?

2711
06:04:03,792 --> 06:04:05,667
I really don't know.

2712
06:06:49,000 --> 06:06:51,834
From the year 1942
to the present time...

2713
06:06:51,959 --> 06:06:55,542
you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?

2714
06:06:55,667 --> 06:06:57,208
That's right.

2715
06:06:58,333 --> 06:07:02,208
But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organization?

2716
06:07:05,458 --> 06:07:09,166
We called it the Corleone family,
Senator. We called it the family.

2717
06:07:09,291 --> 06:07:11,667
What was your position?

2718
06:07:12,792 --> 06:07:15,667
At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.

2719
06:07:15,792 --> 06:07:19,208
- What is that?
- A button. You know, come on.

2720
06:07:19,333 --> 06:07:21,583
No, I don't know. Tell me.

2721
06:07:23,333 --> 06:07:27,458
When the boss says "push a button
on a guy," I push a button.

2722
06:07:27,542 --> 06:07:30,041
- See, Senator?
- Mr. Questadt.

2723
06:07:30,166 --> 06:07:33,041
- You mean you killed people?
- What?

2724
06:07:33,166 --> 06:07:38,125
You killed people
at the behest of your superiors?

2725
06:07:42,041 --> 06:07:43,250
Yeah, that's right, counselor.

2726
06:07:43,375 --> 06:07:49,000
And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?

2727
06:07:49,125 --> 06:07:52,166
Yeah, counselor, Michael Corleone,
right.

2728
06:07:52,291 --> 06:07:55,667
Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?

2729
06:07:56,792 --> 06:07:59,000
No, I never talked to him.

2730
06:07:59,083 --> 06:08:02,875
Mr. Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit, please?

2731
06:08:03,000 --> 06:08:04,709
Do what?

2732
06:08:04,834 --> 06:08:09,125
Could you expand on your answer?
I'm interested in knowing...

2733
06:08:09,250 --> 06:08:11,583
was there always a buffer involved?

2734
06:08:12,542 --> 06:08:15,583
Someone in between you
and your possible superiors...

2735
06:08:15,709 --> 06:08:19,125
- who gave the actual orders?
- Yeah, right, a buffer.

2736
06:08:19,250 --> 06:08:22,417
The family had a lot of buffers.

2737
06:08:22,500 --> 06:08:24,583
Mr. Cicci,
you may find this very amusing...

2738
06:08:24,667 --> 06:08:27,667
but I promise you the members
of this committee do not.

2739
06:10:16,750 --> 06:10:19,917
- Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
- Yes, I am.

2740
06:10:20,041 --> 06:10:24,083
- And where was he born?
- Corleone, Sicily.

2741
06:10:24,166 --> 06:10:26,375
Did he, at times, use an alias...

2742
06:10:26,500 --> 06:10:29,875
that was known in certain circles
as "Godfather"?

2743
06:10:30,792 --> 06:10:33,792
"Godfather" is a term
that was used by his friends...

2744
06:10:33,875 --> 06:10:37,750
one of affection,
one of respect.

2745
06:10:37,875 --> 06:10:42,333
Mr. Chairman, I would like
to verify the witness's statement.

2746
06:10:42,417 --> 06:10:45,000
For years now, a growing number
of my constituents...

2747
06:10:45,083 --> 06:10:47,667
have been of ltalian descent...

2748
06:10:47,750 --> 06:10:49,750
and I've come to know them well.

2749
06:10:49,834 --> 06:10:55,000
They have honored me with their
support and with their friendship.

2750
06:10:55,125 --> 06:10:58,291
Indeed, I can proudly say
that some of my very best friends...

2751
06:10:58,375 --> 06:11:00,291
are ltalian-Americans.

2752
06:11:01,291 --> 06:11:06,417
However, Mr. Chairman, at this time,
I have to leave these proceedings...

2753
06:11:06,500 --> 06:11:11,375
to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.

2754
06:11:11,500 --> 06:11:14,625
But before I leave,
I do want to say this--

2755
06:11:14,709 --> 06:11:19,250
that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever...

2756
06:11:19,375 --> 06:11:21,625
a slur upon
the great Italian people...

2757
06:11:21,750 --> 06:11:24,959
because I can state from
my own knowledge and experience...

2758
06:11:25,083 --> 06:11:28,750
that Italian-Americans are among
the most loyal...

2759
06:11:28,834 --> 06:11:31,125
most law-abiding, patriotic...

2760
06:11:31,250 --> 06:11:34,875
hard-working American citizens
in this land.

2761
06:11:35,000 --> 06:11:37,417
And it would be a shame,
Mr. Chairman...

2762
06:11:37,500 --> 06:11:39,667
if we allowed
a few rotten apples...

2763
06:11:39,792 --> 06:11:42,500
to give a bad name
to the whole barrel...

2764
06:11:42,583 --> 06:11:45,166
because from the time
of the great Christopher Columbus...

2765
06:11:45,291 --> 06:11:48,041
up to the time of Enrico Fermi...

2766
06:11:48,166 --> 06:11:50,166
right up until the present day...

2767
06:11:50,250 --> 06:11:52,166
Italian-Americans
have been pioneers...

2768
06:11:52,250 --> 06:11:54,458
in building and defending
our great nation.

2769
06:11:54,583 --> 06:11:56,792
They are the salt of the earth.

2770
06:11:56,917 --> 06:11:59,792
They are one of the backbones
of this country.

2771
06:12:03,959 --> 06:12:06,417
The chairman is calling
the meeting back to order.

2772
06:12:06,500 --> 06:12:10,125
I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.

2773
06:12:10,250 --> 06:12:14,166
Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been
advised as to your legal rights.

2774
06:12:14,291 --> 06:12:17,959
We have testimony from a witness,
a previous witness...

2775
06:12:18,041 --> 06:12:20,583
one Willi Cicci.

2776
06:12:20,709 --> 06:12:22,583
He has stated that you are head...

2777
06:12:22,709 --> 06:12:25,000
of the most powerful Mafia family
in this country.

2778
06:12:25,083 --> 06:12:28,000
- Are you?
- No, I'm not.

2779
06:12:28,083 --> 06:12:31,583
The witness has testified that
you are personally responsible...

2780
06:12:31,709 --> 06:12:35,333
for the murder of a New York City
police captain in 1947.

2781
06:12:35,458 --> 06:12:39,166
And with him,
a man named Virgil Solozzo.

2782
06:12:39,291 --> 06:12:41,542
- Do you deny this?
- Yes, I do.

2783
06:12:41,667 --> 06:12:44,917
Is it true that in the year 1950...

2784
06:12:45,000 --> 06:12:49,375
you devised a murder of the heads
of the so-called "five families"...

2785
06:12:49,500 --> 06:12:51,792
in New York, to assume
and consolidate...

2786
06:12:51,875 --> 06:12:54,291
your nefarious power?

2787
06:12:54,375 --> 06:12:58,208
- That's a complete falsehood.
- Is it true...

2788
06:12:58,333 --> 06:13:02,208
you have a controlling interest
in three major hotels in Las Vegas?

2789
06:13:03,458 --> 06:13:07,083
No, it is not true. I own some stock
in some of the hotels there...

2790
06:13:07,208 --> 06:13:09,250
but very little.

2791
06:13:11,458 --> 06:13:15,542
I also have stock in IBM and IT&T.

2792
06:13:15,667 --> 06:13:21,000
Do you have any interests or control
over gambling and narcotics...

2793
06:13:21,125 --> 06:13:22,583
in the state of New York?

2794
06:13:22,709 --> 06:13:24,625
No, I do not.

2795
06:13:24,709 --> 06:13:27,875
Senator, my client would like to
read a statement for this committee.

2796
06:13:28,000 --> 06:13:31,792
Mr. Chairman,
I think this statement...

2797
06:13:31,917 --> 06:13:34,083
is totally out of order
at this time.

2798
06:13:34,208 --> 06:13:38,000
Sir, my client has answered every
question asked by this committee...

2799
06:13:38,125 --> 06:13:39,875
with the utmost sincerity.

2800
06:13:39,959 --> 06:13:42,917
He did not take the Fifth Amendment,
as it was his right to do...

2801
06:13:43,000 --> 06:13:45,667
so in all fairness I think
the statement should be heard.

2802
06:13:47,959 --> 06:13:51,125
No, I'm going to allow Mr. Corleone
to read his statement.

2803
06:13:51,208 --> 06:13:52,625
I'll put it in the record.

2804
06:13:54,625 --> 06:13:57,750
"In the hopes of clearing
my family name...

2805
06:13:57,875 --> 06:14:00,417
and my sincere desire to give
my children their fair share...

2806
06:14:00,542 --> 06:14:02,583
of the American way of life
without a blemish...

2807
06:14:02,709 --> 06:14:05,041
on their name and background...

2808
06:14:05,125 --> 06:14:07,166
I have appeared
before this committee...

2809
06:14:07,250 --> 06:14:10,166
and given it all the cooperation
in my power.

2810
06:14:11,542 --> 06:14:14,500
I consider it a great dishonor
to me personally...

2811
06:14:14,625 --> 06:14:17,000
to have to deny
that I am a criminal.

2812
06:14:17,959 --> 06:14:21,625
I wish to have the following
noted for the record:

2813
06:14:21,709 --> 06:14:25,750
that I served my country faithfully
and honorably in World War Two...

2814
06:14:25,834 --> 06:14:30,250
and was awarded a Navy Cross for
actions in defense of my country...

2815
06:14:31,834 --> 06:14:36,208
that I have never been arrested or
indicted for any crime whatsoever...

2816
06:14:36,333 --> 06:14:40,375
that no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy...

2817
06:14:40,500 --> 06:14:43,125
whether it is called "Mafia,"
"Cosa Nostra"...

2818
06:14:43,250 --> 06:14:45,125
or whatever other name
you wish to give...

2819
06:14:45,250 --> 06:14:46,625
has ever been made public.

2820
06:14:47,917 --> 06:14:50,750
I have not taken refuge
behind the Fifth Amendment...

2821
06:14:50,834 --> 06:14:52,917
although it is my right to do so.

2822
06:14:55,959 --> 06:14:57,959
I challenge this committee...

2823
06:14:58,041 --> 06:15:01,500
to produce any witness
or evidence against me.

2824
06:15:01,625 --> 06:15:04,041
And if they do not...

2825
06:15:04,166 --> 06:15:07,625
I hope they will have the decency
to clear my name...

2826
06:15:07,709 --> 06:15:11,041
with the same publicity with which
they now have besmirched it."

2827
06:15:12,709 --> 06:15:15,709
I'm sure we're all quite impressed,
Mr. Corleone...

2828
06:15:15,834 --> 06:15:18,291
particularly with your love
for our country.

2829
06:15:18,417 --> 06:15:21,083
Committee will stand in recess
until 10:00 a.m. Monday morning...

2830
06:15:21,208 --> 06:15:23,125
at which time the committee
will produce a witness...

2831
06:15:23,208 --> 06:15:25,959
who will corroborate the charges
which were made against you today...

2832
06:15:26,041 --> 06:15:29,041
and at which time, Mr. Corleone,
you may very well be subject...

2833
06:15:29,166 --> 06:15:31,208
to indictment for perjury.

2834
06:15:31,333 --> 06:15:33,458
I remind you that
you're still under subpoena.

2835
06:15:33,542 --> 06:15:35,458
Adjourned.

2836
06:15:39,667 --> 06:15:42,458
Ten-to-one shot, you said.

2837
06:15:42,542 --> 06:15:45,542
Ten-to-one shot
he would take the Fifth...

2838
06:15:45,625 --> 06:15:47,375
and I lose.

2839
06:15:47,458 --> 06:15:49,458
You sound like my bookie.

2840
06:15:49,583 --> 06:15:51,625
I owe that monkey my life.

2841
06:15:53,458 --> 06:15:55,458
Well, just get
a good night's sleep.

2842
06:15:55,583 --> 06:15:58,959
- Good night's sleep.
- Got a big day tomorrow.

2843
06:15:59,083 --> 06:16:02,000
Got you a new suit,
a new shirt, new tie.

2844
06:16:03,625 --> 06:16:06,000
I'm gonna shave you myself
in the morning.

2845
06:16:06,959 --> 06:16:10,917
You're gonna look respectable for
50 million of your fellow Americans.

2846
06:16:12,375 --> 06:16:17,250
My life won't be worth a nickel
after tomorrow.

2847
06:16:17,375 --> 06:16:20,750
Come on.
I saw this thing 19 times.

2848
06:16:22,125 --> 06:16:24,667
You got a great home here, Frankie.

2849
06:16:24,750 --> 06:16:28,750
The rest of your life, nobody gets
near you, you're not going anywhere.

2850
06:16:28,834 --> 06:16:32,083
That's great.
Beautiful.

2851
06:16:32,166 --> 06:16:34,166
Some deal I made.

2852
06:16:34,250 --> 06:16:37,000
You'll live like a king.
You'll be a hero.

2853
06:16:37,125 --> 06:16:40,166
You'll live better in here
than most people on the outside.

2854
06:16:40,291 --> 06:16:43,083
Some deal.
Jesus.

2855
06:16:44,875 --> 06:16:48,750
Alive.
Pentangeli is alive.

2856
06:16:50,625 --> 06:16:55,750
- How'd they get their hands on him?
- Roth. He engineered it.

2857
06:16:56,542 --> 06:16:58,959
Frankie went to make a deal
with the Rosato brothers...

2858
06:16:59,083 --> 06:17:01,166
and they tried to kill him.

2859
06:17:01,291 --> 06:17:03,166
He thought you double-crossed him.

2860
06:17:04,792 --> 06:17:07,083
Our people with the New York
detective said he was half dead...

2861
06:17:07,166 --> 06:17:10,875
scared stiff and calling out loud
that you turned on him.

2862
06:17:11,000 --> 06:17:13,709
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one...

2863
06:17:13,834 --> 06:17:15,709
and a lot more.

2864
06:17:17,208 --> 06:17:19,917
The FBI has him airtight.

2865
06:17:20,041 --> 06:17:22,875
He's on an army base,
24-hour guards.

2866
06:17:23,000 --> 06:17:25,208
No way we can get to him.

2867
06:17:25,291 --> 06:17:28,250
You've opened yourself
to five counts of perjury.

2868
06:17:30,458 --> 06:17:33,417
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

2869
06:17:33,500 --> 06:17:36,208
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

2870
06:17:37,125 --> 06:17:41,041
Roth-- he played this one
beautifully.

2871
06:17:49,208 --> 06:17:51,083
I want to talk to Fredo.

2872
06:18:30,834 --> 06:18:32,750
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

2873
06:18:35,250 --> 06:18:37,750
We have time.

2874
06:18:37,875 --> 06:18:40,792
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

2875
06:18:42,458 --> 06:18:44,333
I didn't know all that much.

2876
06:18:45,625 --> 06:18:50,125
What about now? ls there anything
you can help me out with?

2877
06:18:50,917 --> 06:18:52,834
Anything you can tell me now?

2878
06:18:55,166 --> 06:18:57,542
They got Pentangeli,
that's all I can tell you.

2879
06:19:12,458 --> 06:19:16,000
I didn't know
it was gonna be a hit, Mike.

2880
06:19:16,125 --> 06:19:18,417
I swear to God,
I didn't know it was gonna be a hit.

2881
06:19:21,458 --> 06:19:25,834
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills...

2882
06:19:27,583 --> 06:19:30,000
and he said
that he wanted to talk.

2883
06:19:32,291 --> 06:19:35,041
He said that you and Roth...

2884
06:19:35,166 --> 06:19:38,542
were in on a big deal together...

2885
06:19:40,917 --> 06:19:45,166
and that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

2886
06:19:45,250 --> 06:19:49,125
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations.

2887
06:19:49,208 --> 06:19:53,625
But if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast...

2888
06:19:55,375 --> 06:19:57,625
it'd be good for the family.

2889
06:19:59,375 --> 06:20:01,458
You believed that story?

2890
06:20:01,542 --> 06:20:03,917
You believed that?

2891
06:20:04,041 --> 06:20:07,667
He said there was something in it
for me... on my own.

2892
06:20:07,792 --> 06:20:10,417
I've always taken care of you.

2893
06:20:10,542 --> 06:20:12,417
Taken care of me?

2894
06:20:13,542 --> 06:20:17,291
You're my kid brother.
You take care of me?

2895
06:20:17,417 --> 06:20:22,542
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

2896
06:20:22,625 --> 06:20:26,041
Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that.

2897
06:20:27,500 --> 06:20:31,709
Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere.

2898
06:20:31,834 --> 06:20:34,709
Send Fredo to pick somebody up
at the airport.

2899
06:20:34,834 --> 06:20:38,125
I'm your older brother, Mike,
and I was stepped over!

2900
06:20:38,208 --> 06:20:43,000
- That's the way Pop wanted it.
- It ain't the way I wanted it!

2901
06:20:43,083 --> 06:20:45,583
I can handle things!
I'm smart!

2902
06:20:45,709 --> 06:20:49,667
Not like everybody says.
Like dumb. I'm smart...

2903
06:20:49,750 --> 06:20:51,834
and I want respect!

2904
06:20:59,750 --> 06:21:02,917
Is there anything you can tell me
about this investigation?

2905
06:21:03,000 --> 06:21:04,917
Anything more?

2906
06:21:12,959 --> 06:21:17,041
The Senate lawyer, Questadt...

2907
06:21:17,166 --> 06:21:18,709
he belongs to Roth.

2908
06:21:32,834 --> 06:21:34,917
You're nothing to me now.

2909
06:21:37,333 --> 06:21:39,542
You're not a brother,
you're not a friend.

2910
06:21:41,583 --> 06:21:44,375
I don't wanna know you
or what you do.

2911
06:21:45,542 --> 06:21:48,667
I don't wanna see you at the hotels.

2912
06:21:48,792 --> 06:21:51,208
I don't want you near my house.

2913
06:21:53,333 --> 06:21:56,208
When you see our mother,
I wanna know a day in advance...

2914
06:21:56,291 --> 06:21:57,750
so I won't be there.

2915
06:21:59,709 --> 06:22:02,417
You understand?

2916
06:22:19,542 --> 06:22:23,375
I don't want anything to happen
to him while my mother's alive.

2917
06:23:13,333 --> 06:23:16,959
There are more people
than a ball game in here.

2918
06:23:17,041 --> 06:23:18,959
There's Willi Cicci.

2919
06:23:41,000 --> 06:23:42,917
This committee will come to order.

2920
06:23:45,917 --> 06:23:48,583
- State your name, please.
- Frank Pentangeli.

2921
06:23:48,667 --> 06:23:52,375
- And where were you born?
- Partanego. Outside of Palermo.

2922
06:23:52,500 --> 06:23:54,709
Where do you live now?

2923
06:23:54,834 --> 06:23:59,208
I live in an army barracks
with the FBI guys.

2924
06:24:00,333 --> 06:24:05,500
We have here, finally, a witness
that will further testify...

2925
06:24:05,583 --> 06:24:08,291
to Michael Corleone's rule
over a criminal empire...

2926
06:24:08,417 --> 06:24:10,417
that controls all of the gambling
in this country...

2927
06:24:10,542 --> 06:24:11,917
and perhaps in other countries.

2928
06:24:12,041 --> 06:24:17,291
This witness had no buffer between
himself and Michael Corleone.

2929
06:24:17,417 --> 06:24:20,959
He can corroborate our charges on
enough counts for this committee...

2930
06:24:21,083 --> 06:24:25,458
to recommend a charge of perjury
against Michael Corleone.

2931
06:24:25,542 --> 06:24:27,250
- Senator.
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

2932
06:24:28,750 --> 06:24:30,000
Mr. Pentangeli.

2933
06:24:34,208 --> 06:24:37,333
Were you a member
of the Corleone family?

2934
06:24:37,417 --> 06:24:42,000
Did you serve under
caporegime Peter Clemenza...

2935
06:24:42,083 --> 06:24:46,750
under Vito Corleone,
also known as the "Godfather"?

2936
06:24:53,125 --> 06:24:55,250
I never knew no Godfather.

2937
06:24:58,000 --> 06:24:59,917
I have my own family, Senator.

2938
06:25:03,875 --> 06:25:08,166
Mr. Pentangeli, you are
contradicting a sworn statement...

2939
06:25:08,250 --> 06:25:10,166
you'd previously made to me
and signed.

2940
06:25:10,250 --> 06:25:13,834
I ask you again, sir,
here and now under oath...

2941
06:25:13,917 --> 06:25:18,458
were you at anytime
a member of a crime organization...

2942
06:25:18,583 --> 06:25:19,959
headed by Michael Corleone?

2943
06:25:20,083 --> 06:25:23,750
I don't know nothing about that.

2944
06:25:26,834 --> 06:25:30,792
I was in the olive oil business
with his father...

2945
06:25:30,875 --> 06:25:33,291
but that was a long time ago,
that's all.

2946
06:25:34,417 --> 06:25:36,333
We have a sworn affidavit.

2947
06:25:37,834 --> 06:25:40,917
We have it--
your sworn affidavit...

2948
06:25:41,041 --> 06:25:43,500
that you murdered on
the orders of Michael Corleone.

2949
06:25:43,625 --> 06:25:45,792
Do you deny that confession?

2950
06:25:45,917 --> 06:25:48,667
And do you realize what will happen
as a result of your denial?

2951
06:25:48,750 --> 06:25:51,875
Look, the FBI guys,
they promised me a deal...

2952
06:25:52,000 --> 06:25:55,750
so I made up a lot of stuff
about Michael Corleone...

2953
06:25:55,834 --> 06:25:57,792
'cause that's what they wanted.

2954
06:25:57,917 --> 06:26:01,750
But it was all lies--
everything.

2955
06:26:02,667 --> 06:26:05,041
And they kept saying...

2956
06:26:05,166 --> 06:26:07,291
Michael Corleone did this...

2957
06:26:07,417 --> 06:26:09,959
and that Michael Corleone did that.

2958
06:26:11,417 --> 06:26:15,500
So I said, "Yeah, sure!"

2959
06:26:15,625 --> 06:26:19,208
Mr. Corleone, would you kindly
identify for the committee...

2960
06:26:19,333 --> 06:26:21,250
the gentleman sitting
to your left?

2961
06:26:21,333 --> 06:26:23,250
I can answer that.

2962
06:26:24,542 --> 06:26:27,542
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

2963
06:26:27,625 --> 06:26:31,750
- Is he related to the witness?
- He is, I believe, his brother.

2964
06:26:31,834 --> 06:26:34,333
Will he come forward
and be sworn, sir?

2965
06:26:34,458 --> 06:26:37,125
Sir, this man
does not understand English.

2966
06:26:37,250 --> 06:26:40,875
He came at his own expense to aid
his brother in this time of trouble.

2967
06:26:41,000 --> 06:26:44,667
He's not under subpoena.
His reputation is impeccable.

2968
06:26:44,750 --> 06:26:46,625
Are you saying he knows nothing
about these matters?

2969
06:26:46,709 --> 06:26:48,125
To my knowledge, nothing.

2970
06:26:48,208 --> 06:26:51,208
I'm gonna find out
what the hell happened here.

2971
06:26:51,291 --> 06:26:53,291
Allright, this committee
is now adjourned.

2972
06:26:53,417 --> 06:26:55,583
- The witness is excused.
- Senator!

2973
06:26:57,959 --> 06:27:00,792
This committee owes an apology!

2974
06:27:00,917 --> 06:27:04,792
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator.

2975
06:27:32,667 --> 06:27:36,291
- Michael, excuse me.
- Hold on a minute.

2976
06:27:36,417 --> 06:27:39,125
The children are outside.
We're going.

2977
06:27:41,959 --> 06:27:44,250
What do you mean you're going?
We're all gonna leave tomorrow.

2978
06:27:48,834 --> 06:27:50,750
I'll be in my room.

2979
06:27:54,166 --> 06:27:57,125
Michael, I'm not going
back to Nevada.

2980
06:27:57,250 --> 06:28:00,125
I brought the children
to say good-bye to you.

2981
06:28:04,000 --> 06:28:06,125
I want you to know
I'm very happy for you.

2982
06:28:06,250 --> 06:28:08,750
I suppose I always knew
you were too smart...

2983
06:28:08,875 --> 06:28:10,792
to let any of them
ever beat you.

2984
06:28:12,667 --> 06:28:17,125
- Why don't you sit down?
- I'm not going to stay long.

2985
06:28:17,250 --> 06:28:19,667
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

2986
06:28:21,417 --> 06:28:23,834
Some things that have been
on my mind.

2987
06:28:25,083 --> 06:28:29,166
- Changes I wanna make.
- I think it's too late for changes.

2988
06:28:30,709 --> 06:28:32,792
I promised myself
I wasn't going to say anything.

2989
06:28:32,917 --> 06:28:36,333
You're too late.

2990
06:28:40,750 --> 06:28:43,125
What really happened
with Pentangeli?

2991
06:28:49,417 --> 06:28:51,458
His brother came, helped him.

2992
06:28:51,542 --> 06:28:54,500
I didn't even know
he had a brother.

2993
06:28:54,583 --> 06:28:56,500
Where is he now?

2994
06:28:57,709 --> 06:29:00,125
He's on a plane back to Sicily.

2995
06:29:00,875 --> 06:29:03,333
All he had to do
was show his face.

2996
06:29:05,250 --> 06:29:09,834
It was between the brothers.
I had nothing to do with it.

2997
06:29:18,000 --> 06:29:23,125
Nobody is going--
not you, not the kids! You hear me?

2998
06:29:23,208 --> 06:29:26,917
You're my wife, they're my children.
I love you. I won't allow it.

2999
06:29:28,000 --> 06:29:31,875
You say you love me, then you
talk about allowing me to leave!

3000
06:29:32,000 --> 06:29:35,041
Things have been going on for years
between men and women...

3001
06:29:35,166 --> 06:29:37,041
- that will not change.
- You've become blind!

3002
06:29:37,166 --> 06:29:40,083
- Blind to what?
- Look what happened to us.

3003
06:29:40,166 --> 06:29:43,208
- Look what's happened to our son!
- Nothing's happened--

3004
06:29:43,333 --> 06:29:46,500
- Anthony is fine!
- Anthony is not fine!

3005
06:29:46,625 --> 06:29:48,542
- I don't wanna hear about it!
- You will!

3006
06:29:48,625 --> 06:29:51,166
Anthony's not fine!

3007
06:29:51,291 --> 06:29:52,917
I don't wanna hear about it!

3008
06:29:53,792 --> 06:29:55,375
Over!

3009
06:30:08,500 --> 06:30:11,375
At this moment,
I feel no love for you at all.

3010
06:30:13,083 --> 06:30:15,458
I never thought
that would ever happen...

3011
06:30:16,750 --> 06:30:18,291
but it has.

3012
06:30:37,458 --> 06:30:39,125
We're gonna leave tomorrow.

3013
06:30:40,208 --> 06:30:43,166
Okay? Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

3014
06:30:43,250 --> 06:30:45,166
You haven't heard me.

3015
06:30:46,709 --> 06:30:49,458
What do you want from me?

3016
06:30:49,583 --> 06:30:51,667
Do you expect me to let you go?

3017
06:30:51,750 --> 06:30:55,583
Do you expect me to let you take
my children from me?

3018
06:30:56,667 --> 06:30:59,709
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

3019
06:30:59,792 --> 06:31:01,834
That that could never happen?

3020
06:31:01,959 --> 06:31:05,959
That I'd use all my power to keep
something like that from happening?

3021
06:31:06,875 --> 06:31:09,166
Don't you know that?

3022
06:31:15,959 --> 06:31:18,792
Now, in time...

3023
06:31:18,917 --> 06:31:20,375
you'll feel differently.

3024
06:31:22,083 --> 06:31:24,709
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

3025
06:31:26,875 --> 06:31:28,834
I know that.

3026
06:31:31,000 --> 06:31:33,917
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

3027
06:31:36,125 --> 06:31:38,250
Yes.

3028
06:31:38,333 --> 06:31:40,750
I know what that meant to you.

3029
06:31:43,333 --> 06:31:46,250
I'll make it up to you.

3030
06:31:46,375 --> 06:31:48,250
I swear, I'll make it up to you.

3031
06:31:50,458 --> 06:31:52,375
I'm gonna change.

3032
06:31:53,583 --> 06:31:55,333
I'll change.

3033
06:31:55,417 --> 06:31:57,917
I've learned that I have
the strength to change.

3034
06:32:00,291 --> 06:32:02,667
And you'll forget about
this miscarriage...

3035
06:32:04,125 --> 06:32:05,667
and we'll have another child...

3036
06:32:05,792 --> 06:32:08,583
and we'll go on--
you and I.

3037
06:32:10,166 --> 06:32:12,041
We'll go on.

3038
06:32:15,709 --> 06:32:17,792
You are blind.

3039
06:32:19,500 --> 06:32:21,875
It wasn't a miscarriage.

3040
06:32:23,917 --> 06:32:25,500
It was an abortion.

3041
06:32:27,250 --> 06:32:29,166
An abortion.

3042
06:32:30,083 --> 06:32:32,542
Just like our marriage
is an abortion.

3043
06:32:33,458 --> 06:32:36,583
Something that's unholy and evil.

3044
06:32:38,458 --> 06:32:41,583
I didn't want your son!

3045
06:32:41,667 --> 06:32:46,041
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

3046
06:32:47,417 --> 06:32:49,875
It was an abortion!

3047
06:32:50,000 --> 06:32:52,834
It was a son! A son!
And I had it killed...

3048
06:32:52,917 --> 06:32:55,709
because this must all end!

3049
06:32:57,333 --> 06:33:01,375
I know now that it's over.
I knew it then.

3050
06:33:02,709 --> 06:33:05,083
There would be no way...

3051
06:33:05,166 --> 06:33:08,125
no way you could ever forgive me...

3052
06:33:08,250 --> 06:33:10,625
not with this Sicilian thing...

3053
06:33:10,709 --> 06:33:12,959
that's been going on
for 2,000 years--

3054
06:33:13,041 --> 06:33:14,959
Bitch!

3055
06:33:20,667 --> 06:33:23,917
- You won't take my children.
- I will.

3056
06:33:24,041 --> 06:33:27,917
- You won't take my children!
- They're my children too.

3057
06:34:40,375 --> 06:34:42,458
Can I speak with you
for a second?

3058
06:34:51,291 --> 06:34:55,333
- Where's Mike?
- Waiting for you to leave.

3059
06:34:58,959 --> 06:35:00,834
Can I talk with him?

3060
06:35:00,959 --> 06:35:02,834
Sorry, no chance.

3061
06:35:03,834 --> 06:35:06,709
- Can I see him?
- He's in the boathouse.

3062
06:35:20,375 --> 06:35:22,250
Michael, it's Connie.

3063
06:35:48,542 --> 06:35:51,083
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

3064
06:36:00,417 --> 06:36:02,417
Is Kay coming?

3065
06:36:15,041 --> 06:36:17,959
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

3066
06:36:18,041 --> 06:36:21,959
He asked for you,
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

3067
06:36:25,333 --> 06:36:27,250
That's right.

3068
06:36:29,834 --> 06:36:33,250
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

3069
06:36:37,542 --> 06:36:39,583
Please, I wanna talk to you.

3070
06:36:51,500 --> 06:36:54,959
I hated you for so many years.

3071
06:36:55,083 --> 06:36:59,083
I think that I did things to myself,
to hurt myself...

3072
06:36:59,208 --> 06:37:01,083
so that you'd know...

3073
06:37:04,166 --> 06:37:06,083
that I could hurt you.

3074
06:37:12,500 --> 06:37:16,583
You were just being strong
for all of us the way Papa was.

3075
06:37:17,500 --> 06:37:19,417
And I forgive you.

3076
06:37:23,792 --> 06:37:26,750
Can't you forgive Fredo?

3077
06:37:26,875 --> 06:37:31,750
He's so sweet
and helpless without you.

3078
06:37:37,959 --> 06:37:41,458
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.

3079
06:39:36,875 --> 06:39:38,291
Sit down.

3080
06:39:49,667 --> 06:39:52,834
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

3081
06:39:54,709 --> 06:39:56,917
You hear about it?

3082
06:39:57,000 --> 06:39:58,917
I hear that he's in Israel.

3083
06:40:00,000 --> 06:40:02,417
And the High Court in Israel
turned down his request...

3084
06:40:02,500 --> 06:40:04,709
to live there as a returned Jew.

3085
06:40:04,834 --> 06:40:08,792
His passport's been invalidated,
except for return to the US.

3086
06:40:08,875 --> 06:40:11,375
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

3087
06:40:11,500 --> 06:40:14,458
He offered a gift of a million
dollars if they let him live there.

3088
06:40:16,417 --> 06:40:18,291
They turned him down.

3089
06:40:18,417 --> 06:40:22,667
- He's gonna try Panama.
- Panama won't take him.

3090
06:40:22,750 --> 06:40:25,250
Not for a million,
not for ten million.

3091
06:40:25,375 --> 06:40:27,291
His medical condition
is reported as terminal.

3092
06:40:27,375 --> 06:40:30,291
He's only gonna live
another six months anyway.

3093
06:40:30,417 --> 06:40:33,458
He's been dying of
the same heart attack for 20 years.

3094
06:40:33,583 --> 06:40:38,750
- That plane goes to Miami.
- Right. That's where I want it met.

3095
06:40:38,834 --> 06:40:42,041
Mike, that's impossible.
They'll turn him over directly...

3096
06:40:42,166 --> 06:40:44,333
to the lnternal Revenue, Customs
and half the FBl.

3097
06:40:44,458 --> 06:40:47,709
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

3098
06:40:47,792 --> 06:40:50,166
It would be like trying to kill
the president. No way to get to him.

3099
06:40:51,500 --> 06:40:53,417
You know, you surprise me.

3100
06:40:56,583 --> 06:41:00,250
If anything in this life
is certain--

3101
06:41:00,375 --> 06:41:02,625
if history's taught us anything...

3102
06:41:03,542 --> 06:41:06,166
it's that you can kill anyone.

3103
06:41:13,542 --> 06:41:16,542
Difficult, not impossible.

3104
06:41:16,667 --> 06:41:18,917
Good.

3105
06:41:21,166 --> 06:41:24,375
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?

3106
06:41:28,000 --> 06:41:32,000
I thought you were
gonna tell me that...

3107
06:41:32,125 --> 06:41:34,000
you were moving
your family to Vegas.

3108
06:41:35,792 --> 06:41:41,417
And that you'd been offered the
vice presidency of the hotels there.

3109
06:41:41,500 --> 06:41:43,542
- I thought you'd tell me that.
- I turned them down.

3110
06:41:43,667 --> 06:41:45,375
Do I have to tell you
about every offer that I turn down?

3111
06:41:50,583 --> 06:41:51,709
Let's do business.

3112
06:41:51,834 --> 06:41:54,208
All right.

3113
06:41:55,250 --> 06:41:57,333
Just consider this.
Just consider it.

3114
06:41:59,417 --> 06:42:01,041
Now, Roth and the Rosatos
are on the run.

3115
06:42:01,166 --> 06:42:04,125
Are they worth it,
and are they strong enough?

3116
06:42:04,250 --> 06:42:08,083
Is it worth it?
I mean, you won.

3117
06:42:08,166 --> 06:42:10,083
Do you want to wipe
everybody out?

3118
06:42:10,166 --> 06:42:13,166
I don't feel I have to wipe
everybody out--

3119
06:42:13,250 --> 06:42:16,375
just my enemies, that's all.

3120
06:42:22,625 --> 06:42:25,333
You gonna come along with me on
these things I have to do or what?

3121
06:42:27,750 --> 06:42:32,250
'Cause if not, you can take your
wife, family and your mistress...

3122
06:42:32,375 --> 06:42:34,750
move them all to Las Vegas.

3123
06:42:39,458 --> 06:42:44,291
Why do you hurt me? I've always been
loyal to you. I mean, what is this?

3124
06:42:58,041 --> 06:42:59,959
What is it that you want me to do?

3125
06:43:03,291 --> 06:43:07,375
How would you like it if I taught
you how to catch really big fish?

3126
06:43:07,458 --> 06:43:10,250
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

3127
06:43:10,375 --> 06:43:13,250
You know, when I was your age...

3128
06:43:13,333 --> 06:43:16,750
I went out fishing
with all my brothers...

3129
06:43:16,834 --> 06:43:19,250
and my father...

3130
06:43:19,333 --> 06:43:21,375
everybody...

3131
06:43:21,500 --> 06:43:24,375
and I was the only one
that caught a fish.

3132
06:43:25,834 --> 06:43:28,208
Nobody else could catch one,
except me.

3133
06:43:28,333 --> 06:43:30,208
You know how I did it?

3134
06:43:31,750 --> 06:43:35,375
Every time I put the line
in the water, I said a Hail Mary.

3135
06:43:35,458 --> 06:43:38,375
And every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

3136
06:43:41,750 --> 06:43:44,166
You believe that?
It's true.

3137
06:43:44,291 --> 06:43:46,166
That's the secret.

3138
06:43:47,792 --> 06:43:50,625
Wanna try it
when we go on the lake?

3139
06:43:50,709 --> 06:43:54,834
Okay.
What else you got?

3140
06:44:21,458 --> 06:44:24,000
Things are gonna be okay, Frankie.
Don't worry.

3141
06:44:24,125 --> 06:44:28,041
- Did my brother go back?
- Yeah. Don't worry.

3142
06:44:28,166 --> 06:44:31,208
He's ten times tougher than me--
my brother.

3143
06:44:31,333 --> 06:44:34,166
He's old-fashioned.

3144
06:44:34,250 --> 06:44:37,417
He didn't wanna go out to dinner.
He just wanted to go straight home.

3145
06:44:37,542 --> 06:44:39,458
That's my brother.
There's nothing...

3146
06:44:39,542 --> 06:44:42,625
that could get him away
from that two-meal town.

3147
06:44:42,750 --> 06:44:45,625
He could've been big here,
could've had his own family.

3148
06:44:54,458 --> 06:44:56,333
What do I do now?

3149
06:45:04,500 --> 06:45:07,375
You were always interested
in politics and history.

3150
06:45:10,000 --> 06:45:13,375
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

3151
06:45:13,500 --> 06:45:16,875
I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

3152
06:45:19,792 --> 06:45:22,208
You were around the old-timers...

3153
06:45:22,291 --> 06:45:25,500
agreeing about how the family's
should be organized...

3154
06:45:25,625 --> 06:45:28,583
based on the old home allegiance
and called them regimes--

3155
06:45:28,709 --> 06:45:31,125
capos and soldiers.

3156
06:45:32,291 --> 06:45:34,208
And it worked.

3157
06:45:34,333 --> 06:45:36,834
Yeah, it worked.

3158
06:45:36,959 --> 06:45:40,583
Those were the great old days,
you know?

3159
06:45:40,709 --> 06:45:43,750
And we was like the Roman Empire.

3160
06:45:43,875 --> 06:45:47,250
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

3161
06:45:51,792 --> 06:45:53,709
It was once.

3162
06:46:10,834 --> 06:46:15,458
When a plot
against the emperor failed...

3163
06:46:15,542 --> 06:46:18,166
the plotters were always given
a chance...

3164
06:46:20,959 --> 06:46:23,375
to let the families
keep their fortunes.

3165
06:46:24,458 --> 06:46:26,667
Yeah, but only the rich guys.

3166
06:46:26,750 --> 06:46:28,959
The little guys,
they got knocked off...

3167
06:46:29,083 --> 06:46:31,792
and all their estates
went to the emperors...

3168
06:46:31,917 --> 06:46:34,875
unless they went home
and killed themselves.

3169
06:46:34,959 --> 06:46:36,875
Then nothing happened to them.

3170
06:46:38,333 --> 06:46:42,250
And their families
were taken care of.

3171
06:46:44,375 --> 06:46:48,125
That was a good break.
Nice deal.

3172
06:46:48,208 --> 06:46:49,625
Yeah.

3173
06:46:50,709 --> 06:46:52,625
They went home...

3174
06:46:54,000 --> 06:46:57,125
and sat in a hot bath...

3175
06:46:57,250 --> 06:46:59,709
opened up their veins...

3176
06:46:59,834 --> 06:47:02,250
and bled to death.

3177
06:47:03,792 --> 06:47:06,709
And sometimes they had
a little party before they did it.

3178
06:47:13,166 --> 06:47:15,792
Don't worry about anything.

3179
06:47:16,834 --> 06:47:19,750
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

3180
06:47:38,458 --> 06:47:40,041
See you, Tom.

3181
06:47:53,667 --> 06:47:56,333
You have to go.

3182
06:47:57,542 --> 06:48:00,417
- So pretty.
- Please hurry. He's coming.

3183
06:48:02,917 --> 06:48:05,792
Go rest.

3184
06:48:12,041 --> 06:48:13,959
Kiss Mama good-bye.

3185
06:48:16,709 --> 06:48:18,792
Will you kiss your mother good-bye?

3186
06:48:18,917 --> 06:48:20,834
Say good-bye to Mama.

3187
06:48:22,291 --> 06:48:24,166
I love you.

3188
06:48:26,000 --> 06:48:27,375
Please.

3189
06:48:46,375 --> 06:48:47,917
Come here.

3190
06:48:57,709 --> 06:48:59,792
Please, kiss me once.

3191
06:50:39,500 --> 06:50:41,667
Easy.

3192
06:50:50,417 --> 06:50:53,166
He's here!
We're going fishing!

3193
06:50:53,250 --> 06:50:55,917
Michael wants to take him
to Reno now!

3194
06:50:56,041 --> 06:50:58,083
Oh, shit.

3195
06:51:00,208 --> 06:51:03,125
Okay, kid, you gotta go to Reno
with your pop.

3196
06:51:04,625 --> 06:51:07,458
Come on, I'll take you
fishing tomorrow, okay?

3197
06:51:07,542 --> 06:51:08,959
Okay.

3198
06:51:11,375 --> 06:51:13,834
Attaboy.
Hey, Anthony.

3199
06:51:13,959 --> 06:51:18,417
Listen. I'll catch one for you
in secret, huh? All right?

3200
06:51:18,542 --> 06:51:20,417
Okay, go ahead.

3201
06:51:21,375 --> 06:51:22,417
Okay, let's go.

3202
06:52:02,709 --> 06:52:05,083
Mr. Roth, you understand
I'll have to take you into custody?

3203
06:52:05,208 --> 06:52:07,125
Yes, I understand.

3204
06:52:07,208 --> 06:52:10,125
Can you give us your reaction to
the High Court of Israel's ruling?

3205
06:52:10,250 --> 06:52:13,208
I'm a retired investor
on a pension.

3206
06:52:13,333 --> 06:52:16,667
I went to Israel because I wished
to live there as Jew...

3207
06:52:16,792 --> 06:52:18,333
in the twilight of my life.

3208
06:52:24,750 --> 06:52:27,667
Hey, Frankie, come on out!
Let's play some hearts!

3209
06:52:53,834 --> 06:52:56,667
Is it true you're worth
over $300 million, Mr. Roth?

3210
06:52:56,792 --> 06:53:00,709
I'm a retired investor
living on a pension.

3211
06:53:00,792 --> 06:53:04,500
I came home to vote
in the presidential election...

3212
06:53:04,583 --> 06:53:07,750
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

3213
06:53:20,291 --> 06:53:22,750
Jesus Christ.

3214
06:53:22,834 --> 06:53:27,000
Hail Mary, full of grace...

3215
06:53:27,125 --> 06:53:29,834
the Lord is with thee.

3216
06:53:29,959 --> 06:53:33,250
Blessed are thou amongst women.

3217
06:53:33,375 --> 06:53:36,250
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

3218
06:53:37,917 --> 06:53:41,625
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

3219
06:54:23,625 --> 06:54:27,375
Hey, everybody,
come on, pay attention. Come here.

3220
06:54:27,500 --> 06:54:30,625
This is my friend, Carlo Rizzi.
My brother, Fredo.

3221
06:54:30,709 --> 06:54:32,458
- You know Fredo.
- Sure.

3222
06:54:32,542 --> 06:54:37,291
Here's my stepbrother, Tom.
That's his girl, Theresa.

3223
06:54:37,375 --> 06:54:40,583
This cute little thing over here's
my sister Connie I told you about.

3224
06:54:40,709 --> 06:54:43,500
Come on, say hello to Carlo.
He's good-looking, ain't he?

3225
06:54:43,583 --> 06:54:45,375
Yes.

3226
06:54:45,500 --> 06:54:48,083
Oh, that droopy thing over there,
that's my brother, Mike.

3227
06:54:48,208 --> 06:54:50,917
We call him Joe Collar, you know
what I mean? Go on, sit down.

3228
06:54:51,041 --> 06:54:54,250
- Go ahead. Talk to each other.
- Sit down.

3229
06:54:54,375 --> 06:54:56,291
Hey, Mr. Einstein.

3230
06:54:59,583 --> 06:55:02,500
- Here's the cake.
- Hey, get in here.

3231
06:55:05,166 --> 06:55:08,041
- Where's your father?
- On a wild goose chase.

3232
06:55:08,166 --> 06:55:10,542
- Here.
- Let's see that thing.

3233
06:55:11,917 --> 06:55:14,583
- Oh, honey, that's nice.
- That's beautiful.

3234
06:55:14,709 --> 06:55:17,208
- Should I put the candles on now?
- Go on. You help her, all right?

3235
06:55:17,333 --> 06:55:18,750
Sure.

3236
06:55:19,917 --> 06:55:22,500
- What is that, rum?
- Yeah.

3237
06:55:28,125 --> 06:55:31,458
Sonny, come on, don't touch
the antipasto till Pop sees it.

3238
06:55:39,458 --> 06:55:42,959
What do you think, the nerve of them
Japs, them slanty-eyed bastards?

3239
06:55:43,041 --> 06:55:45,375
Dropping bombs on our own backyard.
On Pop's birthday, you know?

3240
06:55:45,458 --> 06:55:48,875
They didn't know
it was Pop's birthday.

3241
06:55:49,000 --> 06:55:51,709
Well, we should've expected it
after the oil embargo.

3242
06:55:51,834 --> 06:55:54,458
What do you mean, expected it?
They got no right dropping bombs.

3243
06:55:54,583 --> 06:55:56,709
What are you, a Jap lover?
You on their side?

3244
06:55:56,834 --> 06:55:58,792
I understand 30,000 men enlisted
this morning.

3245
06:55:58,917 --> 06:56:01,583
- Bunch of saps.
- Why are they saps?

3246
06:56:01,667 --> 06:56:04,041
Come on, do we even have to talk
about the war?

3247
06:56:04,125 --> 06:56:05,917
You talk to Carlo, all right?

3248
06:56:08,208 --> 06:56:12,250
They're saps because
they risk their lives for strangers.

3249
06:56:12,333 --> 06:56:16,166
- That's Pop talking.
- You're goddamn right.

3250
06:56:16,250 --> 06:56:17,792
They risk their lives
for their country.

3251
06:56:17,875 --> 06:56:19,583
Country ain't your blood.
You remember that.

3252
06:56:19,709 --> 06:56:21,917
- I don't feel that way.
- "I don't feel that way."

3253
06:56:22,041 --> 06:56:25,500
If you don't feel like that,
quit college and join the army.

3254
06:56:25,583 --> 06:56:27,083
I did.

3255
06:56:28,208 --> 06:56:29,917
I enlisted in the Marines.

3256
06:56:33,625 --> 06:56:36,834
- Mike, why didn't you come to us?
- What do you mean?

3257
06:56:36,959 --> 06:56:40,125
Pop had to pull a lot of strings
to get you a deferment.

3258
06:56:40,208 --> 06:56:41,291
I didn't ask for it.

3259
06:56:41,375 --> 06:56:43,500
I didn't ask for a deferment.
I didn't want it.

3260
06:56:45,250 --> 06:56:47,750
Come on, knock it off! Come on!

3261
06:56:47,834 --> 06:56:49,834
Punk.

3262
06:56:49,959 --> 06:56:51,625
- Go on.
- Sit down.

3263
06:56:54,500 --> 06:56:57,709
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

3264
06:57:01,458 --> 06:57:03,375
Go show Carlo the tree.

3265
06:57:14,041 --> 06:57:15,458
Nice.

3266
06:57:20,000 --> 06:57:22,917
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

3267
06:57:23,709 --> 06:57:26,375
That's swell. Congratulations.

3268
06:57:26,500 --> 06:57:30,166
That's right, encourage him.
Go on, get me a drink.

3269
06:57:31,041 --> 06:57:33,208
Go on.

3270
06:57:35,750 --> 06:57:38,875
I don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.

3271
06:57:38,959 --> 06:57:43,125
Many times, he and I have talked
about your future.

3272
06:57:45,041 --> 06:57:46,792
You talked to my father
about my future?

3273
06:57:50,125 --> 06:57:54,041
- My future?
- He has high hopes for you.

3274
06:57:54,166 --> 06:57:56,291
I have my own plans
for my future.

3275
06:57:57,208 --> 06:57:59,875
Did you go to college to get stupid?
You're really stupid.

3276
06:58:00,000 --> 06:58:01,875
He's here, come on!

3277
06:58:04,208 --> 06:58:06,417
Come on.

3278
06:58:08,333 --> 06:58:09,750
Stupid.

3279
06:58:26,750 --> 06:58:30,417
Surprise!

3280
06:58:30,542 --> 06:58:34,792
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

3281
06:58:34,875 --> 06:58:38,458
For he's a jolly good fellow

3282
06:58:38,583 --> 06:58:40,667
Which nobody can deny

3283
06:59:50,161 --> 06:59:52,079
<i>My dear children.</i>

3284
06:59:52,705 --> 06:59:57,167
<i>It is now better than several years
since I moved to New York</i>

3285
06:59:57,919 --> 07:00:01,213
<i>and I haven't seen you
as much as I would like to.</i>

3286
07:00:02,340 --> 07:00:06,343
<i>I hope you will come to this
ceremony of Papal honors,</i>

3287
07:00:06,428 --> 07:00:08,846
<i>given for my charitable work.</i>

3288
07:00:11,099 --> 07:00:14,268
<i>The only wealth
in this world is children.</i>

3289
07:00:14,352 --> 07:00:17,271
<i>More than all the money
and power on earth,</i>

3290
07:00:18,523 --> 07:00:20,858
<i>you are my treasure.</i>

3291
07:00:22,360 --> 07:00:24,653
<i>Anthony and Mary,</i>

3292
07:00:24,779 --> 07:00:29,700
<i>although I entrusted your education to
your mother for your own best interest,</i>

3293
07:00:29,784 --> 07:00:34,872
<i>I look forward to seeing you, and to
a new period of harmony in our lives.</i>

3294
07:00:37,041 --> 07:00:41,587
<i>Perhaps you might prevail upon your
mother to come to this celebration,</i>

3295
07:00:42,213 --> 07:00:46,967
<i>and that from time to time, we can all
see each other at family functions.</i>

3296
07:00:48,428 --> 07:00:52,764
<i>Anyway, I remain your loving father.</i>

3297
07:01:22,629 --> 07:01:25,255
Hail Mary, full of grace...

3298
07:01:28,843 --> 07:01:31,428
...blessed art Thou amongst women...

3299
07:01:32,180 --> 07:01:35,349
...and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb, Jesus.

3300
07:01:36,601 --> 07:01:40,979
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

3301
07:02:05,964 --> 07:02:12,010
Almighty God, bless the insignia
of Saint Sebastian the martyr,

3302
07:02:12,136 --> 07:02:17,933
that it may contribute to the sacredness
of him to whom it is given.

3303
07:02:30,530 --> 07:02:34,074
Do you, Michael, promise to be faithful

3304
07:02:34,158 --> 07:02:36,785
to the noble purposes of this Order,

3305
07:02:37,495 --> 07:02:42,374
to have a special care for the poor,
the needy and those who are ill?

3306
07:02:42,458 --> 07:02:44,334
I do so promise.

3307
07:02:59,767 --> 07:03:02,686
May the blessing of Almighty God,

3308
07:03:02,770 --> 07:03:07,816
Father, Son and Holy Spirit

3309
07:03:07,900 --> 07:03:12,946
descend upon you
and remain with you forever.

3310
07:04:47,041 --> 07:04:49,751
Vincent, our name is not on the list.

3311
07:04:52,296 --> 07:04:56,383
Write it in. Mancini. M-A-N-C-I-N-I.

3312
07:04:58,094 --> 07:05:00,429
- Problem?
- My name isn't on the list.

3313
07:05:00,513 --> 07:05:05,308
- Then you have to leave immediately.
- You want to dance with me?

3314
07:05:05,393 --> 07:05:08,603
Joe, it's Vinnie. These are our guests.

3315
07:05:08,688 --> 07:05:10,731
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.

3316
07:05:10,815 --> 07:05:13,108
Welcome to the party.

3317
07:06:06,120 --> 07:06:10,457
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you. This is my husband.

3318
07:06:10,541 --> 07:06:12,751
- Sit down.
- My son, Anthony.

3319
07:06:14,045 --> 07:06:19,174
The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of
the highest honors the Church awards.

3320
07:06:19,258 --> 07:06:21,593
It was first granted by Pope...

3321
07:06:21,719 --> 07:06:25,055
What about Mr. Corleone's connections
with gambling?

3322
07:06:25,515 --> 07:06:27,182
The press kits have...

3323
07:06:27,266 --> 07:06:29,559
What about his involvement
with the underworld?

3324
07:06:29,644 --> 07:06:30,811
Cut the crap.

3325
07:06:31,813 --> 07:06:34,564
The Pope, the Holy Father himself,

3326
07:06:34,649 --> 07:06:39,319
has today blessed Michael Corleone.
Do you know better than the Pope?

3327
07:06:40,112 --> 07:06:43,323
Vincent! She loves you.

3328
07:06:43,407 --> 07:06:45,075
Yeah?

3329
07:06:49,121 --> 07:06:50,747
I love you too.

3330
07:06:56,629 --> 07:06:59,589
Hi, Vincent. I remember you.

3331
07:07:01,425 --> 07:07:05,470
- From where?
- The last party we were at together.

3332
07:07:05,555 --> 07:07:08,682
- Did you come to the club?
- No, it was a wedding.

3333
07:07:11,185 --> 07:07:13,645
I was eight and you were 15.

3334
07:07:14,814 --> 07:07:17,774
I had many girlfriends when I was 15.

3335
07:07:17,859 --> 07:07:19,985
- Eight-year-olds?
- Especially them.

3336
07:07:22,446 --> 07:07:24,531
Where's Mary?

3337
07:07:24,615 --> 07:07:29,578
Would somebody please hail Mary?
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

3338
07:07:29,662 --> 07:07:33,665
You haven't kissed me hello yet.
Relatives always kiss.

3339
07:07:34,333 --> 07:07:37,377
- Now we're related?
- I'm your little cousin.

3340
07:07:45,261 --> 07:07:48,305
- Who's your father?
- I'll give you a hint.

3341
07:07:49,599 --> 07:07:51,308
He's Italian.

3342
07:07:51,392 --> 07:07:54,728
Mary, we've been waiting for you.

3343
07:07:54,812 --> 07:07:59,065
Remember to keep your voice low.

3344
07:07:59,150 --> 07:08:01,651
And smile. Don't forget to smile.

3345
07:08:21,964 --> 07:08:26,217
The honorary chairman of
the Vito Corleone Foundation,

3346
07:08:26,302 --> 07:08:28,511
my daughter, Mary Corleone.

3347
07:08:38,397 --> 07:08:39,731
Thanks.

3348
07:08:41,275 --> 07:08:46,029
I think I inherited my father's love
for speechmaking. Here it goes.

3349
07:08:47,740 --> 07:08:52,327
The Vito Corleone Foundation helps
the poor in every country,

3350
07:08:52,411 --> 07:08:56,498
gives grants to artists,
funds medical research,

3351
07:08:56,582 --> 07:09:01,419
and is particularly dedicated
to the resurrection of Sicily.

3352
07:09:02,129 --> 07:09:04,255
Archbishop Gilday,

3353
07:09:04,382 --> 07:09:10,720
here is 100 million dollars for the poor
of Sicily, in the name of Vito Corleone.

3354
07:09:11,347 --> 07:09:13,723
Don't spend it all in one place.

3355
07:09:31,659 --> 07:09:36,871
Mary, I'm so proud of you.

3356
07:09:43,921 --> 07:09:45,630
Michael...

3357
07:09:45,715 --> 07:09:48,550
You've done a wonderful thing for Sicily.

3358
07:09:49,427 --> 07:09:53,054
Let's hope that the money gets
to the people who need it.

3359
07:09:53,139 --> 07:09:54,431
Amen.

3360
07:09:54,515 --> 07:09:59,644
...the most important part:
Johnny Fontane!

3361
07:10:08,446 --> 07:10:11,406
Thank you very much.
I'm happy to be here.

3362
07:10:11,490 --> 07:10:17,162
I would like you to join me in honoring
Commendatore Michael Corleone.

3363
07:10:21,459 --> 07:10:24,794
I have something special
for our godfather.

3364
07:10:24,879 --> 07:10:29,424
I happen to know his favorite song.
Michael, where are you going?

3365
07:10:29,508 --> 07:10:33,219
I'm off to the kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

3366
07:10:34,513 --> 07:10:37,057
Your favorite song, "Salsiccia's Own".

3367
07:10:37,141 --> 07:10:40,226
I'm having a salsiccia sandwich.
I'll be back.

3368
07:11:14,804 --> 07:11:16,262
Hello, Kay.

3369
07:11:26,649 --> 07:11:29,526
Congratulations, Michael.
That's quite an honor.

3370
07:11:29,610 --> 07:11:32,612
But a little expensive, wouldn't you say?

3371
07:11:35,491 --> 07:11:38,451
- Cake?
- No, thank you.

3372
07:11:52,383 --> 07:11:55,635
- It's been a long time, hasn't it?
- Yeah.

3373
07:11:55,719 --> 07:11:57,679
- Eight years.
- Yeah.

3374
07:11:58,514 --> 07:12:00,306
You look wonderful.

3375
07:12:03,936 --> 07:12:08,565
Your son has something he wants to
talk to you about. I came here for him.

3376
07:12:43,392 --> 07:12:48,771
- What's wrong with being a lawyer?
- He wants his life to be in music.

3377
07:12:50,649 --> 07:12:54,986
Music is great, I love music.
But he should finish what he started.

3378
07:12:55,070 --> 07:12:56,446
Anthony...

3379
07:12:57,072 --> 07:12:59,490
- I'm going my own way.
- Your own way?

3380
07:13:00,492 --> 07:13:02,327
- Professional singer?
- Yes.

3381
07:13:02,411 --> 07:13:05,538
What happens if you fail?

3382
07:13:05,623 --> 07:13:08,833
- I won't fail.
- Men always believe that.

3383
07:13:08,918 --> 07:13:13,129
A law degree is like taking
out insurance.

3384
07:13:13,964 --> 07:13:17,842
- After that you can work for me...
- I will never work for you.

3385
07:13:19,136 --> 07:13:20,970
I have bad memories.

3386
07:13:22,765 --> 07:13:25,225
Every family has bad memories.

3387
07:13:28,979 --> 07:13:33,524
I'll always be your son, but won't have
anything to do with your business.

3388
07:13:36,111 --> 07:13:39,530
Anthony... finish the law degree.

3389
07:13:41,116 --> 07:13:42,242
No.

3390
07:13:59,760 --> 07:14:03,638
Well, that he got from you. That "no".

3391
07:14:06,684 --> 07:14:11,771
- You could've helped me convince him.
- Convince him of what?

3392
07:14:12,439 --> 07:14:13,731
Of what?

3393
07:14:14,566 --> 07:14:19,195
He throws his life away.
He throws greatness away.

3394
07:14:20,322 --> 07:14:22,031
This is greatness?

3395
07:14:23,534 --> 07:14:27,996
Now that you're so respectable,
you're more dangerous than ever.

3396
07:14:28,080 --> 07:14:32,208
I preferred you when you were
just a common Mafia hood.

3397
07:14:33,377 --> 07:14:34,627
Okay.

3398
07:14:35,921 --> 07:14:39,340
- Can we talk common sense here?
- All right.

3399
07:14:46,098 --> 07:14:48,558
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

3400
07:14:55,316 --> 07:14:58,651
- What did you come here for?
- To protect my son.

3401
07:14:58,777 --> 07:15:03,698
Not to see you disguised by your
church. That was a shameful ceremony.

3402
07:15:08,412 --> 07:15:10,955
I spent my life protecting my son.

3403
07:15:11,540 --> 07:15:15,043
I spent my life protecting my family!

3404
07:15:15,127 --> 07:15:17,253
Let's be reasonable, okay?

3405
07:15:18,464 --> 07:15:22,842
That's your big thing, isn't it, Michael?
Reason,

3406
07:15:23,886 --> 07:15:27,347
- backed up by murder.
- Oh, God.

3407
07:15:29,141 --> 07:15:32,560
- You hate me. You hate me.
- No.

3408
07:15:32,644 --> 07:15:34,479
I don't hate you.

3409
07:15:36,273 --> 07:15:37,899
I dread you.

3410
07:15:41,820 --> 07:15:47,950
I did what I could, Kay, to protect all
of you from the horrors of this world.

3411
07:15:49,370 --> 07:15:51,537
But you became my horror.

3412
07:16:01,256 --> 07:16:04,717
The children still love you, though.
Especially Mary.

3413
07:16:07,846 --> 07:16:09,555
That's something.

3414
07:16:11,975 --> 07:16:15,478
We can build on that. For their sake,

3415
07:16:19,483 --> 07:16:20,817
let's try.

3416
07:16:21,485 --> 07:16:26,823
Only if you let Tony go free to have
his own life, away from you.

3417
07:16:34,206 --> 07:16:35,915
I'll let Tony go.

3418
07:16:38,502 --> 07:16:40,002
Thank you.

3419
07:17:14,705 --> 07:17:16,747
- Hi.
- Hi.

3420
07:17:18,709 --> 07:17:24,005
You could hurt somebody with those.
Let me show you around.

3421
07:17:24,089 --> 07:17:26,466
Can you get me an interview
with Corleone?

3422
07:17:26,550 --> 07:17:30,803
No. I'm a relative, but I can't do that.
What else can I do for you?

3423
07:17:32,306 --> 07:17:35,183
- Handsome, but useless.
- Oh, yeah?

3424
07:17:35,267 --> 07:17:38,144
- That's okay, I'll gamble.
- Do you like to gamble?

3425
07:17:38,228 --> 07:17:42,023
Let's go to Atlantic City.
I'll show you how to gamble.

3426
07:17:42,149 --> 07:17:46,944
- How do I know what numbers to bet?
- Do I look like a guy who's gonna lose?

3427
07:17:47,029 --> 07:17:48,279
Well...

3428
07:17:50,908 --> 07:17:52,909
Spooky-looking guy there.

3429
07:17:52,993 --> 07:17:58,539
- What's a guy like that doing here?
- That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.

3430
07:17:58,624 --> 07:18:00,708
- You know him?
- Yeah, I do.

3431
07:18:01,668 --> 07:18:06,088
His name is Anthony Squigilaro.
They call him "The Ant".

3432
07:18:06,798 --> 07:18:09,217
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

3433
07:18:18,060 --> 07:18:19,644
Don Altobello.

3434
07:18:21,146 --> 07:18:24,565
<i>- I've come to pay my respects.
- Grazie.</i>

3435
07:18:28,111 --> 07:18:30,571
You honor my father's friendship.

3436
07:18:30,656 --> 07:18:32,740
Where is my goddaughter?

3437
07:18:34,660 --> 07:18:36,786
- Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

3438
07:18:37,371 --> 07:18:41,874
It was not so long ago
that I held you in these old hands.

3439
07:18:50,384 --> 07:18:55,555
Michael, I've lost all the venom,
all the juice of youth.

3440
07:18:55,639 --> 07:19:00,851
I've lost the lust for women,
and now my mind is clear.

3441
07:19:01,478 --> 07:19:07,942
My duty to God is clear.
I have a special favor to ask of you.

3442
07:19:09,528 --> 07:19:16,409
Can I attach my name
to the Vito Corleone Foundation,

3443
07:19:17,035 --> 07:19:22,123
so that you and I can be joined
in name and spirit?

3444
07:19:24,668 --> 07:19:29,505
- One million dollars.
- A lot of money...

3445
07:19:32,301 --> 07:19:36,262
- Godfather.
- Don Altobello, you have such a heart.

3446
07:19:39,224 --> 07:19:43,519
Come, let's go and sample
some of that old vino.

3447
07:19:50,360 --> 07:19:53,821
The Vatican knows nothing
about these shareholders.

3448
07:19:53,905 --> 07:19:55,114
Good.

3449
07:19:55,198 --> 07:20:00,077
I have a tendency to worry. We've
increased our position substantially.

3450
07:20:00,203 --> 07:20:04,749
- Naturally, I worry.
- Stop worrying, we have an agreement.

3451
07:20:05,709 --> 07:20:08,669
Good. How do you think
I got this gray hair?

3452
07:20:08,754 --> 07:20:14,508
Two seconds... Thank you for your
contribution to the swimming-pool.

3453
07:20:14,593 --> 07:20:18,804
We need your help on Sam Wallace's
candidacy for judgeship.

3454
07:20:18,889 --> 07:20:21,515
- We can always use a goodjudge.
- Thanks.

3455
07:20:21,600 --> 07:20:23,267
Andrew!

3456
07:20:23,352 --> 07:20:27,271
My godson Andrew Hagen.
My brother Tom's eldest boy.

3457
07:20:27,356 --> 07:20:31,859
He's been assistant to Bishop Breelan
for three years.

3458
07:20:31,943 --> 07:20:36,280
- Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.
- Rome needs fine young priests.

3459
07:20:36,365 --> 07:20:39,408
His mother Teresa Hagen,
Bishop Gilday.

3460
07:20:40,410 --> 07:20:41,869
Honored to meet you.

3461
07:20:41,953 --> 07:20:44,955
Mr. Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamilton.

3462
07:20:46,291 --> 07:20:50,795
Vincent Mancini promised to tell you
about me. That maybe you'd see me.

3463
07:20:51,088 --> 07:20:54,215
- Did Vincent Mancini call about her?
- No.

3464
07:20:54,299 --> 07:20:58,803
- You promised to stay out there, twice.
- I know.

3465
07:20:59,805 --> 07:21:03,766
Joey Zasa showed up.
He's waiting in the lobby.

3466
07:21:03,850 --> 07:21:08,229
<i>He wants to personally
congratulate you. Show his respect.</i>

3467
07:21:08,313 --> 07:21:13,275
- Do I have to see him?
- He says you're his patron.

3468
07:21:16,446 --> 07:21:18,614
Hey, Vinnie!

3469
07:21:19,616 --> 07:21:22,284
- Who's your favorite aunt?
- You are.

3470
07:21:24,955 --> 07:21:28,457
Today I'll talk to Michael
about your little problem.

3471
07:21:29,292 --> 07:21:32,503
If you'd warned me, I would have
worn a better suit.

3472
07:21:34,047 --> 07:21:36,882
The Meucci Association has elected you

3473
07:21:36,967 --> 07:21:39,593
Italian-American Man of the Year.

3474
07:21:41,471 --> 07:21:42,847
Meucci...

3475
07:21:45,851 --> 07:21:47,351
Who's Meucci?

3476
07:21:48,603 --> 07:21:54,650
The Italian-American who invented
the telephone, one year before Bell.

3477
07:21:58,488 --> 07:22:01,449
And this is the reason
you've come today?

3478
07:22:08,749 --> 07:22:09,874
I...

3479
07:22:13,128 --> 07:22:15,546
I've got a stone in my shoe.

3480
07:22:16,965 --> 07:22:19,341
A two-bit punk who works for me.

3481
07:22:20,260 --> 07:22:23,596
The one who thinks he's related to you.

3482
07:22:26,057 --> 07:22:27,391
A bastard.

3483
07:22:31,354 --> 07:22:35,775
He's here. Vincent Mancini.
He's at the party.

3484
07:22:39,154 --> 07:22:40,654
Bring him in.

3485
07:22:42,032 --> 07:22:44,533
I think it's good that we talk.

3486
07:22:45,410 --> 07:22:47,369
<i>No, grazie.</i>

3487
07:22:49,372 --> 07:22:51,207
I have a problem...

3488
07:22:51,792 --> 07:22:58,047
...and I want to find out if it is
my problem or your problem.

3489
07:22:58,131 --> 07:23:03,219
Your business is your business. I have
no interests or percentages from it.

3490
07:23:04,679 --> 07:23:07,807
Good. Then it's my problem.

3491
07:23:12,145 --> 07:23:16,607
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini.
Sonny's boy.

3492
07:23:18,610 --> 07:23:21,695
- How are you, Mr. Corleone?
- How are you?

3493
07:23:21,780 --> 07:23:25,616
- Good. How are you? Good party.
- You like it?

3494
07:23:25,700 --> 07:23:28,911
- Yes, I had to sneak in.
- You're dressed for it.

3495
07:23:33,667 --> 07:23:37,586
So, what's the trouble
between you and Mr. Joe Zasa?

3496
07:23:39,840 --> 07:23:44,134
- Just trouble. I'll take care of it.
- That's foolish of you.

3497
07:23:44,219 --> 07:23:49,139
Foolish of me? It's a little foolish
of this guy, don't you think? Right?

3498
07:23:50,892 --> 07:23:54,103
- Right?
- Temper like his father...

3499
07:23:54,771 --> 07:23:56,105
Vincent...

3500
07:23:58,149 --> 07:24:03,779
Mr. Joe Zasa now owns what used to
be the Corleone business in New York.

3501
07:24:03,864 --> 07:24:07,741
Out of kindness, he gave you
a job in his family.

3502
07:24:07,826 --> 07:24:10,452
You took it against my advice.

3503
07:24:10,579 --> 07:24:15,833
I offered you something better in the
legitimate world. You turned me down.

3504
07:24:15,959 --> 07:24:20,921
Now you both come to me with this bad
blood. What do you expect me to do?

3505
07:24:23,049 --> 07:24:24,550
- Am I a gangster?
- No...

3506
07:24:24,634 --> 07:24:29,471
That was Papa's neighborhood.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace!

3507
07:24:29,556 --> 07:24:33,809
- That's the past, Connie.
- I earned that territory.

3508
07:24:33,894 --> 07:24:37,563
The Commission gave it to me
and you approved.

3509
07:24:37,647 --> 07:24:38,731
Yes.

3510
07:24:38,815 --> 07:24:43,569
I came for the party, not to ask for help.
I could kill this bastard.

3511
07:24:43,653 --> 07:24:45,112
So kill him.

3512
07:24:46,656 --> 07:24:49,742
What does all this have to do with me?

3513
07:24:49,826 --> 07:24:55,039
Well, he goes behind your back,
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone".

3514
07:24:55,123 --> 07:24:57,833
Say it to his face, one time!

3515
07:24:59,294 --> 07:25:04,465
Mr. Corleone, all bastards are liars.
Shakespeare wrote poems about it.

3516
07:25:04,549 --> 07:25:07,593
What am I going to do with this guy?

3517
07:25:13,808 --> 07:25:18,520
Joey, if there's some guy
running around this city,

3518
07:25:18,605 --> 07:25:21,231
saying, "Fuck Michael Corleone"...

3519
07:25:22,692 --> 07:25:25,903
...what do we do
with a piece of shit like that?

3520
07:25:28,239 --> 07:25:30,282
He's a fucking dog.

3521
07:25:37,374 --> 07:25:40,960
Yes, it's true.
If anyone would say such a thing,

3522
07:25:41,044 --> 07:25:44,463
they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

3523
07:25:50,720 --> 07:25:56,892
- My interests don't conflict with his.
- You don't know how much they do.

3524
07:25:56,977 --> 07:25:58,435
Quiet, Vincent.

3525
07:25:58,520 --> 07:26:00,729
He needs your support!

3526
07:26:00,814 --> 07:26:03,565
Don't let me work for this guy,
let me work for you.

3527
07:26:03,650 --> 07:26:09,697
As what? Tough guy? I don't need
tough guys. I need more lawyers.

3528
07:26:12,993 --> 07:26:19,123
Since we have no conflicts or debts,
I accept your tribute. I wish you well.

3529
07:26:20,917 --> 07:26:25,379
Vincent, make your peace
with Mr. Joe Zasa. Go on.

3530
07:26:36,433 --> 07:26:37,808
<i>Bastardo...</i>

3531
07:26:43,606 --> 07:26:46,442
Vinnie, what's the matter with you?

3532
07:26:46,526 --> 07:26:48,444
Get him out of here.

3533
07:26:50,447 --> 07:26:52,239
Jesus Christ...

3534
07:26:53,283 --> 07:26:55,200
- I told Connie this wasn't the right time.
- Close it.

3535
07:26:55,285 --> 07:27:00,581
I know you're into Wall Street,
but you're still the final word.

3536
07:27:00,707 --> 07:27:03,625
I want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't.

3537
07:27:03,710 --> 07:27:06,336
- But you can?
- Yeah, I can do that.

3538
07:27:07,964 --> 07:27:09,882
Why should I be afraid of Zasa?

3539
07:27:09,966 --> 07:27:13,343
You stop him from rising
in the Commission.

3540
07:27:13,428 --> 07:27:16,764
I say we make him dead.
Give me the order, I'll do it.

3541
07:27:16,848 --> 07:27:18,432
- You'll do it?
- Yeah.

3542
07:27:23,146 --> 07:27:27,900
Maybe you should come with me
for a few weeks. See what happens.

3543
07:27:28,568 --> 07:27:30,652
- Okay.
- See if you learn.

3544
07:27:32,155 --> 07:27:34,782
And we'll talk about your future.

3545
07:27:36,326 --> 07:27:38,202
I won't let you down.

3546
07:27:45,043 --> 07:27:46,710
It's about ready.

3547
07:27:53,009 --> 07:27:54,009
So, what happened?

3548
07:27:54,094 --> 07:27:55,302
What happened?

3549
07:27:55,386 --> 07:27:58,722
If I'm in a room with Zasa,
what happens? I bit his ear off.

3550
07:27:58,807 --> 07:28:01,058
Here we go. Watch the card.

3551
07:28:03,853 --> 07:28:05,270
Hold it!

3552
07:28:07,524 --> 07:28:09,274
- Vincent...
- Yeah.

3553
07:28:09,359 --> 07:28:11,652
Take the picture with us.

3554
07:28:19,035 --> 07:28:20,494
Nice jacket.

3555
07:28:22,539 --> 07:28:25,082
Closer to the center, sir.

3556
07:28:26,960 --> 07:28:28,961
Smile!

3557
07:28:49,315 --> 07:28:53,902
Godfather, this is the cake for you
and your family from Enzo the baker.

3558
07:28:55,196 --> 07:28:57,114
Do you want to do it?

3559
07:29:43,244 --> 07:29:46,455
Cent'anni! Cent'anni!

3560
07:30:45,932 --> 07:30:48,934
- Vincent?
- What do you want, sweetheart?

3561
07:30:51,271 --> 07:30:52,938
Do you love me?

3562
07:30:54,357 --> 07:30:56,984
- Come on, go to bed.
- Come on, say it.

3563
07:30:58,861 --> 07:31:00,696
I love you.

3564
07:31:01,406 --> 07:31:03,365
I love you, too.

3565
07:31:05,868 --> 07:31:07,577
You've got a cat?

3566
07:31:14,419 --> 07:31:17,296
Go get us some water, I'm thirsty.
Come on.

3567
07:31:18,256 --> 07:31:19,715
Come on.

3568
07:31:27,181 --> 07:31:29,933
Well, I guess I know my place.

3569
07:31:30,852 --> 07:31:33,687
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

3570
07:31:34,439 --> 07:31:38,150
"Get me water, bake me a cake"...
What happened to "please"?

3571
07:32:25,698 --> 07:32:28,533
Good boy, Sackface. Go for a walk.

3572
07:32:37,960 --> 07:32:40,796
- Let her go.
- Cut her throat, man.

3573
07:32:43,549 --> 07:32:46,510
- What did you say?
- Cut her fucking throat.

3574
07:32:49,806 --> 07:32:52,891
- Okay, chief...
- Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.

3575
07:32:52,975 --> 07:32:57,229
I hardly know her, so cut her.
What the fuck do I care?

3576
07:32:59,190 --> 07:33:02,859
You've got no choice. She'll be dead.

3577
07:33:02,944 --> 07:33:06,905
If you do, I'll kill you both.
Give up that knife, I'll let you go.

3578
07:33:06,989 --> 07:33:09,574
Cut her throat! Right now!

3579
07:33:09,659 --> 07:33:15,872
I'll do something that'll convince you.
Don't get frightened. Just watch me.

3580
07:33:20,711 --> 07:33:22,295
Oh, shit!

3581
07:33:24,340 --> 07:33:26,842
Drop the knife. Drop it!

3582
07:33:26,968 --> 07:33:33,682
Good boy. Sit down, I want to talk
to you. It was a wise choice. Sit down.

3583
07:33:33,766 --> 07:33:35,350
Lose the mask.

3584
07:33:38,688 --> 07:33:41,106
Relax, have a smoke. You smoke?

3585
07:33:43,860 --> 07:33:46,403
Whose idea was this? Who sent you?

3586
07:33:47,155 --> 07:33:50,031
Tell me who sent you.

3587
07:33:52,201 --> 07:33:54,995
- No one.
- Did you take a look at this guy?

3588
07:33:55,079 --> 07:33:57,205
- Yeah.
- Who sent you?

3589
07:33:59,792 --> 07:34:02,210
It was Joey Zasa.

3590
07:34:16,934 --> 07:34:18,560
Are you okay?

3591
07:34:21,772 --> 07:34:24,941
- You were going to let them kill me!
- No, I wasn't...

3592
07:34:25,026 --> 07:34:27,569
You pig! You sick fuck!

3593
07:34:29,739 --> 07:34:33,366
You wanted gambling. That's gambling.
Call the police.

3594
07:34:38,289 --> 07:34:41,708
- You killed the other guy too?
- He went for my gun.

3595
07:34:42,502 --> 07:34:45,629
It was self-defense.
Go ahead, call the police.

3596
07:34:46,881 --> 07:34:48,882
- No, no...
- I'm taking pictures.

3597
07:34:48,966 --> 07:34:50,592
No pictures.

3598
07:34:52,512 --> 07:34:53,762
<i>You had a gun!</i>

3599
07:34:54,180 --> 07:34:59,100
They only had a knife. You could have
handed them over to the police.

3600
07:34:59,936 --> 07:35:02,979
Zasa sent them.
I just sent him a message.

3601
07:35:04,190 --> 07:35:09,361
- Now he has to send you one back.
- Zasa is going to send me one back?

3602
07:35:09,445 --> 07:35:12,280
He did the right thing.
He got Zasa's name!

3603
07:35:12,365 --> 07:35:16,201
What has Joey Zasa to do
with anything? Joey Zasa is a pazzo.

3604
07:35:19,872 --> 07:35:22,249
All right. You are what you are.

3605
07:35:23,042 --> 07:35:25,919
It's your nature. Stay close to me.

3606
07:35:26,003 --> 07:35:30,215
Don't do anything. Keep your mouth
shut and your eyes open.

3607
07:35:30,299 --> 07:35:33,093
- And you do what I tell you.
- I understand.

3608
07:35:33,177 --> 07:35:36,513
- I have problems with the Commission.
- I know.

3609
07:35:36,597 --> 07:35:41,393
- You don't make them easier.
- It wasn't my idea that this happened.

3610
07:35:42,311 --> 07:35:44,729
- Get out of here.
- Michael...

3611
07:35:45,439 --> 07:35:46,648
Yes?

3612
07:35:48,484 --> 07:35:52,153
- Now they'll fear you.
- Maybe they should fear you.

3613
07:35:56,117 --> 07:35:59,911
- B.J., what's up?
- The Archbishop just called back.

3614
07:35:59,996 --> 07:36:02,622
We've arranged some amazing things.

3615
07:36:02,748 --> 07:36:06,960
The publicity is phenomenal. You're the
new Rockefeller. A philanthropist.

3616
07:36:09,463 --> 07:36:12,674
- Sign here, please.
- Times do change, don't they?

3617
07:36:13,384 --> 07:36:17,929
My father hated foundations.
He loved doing it by himself.

3618
07:36:19,140 --> 07:36:21,516
Man to man. But we're different.

3619
07:36:21,642 --> 07:36:27,230
No different than any large corporation.
We control a lot of money with little.

3620
07:36:27,315 --> 07:36:31,693
Minimize taxes.
With no government control.

3621
07:36:40,620 --> 07:36:43,204
- Godfather.
- Andrew.

3622
07:36:44,582 --> 07:36:49,878
- Off to Rome...
- I wanted to thank you for everything.

3623
07:36:50,421 --> 07:36:53,506
- Do you want some breakfast?
- Thanks, I can't.

3624
07:36:54,091 --> 07:36:58,011
<i>- How's your Italian?
- Devo fare un po' di pratica.</i>

3625
07:36:59,305 --> 07:37:01,556
- His father was a great lawyer.
- I know.

3626
07:37:01,641 --> 07:37:06,311
Didn't live to see him ordained. I did.
Did you ever see one of those?

3627
07:37:06,395 --> 07:37:09,856
Beautiful. I was so proud.
Let me walk you out.

3628
07:37:11,317 --> 07:37:13,818
If you hear any rumors in the Vatican,
let me know.

3629
07:37:13,903 --> 07:37:16,446
No, Andrew has the true faith.

3630
07:37:26,207 --> 07:37:28,166
<i>Don Corleone,</i>

3631
07:37:28,250 --> 07:37:32,253
I need your help. And not just
to light a little candle.

3632
07:37:34,006 --> 07:37:40,804
My gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the Holy Church.

3633
07:37:41,931 --> 07:37:46,434
Then Rome decides to put me
in charge of the Vatican Bank...

3634
07:37:48,771 --> 07:37:51,606
...but I was never a true banker.

3635
07:37:54,777 --> 07:37:58,905
Mea culpa. I trusted my friends.

3636
07:38:00,282 --> 07:38:02,283
Friendship and money...

3637
07:38:03,369 --> 07:38:05,203
Oil and water...

3638
07:38:05,287 --> 07:38:06,579
Indeed.

3639
07:38:07,206 --> 07:38:13,920
But these "friends" used the good name
of the Church to feed their greed.

3640
07:38:15,214 --> 07:38:17,257
If money was lost...

3641
07:38:18,801 --> 07:38:20,719
...then I am to blame.

3642
07:38:23,013 --> 07:38:27,767
If only prayer could pay off
our 700 million dollar deficit.

3643
07:38:29,937 --> 07:38:32,105
769 million...

3644
07:38:38,028 --> 07:38:43,199
The Church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation. Immobiliare.

3645
07:38:44,160 --> 07:38:46,244
You know the one I mean?

3646
07:38:46,328 --> 07:38:50,874
Largest landlord on Earth.
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

3647
07:38:53,335 --> 07:38:55,086
That's true.

3648
07:38:55,838 --> 07:38:59,424
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

3649
07:39:02,178 --> 07:39:04,804
No, you're mistaken.

3650
07:39:05,431 --> 07:39:09,768
This isn't a question of one person
deciding. One deciding vote.

3651
07:39:09,852 --> 07:39:15,690
This is like any other company.
We have directors and very old rules.

3652
07:39:16,734 --> 07:39:20,695
The Pope himself
would have to approve you.

3653
07:39:25,743 --> 07:39:27,702
We've sold the casinos.

3654
07:39:29,455 --> 07:39:32,332
All businesses having to do
with gambling.

3655
07:39:33,459 --> 07:39:39,047
We have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate.

3656
07:39:42,176 --> 07:39:46,763
The Corleones are prepared to deposit
500 million dollars in the Vatican Bank

3657
07:39:46,847 --> 07:39:50,558
when Mr. Corleone receives majority
control of Immobiliare.

3658
07:39:50,643 --> 07:39:55,563
Immobiliare could be something new.
A European conglomerate.

3659
07:39:57,233 --> 07:40:01,110
Few families have control
of such a company.

3660
07:40:04,448 --> 07:40:06,908
It seems that, in today's world,

3661
07:40:07,576 --> 07:40:11,788
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness.

3662
07:40:14,041 --> 07:40:15,917
600 million dollars.

3663
07:40:20,965 --> 07:40:24,008
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

3664
07:40:26,387 --> 07:40:28,179
Don Corleone,

3665
07:40:28,264 --> 07:40:32,892
this deal with Immobiliare can make you
one of the richest men in the world.

3666
07:40:33,602 --> 07:40:38,773
Your whole past history, and the history
of your family, would be washed away.

3667
07:40:43,070 --> 07:40:44,696
600 million.

3668
07:41:00,921 --> 07:41:04,924
<i>The motion under discussion
relates to Corleone Group's proposal</i>

3669
07:41:06,051 --> 07:41:11,055
<i>to acquire 100,000,000 newly issued
Class A voting shares.</i>

3670
07:41:14,226 --> 07:41:18,897
<i>...Corleone capital invested directly
into International Immobiliare,</i>

3671
07:41:19,982 --> 07:41:23,359
<i>an old and respected
European company.</i>

3672
07:41:24,236 --> 07:41:29,782
Mr. Corleone has an ambitious program
to expand this real estate company

3673
07:41:29,867 --> 07:41:32,869
into an international conglomerate...

3674
07:41:34,663 --> 07:41:41,628
...by Eastern techniques of efficiency
and focus and unlimited...

3675
07:41:41,837 --> 07:41:43,922
Mr. Corleone, excuse me.

3676
07:41:44,465 --> 07:41:47,800
Didn't you recently deposit 200 million
in the Vatican Bank,

3677
07:41:47,885 --> 07:41:51,346
which is affiliated with Immobiliare?

3678
07:41:51,430 --> 07:41:52,889
True. Why not?

3679
07:41:52,973 --> 07:41:59,437
Wasn't there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit?

3680
07:41:59,521 --> 07:42:01,731
Mr. Chairman, if I may?

3681
07:42:03,484 --> 07:42:07,946
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,
of which Mary Corleone is chairman,

3682
07:42:08,030 --> 07:42:11,449
has made an endowment
of 100 million dollars.

3683
07:42:11,575 --> 07:42:15,912
The money comes from his own family
and will be administered by the Vatican.

3684
07:42:15,996 --> 07:42:18,373
Does that answer your question?

3685
07:42:18,874 --> 07:42:25,213
I have always believed that helping your
fellow man is profitable in every sense,

3686
07:42:25,631 --> 07:42:27,757
personally and bottom line.

3687
07:42:28,509 --> 07:42:34,138
My fellow shareholders, if Europe
and America can learn to co-operate,

3688
07:42:34,223 --> 07:42:38,559
if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets,

3689
07:42:38,644 --> 07:42:43,898
we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world.

3690
07:42:43,983 --> 07:42:46,484
Thank you for your time.

3691
07:42:46,568 --> 07:42:51,364
I hope that you will look favorably
on my proposal. Thank you.

3692
07:42:57,413 --> 07:42:59,831
Let me have this microphone here.

3693
07:42:59,957 --> 07:43:05,628
Will we let a criminal run our company?
He's got the map of Sicily on his face!

3694
07:43:05,713 --> 07:43:06,963
Order!

3695
07:43:07,047 --> 07:43:09,757
He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...

3696
07:43:12,302 --> 07:43:16,097
The Hamilton Investors Group
cannot support this proposal.

3697
07:43:17,474 --> 07:43:19,267
Your Excellency...

3698
07:43:20,185 --> 07:43:21,769
Mr. Chairman...

3699
07:43:22,271 --> 07:43:27,984
...the Vatican Bank feels
that International Immobiliare...

3700
07:43:30,279 --> 07:43:34,032
...will be safe in Mr. Corleone's hands.

3701
07:43:34,783 --> 07:43:39,704
...subject to audit and final ratification,
which must take place in Rome.

3702
07:43:39,788 --> 07:43:43,166
Please join me in welcoming
Mr. Michael Corleone.

3703
07:43:53,969 --> 07:43:55,136
Dad?

3704
07:43:57,973 --> 07:44:01,017
Tony says that I'm a front
for the foundation.

3705
07:44:03,020 --> 07:44:05,897
That you're using me to pull the strings.

3706
07:44:06,648 --> 07:44:09,609
- To get the money where you want it.
- Please!

3707
07:44:10,110 --> 07:44:13,112
- To shine up your public image.
- Mary!

3708
07:44:14,239 --> 07:44:17,700
Mary, this is real.
This foundation is real.

3709
07:44:20,662 --> 07:44:25,666
I wanted Anthony to be part of it.
I thought you would be together on this.

3710
07:44:25,751 --> 07:44:30,213
I won't interfere.
I'll help, but only if you ask.

3711
07:44:30,297 --> 07:44:32,298
What is this really for?

3712
07:44:33,175 --> 07:44:36,344
Why are you doing this?
Why am I doing this?

3713
07:44:38,180 --> 07:44:42,767
I'm doing this for my children.
You're doing it for your children too.

3714
07:44:43,936 --> 07:44:47,021
This foundation is supposed to
help all people.

3715
07:44:47,106 --> 07:44:49,482
That's the purpose.

3716
07:44:49,566 --> 07:44:54,153
This is legitimate.
Mary, I swear, this is legitimate.

3717
07:44:58,450 --> 07:45:01,410
Dad, I want this to bring me
closer to you.

3718
07:45:09,878 --> 07:45:13,548
I would burn in hell to keep you safe.

3719
07:45:27,771 --> 07:45:30,815
Go in the other car.
I'll ride with Michael.

3720
07:45:30,899 --> 07:45:32,567
Go, go, go.

3721
07:45:46,623 --> 07:45:52,086
As your family's oldest friend, I'm
always chosen to bring you messages.

3722
07:45:54,882 --> 07:45:57,049
Tell me, Don Altobello.

3723
07:45:59,595 --> 07:46:04,432
Your old partners are grateful for
the money you made them.

3724
07:46:04,516 --> 07:46:06,309
They worship you...

3725
07:46:07,102 --> 07:46:13,107
...but their hearts are broken, because
they think you abandoned them.

3726
07:46:13,859 --> 07:46:20,198
They want to share your deal
on Immobiliare, to be a family again.

3727
07:46:20,282 --> 07:46:22,783
It can purify their money.

3728
07:46:25,120 --> 07:46:26,871
This I cannot do.

3729
07:46:29,791 --> 07:46:32,627
Immobiliare must be legitimate.

3730
07:46:35,047 --> 07:46:36,297
I know.

3731
07:46:37,341 --> 07:46:39,383
But they're unhappy.

3732
07:46:41,511 --> 07:46:42,803
And you?

3733
07:46:43,805 --> 07:46:49,185
I ask nothing for myself.
Only peace in my old age.

3734
07:46:49,811 --> 07:46:52,897
But I must please the world around me.

3735
07:46:54,983 --> 07:47:00,863
Michael, your father was
a reasonable man. Learn from him.

3736
07:47:03,408 --> 07:47:06,535
I learned many things from my father.

3737
07:47:12,167 --> 07:47:17,713
Call a meeting, my friend,
so there are no debts or grudges.

3738
07:47:18,966 --> 07:47:21,801
We will make the peace, you and I.

3739
07:47:38,902 --> 07:47:41,737
<i>The Vatican announced today...</i>

3740
07:47:41,863 --> 07:47:45,658
<i>that Pope Paul VI has canceled
his Sunday blessing...</i>

3741
07:47:45,784 --> 07:47:47,618
<i>due to ill health.</i>

3742
07:47:47,786 --> 07:47:50,746
<i>His physician has ordered
total bedrest...</i>

3743
07:47:50,998 --> 07:47:53,708
<i>and cessation of all activities.</i>

3744
07:48:01,717 --> 07:48:03,759
They've had a press conference.

3745
07:48:03,844 --> 07:48:07,013
The Pope's condition
is grave. "Gravissimo. "

3746
07:48:35,834 --> 07:48:39,253
The purpose of this meeting
is to ratify...

3747
07:48:39,546 --> 07:48:43,007
the motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

3748
07:48:44,760 --> 07:48:46,052
Please...

3749
07:48:47,095 --> 07:48:51,682
Our group represents a consortium
of Catholic businessmen

3750
07:48:51,767 --> 07:48:54,602
against the Corleone control.

3751
07:48:55,604 --> 07:49:00,858
The Vatican has cast its vote. Corleone
Group already controls the Board.

3752
07:49:00,942 --> 07:49:05,529
According to the Lateran Treaty,
the Vatican vote must be ratified here.

3753
07:49:05,614 --> 07:49:07,782
Here in Rome, by the Pope.

3754
07:49:11,828 --> 07:49:14,955
The Pope is gravely ill.

3755
07:49:16,458 --> 07:49:20,002
Until he recovers, I am powerless.

3756
07:49:21,296 --> 07:49:24,298
- What if he dies?
- Then...

3757
07:49:25,133 --> 07:49:28,636
...as you Americans say, all bets are off.

3758
07:49:28,720 --> 07:49:30,638
Gentlemen, please.

3759
07:49:32,057 --> 07:49:35,393
This is a brief delay. Nothing more.

3760
07:49:40,482 --> 07:49:42,775
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

3761
07:49:44,027 --> 07:49:49,240
I advise you to join us in our prayers
for the Holy Father's recovery.

3762
07:49:50,784 --> 07:49:52,660
We had an agreement!

3763
07:49:53,995 --> 07:49:57,748
This meeting was to be
merely a formality.

3764
07:49:57,833 --> 07:50:03,212
- Please sit down.
- I'd rather stand. Give me an answer.

3765
07:50:03,338 --> 07:50:08,884
The Immobiliare has its roots in the
European tradition. Please understand.

3766
07:50:09,636 --> 07:50:13,013
I understand.
Your tactics are despicable.

3767
07:50:13,098 --> 07:50:16,225
That's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

3768
07:50:16,309 --> 07:50:20,604
- Gentlemen, gentlemen!
- Remember you are in the Vatican.

3769
07:50:24,526 --> 07:50:30,197
- What is it that you want?
- Yes, you will take control.

3770
07:50:31,366 --> 07:50:34,785
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet,

3771
07:50:35,370 --> 07:50:39,206
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

3772
07:50:40,792 --> 07:50:46,380
Otherwise, who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

3773
07:50:48,550 --> 07:50:54,430
It's not personal. It's only business.
You should know, Godfather.

3774
07:50:58,477 --> 07:50:59,810
Very well.

3775
07:51:01,229 --> 07:51:06,150
You want to do business with me?
I will do business with you.

3776
07:51:07,194 --> 07:51:09,111
Vipers, all of them.

3777
07:51:15,202 --> 07:51:18,287
- We're back with the Borgias!
- Uncle Michael...

3778
07:51:18,371 --> 07:51:21,665
- Andrew!
- I heard you were here.

3779
07:51:21,750 --> 07:51:25,294
It's so nice to see you.
Vincent, it's so nice.

3780
07:51:26,171 --> 07:51:29,548
What is this about the Borgias?
Those days are over.

3781
07:51:34,930 --> 07:51:37,014
- Recognize it?
- Yeah.

3782
07:51:38,767 --> 07:51:44,688
Genco Olive Oil. That's where our
grandfather started as a delivery boy.

3783
07:51:44,773 --> 07:51:47,107
Three years later he owned it.

3784
07:51:47,192 --> 07:51:49,443
- Only in America.
- That's it.

3785
07:51:50,445 --> 07:51:55,574
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?
We need your help so badly.

3786
07:51:55,659 --> 07:51:59,370
- What can I do for you?
- Get rid of Joe Zasa. He sells drugs...

3787
07:51:59,454 --> 07:52:04,542
Now that I'm an older woman,
I'm afraid to go out at night.

3788
07:52:04,626 --> 07:52:07,002
Where should they be now?

3789
07:52:07,087 --> 07:52:10,130
- Lou, what's going on?
- We're late.

3790
07:52:12,259 --> 07:52:14,885
- Have I ever let you down?
- I trust you.

3791
07:52:14,970 --> 07:52:17,346
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

3792
07:52:17,430 --> 07:52:19,139
Enjoy yourselves.

3793
07:52:25,855 --> 07:52:29,650
- What was that?
- The neighborhood's in trouble.

3794
07:52:30,735 --> 07:52:33,529
- Do you keep an eye out for them?
- Yes.

3795
07:52:33,613 --> 07:52:36,240
- And for me?
- From now on.

3796
07:52:37,450 --> 07:52:41,370
- I've missed you all this time.
- I missed you too, cousin.

3797
07:52:41,496 --> 07:52:46,292
I missed growing up with my cousins.
I didn't even know you, but missed you.

3798
07:52:47,586 --> 07:52:52,172
Do you remember stories about
our fathers? The old days?

3799
07:52:52,257 --> 07:52:54,675
Yeah, what do you want to know?

3800
07:52:56,970 --> 07:53:02,308
- What was Sonny like?
- Well, he was the Prince of the City.

3801
07:53:03,852 --> 07:53:07,521
He died before I was born,
but I've heard a lot about him.

3802
07:53:09,232 --> 07:53:12,735
- What about my father?
- He's a great man.

3803
07:53:14,237 --> 07:53:16,697
He's a hero. He saved the family.

3804
07:53:18,700 --> 07:53:20,409
- Vincent?
- What?

3805
07:53:20,493 --> 07:53:22,786
Did he kill his own brother?

3806
07:53:27,125 --> 07:53:28,292
No.

3807
07:53:30,879 --> 07:53:32,546
So, it's all lies?

3808
07:53:37,135 --> 07:53:40,304
Just stories, sweetheart. Okay?

3809
07:53:44,434 --> 07:53:45,643
Okay.

3810
07:53:47,437 --> 07:53:49,063
I believe you.

3811
07:53:50,231 --> 07:53:53,609
- I'm glad you're around.
- I'm glad you're here too.

3812
07:53:58,531 --> 07:54:00,032
<i>Cugina...</i>

3813
07:54:01,034 --> 07:54:02,451
Cous...

3814
07:54:16,841 --> 07:54:20,511
I'd like to take Joey Zasa for a ride
in this and drop him.

3815
07:54:20,595 --> 07:54:22,763
Joey Zasa is nothing.

3816
07:54:23,640 --> 07:54:27,351
He's a small time enforcer.
He bluffs and threatens.

3817
07:54:27,435 --> 07:54:31,230
He's nothing.
You can see him coming a mile away.

3818
07:54:32,232 --> 07:54:34,817
- We should kill him before he...
- No!

3819
07:54:37,946 --> 07:54:42,116
Never hate your enemies.
It affects your judgment.

3820
07:54:58,466 --> 07:55:01,093
Nice to see you again, Mr. Corleone.

3821
07:55:21,156 --> 07:55:23,574
Hey, girls. Let's go.

3822
07:55:41,718 --> 07:55:46,096
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

3823
07:55:46,181 --> 07:55:52,102
It's not even 20 years. You've sold the
casinos and made fortunes for all of us.

3824
07:55:52,187 --> 07:55:54,354
Bravo, Don Corleone!

3825
07:55:56,566 --> 07:55:58,025
Thank you.

3826
07:55:58,777 --> 07:56:05,532
Friends, I have come here
because our business together is done.

3827
07:56:07,368 --> 07:56:09,077
We have prospered,

3828
07:56:09,162 --> 07:56:14,333
and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us.

3829
07:56:16,586 --> 07:56:18,128
That's it.

3830
07:56:18,213 --> 07:56:21,465
But I do have a little surprise. Al?

3831
07:56:24,385 --> 07:56:26,553
Your shares in the casinos.

3832
07:56:27,263 --> 07:56:31,266
I thought I cut through all the red tape,
so you could get your money right away.

3833
07:56:37,690 --> 07:56:40,025
50 million dollars!

3834
07:56:40,109 --> 07:56:43,654
- Not everybody gets the same.
- Nothing for you...

3835
07:56:43,738 --> 07:56:48,742
- It depends on your investment.
- Michael, this is really generous!

3836
07:56:49,786 --> 07:56:51,203
Wonderful!

3837
07:56:54,290 --> 07:56:58,836
- Parisi, how much did you invest?
- I don't remember.

3838
07:56:59,587 --> 07:57:01,338
You're blessed.

3839
07:57:06,302 --> 07:57:11,056
My family has done much of
the hard work, taken many risks.

3840
07:57:13,309 --> 07:57:16,478
All to make money
for the rest of the families.

3841
07:57:18,857 --> 07:57:20,899
You all know Joey Zasa.

3842
07:57:21,860 --> 07:57:24,319
He is, I admit, an important man.

3843
07:57:25,321 --> 07:57:29,116
His picture is on the cover
of the New York Times magazine.

3844
07:57:29,701 --> 07:57:33,745
He gets the Esquire Magazine award
for the best dressed gangster.

3845
07:57:34,914 --> 07:57:36,832
The newspapers praise him

3846
07:57:36,916 --> 07:57:41,461
because he hires Blacks,
which shows he has a good heart.

3847
07:57:44,090 --> 07:57:45,716
He is famous.

3848
07:57:46,467 --> 07:57:52,639
Who knows? Maybe one day
he'll make all of you popular.

3849
07:57:54,309 --> 07:57:55,434
It's true.

3850
07:57:55,518 --> 07:58:01,231
I make more of a bella figura.
That is my nature.

3851
07:58:01,316 --> 07:58:06,403
But I also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises.

3852
07:58:06,487 --> 07:58:09,156
I'd like a little pin from the Pope.

3853
07:58:09,657 --> 07:58:14,745
Sure, I take the Blacks
and the Spanish into my family,

3854
07:58:14,829 --> 07:58:18,373
because that's America.

3855
07:58:19,125 --> 07:58:22,502
And you guarantee
that they don't deal drugs?

3856
07:58:24,297 --> 07:58:28,926
I don't guarantee that. I guarantee
that I'll kill anybody who does.

3857
07:58:33,598 --> 07:58:38,769
- Let me talk to him.
- Who can refuse Don Altobello?

3858
07:58:39,270 --> 07:58:41,521
- Joey, are you...
- No!

3859
07:58:42,357 --> 07:58:47,694
I say to all of you, I have been
treated this day with no respect.

3860
07:58:48,863 --> 07:58:54,326
I've earned you all money.
I've made you rich and I asked for little.

3861
07:58:54,410 --> 07:58:58,246
Good. You will not give, so I'll take!

3862
07:58:59,624 --> 07:59:02,125
As for Don Corleone,

3863
07:59:02,210 --> 07:59:08,215
he makes it very clear to me today
that he is my enemy.

3864
07:59:12,220 --> 07:59:14,388
You must choose between us.

3865
07:59:18,977 --> 07:59:20,143
No, Joey!

3866
07:59:21,729 --> 07:59:24,481
Michael, we could reason together.

3867
07:59:24,983 --> 07:59:26,358
No.

3868
07:59:27,777 --> 07:59:31,738
Michael, please... let's agree.

3869
07:59:32,407 --> 07:59:34,700
He doesn't know what he's...

3870
07:59:34,784 --> 07:59:36,243
No, no.

3871
07:59:41,249 --> 07:59:44,042
Michael, the news is everywhere.

3872
07:59:44,877 --> 07:59:49,006
Everyone says that you
control Immobiliare.

3873
07:59:49,090 --> 07:59:54,177
Immobiliare is already laundering
money in Peru and Nassau.

3874
07:59:55,430 --> 07:59:59,891
We've worked with you for 40 years.
We should wet our beaks a little.

3875
07:59:59,976 --> 08:00:04,938
- We want to do business with you.
- That's right, we've been together...

3876
08:00:14,949 --> 08:00:18,243
- It's a hit! Let's go!
- Let's get out of here! Move!

3877
08:00:37,555 --> 08:00:40,057
My coat! It's my lucky coat!

3878
08:00:41,225 --> 08:00:43,060
It's my lucky coat!

3879
08:00:49,233 --> 08:00:50,650
Stay behind me!

3880
08:01:06,834 --> 08:01:09,002
Mikey, this way!

3881
08:01:17,345 --> 08:01:20,555
Zasa, you son-of-a-bitch...

3882
08:01:41,035 --> 08:01:43,286
Come on. We're out of here.

3883
08:02:15,570 --> 08:02:17,904
<i>- You did good, Vincent.
- Grazie.</i>

3884
08:02:18,239 --> 08:02:21,491
The old Dons were pretty much
wiped out.

3885
08:02:21,576 --> 08:02:24,911
The survivors made deals with Zasa.

3886
08:02:26,038 --> 08:02:28,456
- Altobello?
- He survived.

3887
08:02:28,583 --> 08:02:33,461
He's with his daughters in Staten Island.
He says he's going to retire in Sicily.

3888
08:02:35,381 --> 08:02:39,926
Joey Zasa would never pull something
like this without the backing.

3889
08:02:40,761 --> 08:02:46,474
He's just muscle. He doesn't have
the wit for that helicopter attack.

3890
08:02:46,559 --> 08:02:50,896
He doesn't even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole Commission.

3891
08:02:50,980 --> 08:02:53,773
I say we hit back and take Zasa out!

3892
08:02:59,405 --> 08:03:02,365
Never let anyone know
what you're thinking.

3893
08:03:10,124 --> 08:03:13,126
Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

3894
08:03:16,339 --> 08:03:18,673
I respect what he's done.

3895
08:03:19,800 --> 08:03:22,719
The new overthrows the old. It's natural.

3896
08:03:23,179 --> 08:03:25,805
How can you do business with this guy?

3897
08:03:28,267 --> 08:03:32,270
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.
I want no further conflict.

3898
08:03:32,396 --> 08:03:36,816
- Tell him that he can live or he can die.
- Vincent, will you shut up!

3899
08:03:55,336 --> 08:03:56,878
That's it.

3900
08:03:59,090 --> 08:04:00,590
Joey Zasa...

3901
08:04:01,342 --> 08:04:03,677
He can't be doing this alone.

3902
08:04:07,473 --> 08:04:11,351
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

3903
08:04:20,111 --> 08:04:25,740
Our true enemy has not yet
shown his face.

3904
08:04:30,079 --> 08:04:31,413
Michael!

3905
08:04:38,254 --> 08:04:41,840
- Has he had his medicine?
- I don't know what he took.

3906
08:04:47,346 --> 08:04:49,597
- I've got my wind back.
- Call a doctor.

3907
08:04:49,682 --> 08:04:51,641
- Run, run, run!
- Vincent!

3908
08:04:51,726 --> 08:04:55,729
Run at thunder, girl! Thunder can't hurt!

3909
08:04:55,855 --> 08:04:57,897
Harmless noise!

3910
08:04:58,399 --> 08:05:03,236
Bullshit! You deceitful old fuck!

3911
08:05:04,113 --> 08:05:06,823
Altobello, you fuck!

3912
08:05:09,660 --> 08:05:10,910
Fredo!

3913
08:05:11,912 --> 08:05:13,496
Fredo!

3914
08:05:37,188 --> 08:05:39,647
Oh, God! Dad!

3915
08:05:42,276 --> 08:05:43,943
Excuse me.

3916
08:05:44,487 --> 08:05:46,112
I'll call Kay.

3917
08:05:56,832 --> 08:06:00,543
- Good evening, sir.
- Can we wait here? We'll be back soon.

3918
08:06:07,259 --> 08:06:13,181
Mr. Harrison, you said it was urgent.
Have you come to confess your sins?

3919
08:06:13,808 --> 08:06:18,478
Michael Corleone has had a diabetic
stroke. I wanted you to know about it.

3920
08:06:19,230 --> 08:06:24,359
He's in a coma. I'm here to insist
the deal goes through in any event.

3921
08:06:24,443 --> 08:06:26,861
The Pope has not much time left.

3922
08:06:28,114 --> 08:06:31,783
So, as you, I am in a difficult position.

3923
08:06:32,243 --> 08:06:35,453
We have to ratify this deal
as soon as possible.

3924
08:06:36,372 --> 08:06:39,207
- We have an understanding.
- Good.

3925
08:06:40,584 --> 08:06:44,170
- I'm going to the hospital.
- I'll pray for Mr. Corleone.

3926
08:06:48,968 --> 08:06:52,762
- Our thoughts are with Mr. Corleone.
- Thank you, Father Jim.

3927
08:06:55,349 --> 08:06:58,810
Everything will be out in the open
if Corleone dies.

3928
08:07:00,479 --> 08:07:02,564
Play for time, Keinszig.

3929
08:07:03,357 --> 08:07:07,694
A habit born of
a long contemplation of eternity.

3930
08:07:14,702 --> 08:07:18,580
- Forget about it, Vinnie.
- Why? It's a simple hit.

3931
08:07:18,664 --> 08:07:24,586
I'd love to smack Joey Zasa and then
whack the fag. But it's impossible.

3932
08:07:25,045 --> 08:07:30,508
He's always with people, in front of
TV cameras in his own neighborhood.

3933
08:07:30,593 --> 08:07:33,678
- It's not impossible. It'll work for us.
- How?

3934
08:07:34,346 --> 08:07:38,516
Do you think he's going to let
Uncle Michael survive? Would you?

3935
08:07:39,435 --> 08:07:41,561
He may not survive anyway.

3936
08:07:42,730 --> 08:07:45,565
- How would you do it?
- I'd do it myself.

3937
08:07:48,194 --> 08:07:49,444
Do it!

3938
08:07:51,739 --> 08:07:54,657
- What would you need?
- A couple of guys.

3939
08:08:25,731 --> 08:08:27,357
Hello, Michael.

3940
08:08:30,611 --> 08:08:31,945
It's Kay.

3941
08:08:37,243 --> 08:08:38,451
Kay...

3942
08:08:40,829 --> 08:08:42,830
I never expected you.

3943
08:08:43,791 --> 08:08:45,959
No, I know.

3944
08:08:48,420 --> 08:08:50,129
But I'm here.

3945
08:08:54,176 --> 08:08:56,135
- I'm glad.
- You know...

3946
08:08:59,557 --> 08:09:02,433
I've never seen you looking so helpless.

3947
08:09:06,564 --> 08:09:08,648
It's not so bad, really.

3948
08:09:10,693 --> 08:09:14,654
I feel... I'm getting wiser now.

3949
08:09:15,239 --> 08:09:17,198
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

3950
08:09:18,450 --> 08:09:23,913
- The sicker you get, the wiser you get?
- When I'm dead, I'll be really smart.

3951
08:09:25,749 --> 08:09:29,836
Michael... I want to thank you for Tony.

3952
08:09:33,173 --> 08:09:37,093
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices,

3953
08:09:37,595 --> 08:09:42,682
and he'll make his operatic debut
in Sicily, in Palermo this Easter, so...

3954
08:09:44,727 --> 08:09:45,852
So, thank you.

3955
08:09:47,688 --> 08:09:50,565
That's a real honor. In Sicily.

3956
08:09:55,738 --> 08:09:58,698
I will be there. I won't miss that.

3957
08:09:59,491 --> 08:10:01,326
I won't miss that.

3958
08:10:07,708 --> 08:10:09,959
Mary, Tony...

3959
08:10:11,462 --> 08:10:13,046
Go see Dad.

3960
08:10:19,136 --> 08:10:22,388
- Sweetheart!
- Everything's going to be all right.

3961
08:10:23,223 --> 08:10:25,558
- Tony!
- How are you doing, Pop?

3962
08:10:28,062 --> 08:10:31,147
Your mother told me what happened.

3963
08:10:31,231 --> 08:10:36,653
- About Palermo? I hope you'll be there.
- Of course. Kiss me.

3964
08:10:56,715 --> 08:11:01,094
<i>- Cousin Vinnie?
- He's not here. Call his apartment.</i>

3965
08:11:03,138 --> 08:11:05,723
- It's your cousin Mary.
- Let her in.

3966
08:11:10,396 --> 08:11:14,524
Hi, cous. I thought I'd drop by.
Is that okay?

3967
08:11:14,608 --> 08:11:16,526
I'll get the guys.

3968
08:11:18,404 --> 08:11:21,614
No, it's not okay.
You shouldn't have come, Mary.

3969
08:11:23,033 --> 08:11:25,451
Only a couple of minutes, okay?

3970
08:11:26,912 --> 08:11:29,914
- You look beautiful, cous.
- Thanks.

3971
08:11:32,835 --> 08:11:35,461
So this is your club, your hideout?

3972
08:11:36,130 --> 08:11:38,798
- Yeah.
- I came here to check it out.

3973
08:11:43,971 --> 08:11:47,932
It's so strange, just me
and Aunt Connie in the house.

3974
08:11:48,016 --> 08:11:52,311
- I feel better when I'm with you.
- What's wrong, sweetheart?

3975
08:11:52,980 --> 08:11:55,690
- I'm scared about my father.
- Don't be.

3976
08:11:55,816 --> 08:11:59,736
When they took him out of
the ambulance, I thought he was dead.

3977
08:11:59,820 --> 08:12:02,655
Everybody says he's going to be better.

3978
08:12:04,491 --> 08:12:06,117
Don't worry.

3979
08:12:06,702 --> 08:12:09,620
I remember a shooting when I was little.

3980
08:12:10,664 --> 08:12:15,460
And one time Al Neri and other
bodyguards took me and Tony away.

3981
08:12:17,421 --> 08:12:19,589
Is it all happening again?

3982
08:12:21,091 --> 08:12:23,092
Not like that, sweetie.

3983
08:12:24,678 --> 08:12:28,514
Then why are you hiding here?
Is something going to happen to you?

3984
08:12:30,517 --> 08:12:34,479
Nothing's going to happen
to me, cugina. We'll take care of you.

3985
08:12:45,699 --> 08:12:50,036
- Can I stay here and hide out with you?
- Can you help me cook for the boys?

3986
08:12:50,120 --> 08:12:53,831
You know that I don't know
how to cook, but I'll help.

3987
08:13:07,012 --> 08:13:08,262
Okay...

3988
08:13:09,223 --> 08:13:10,723
What do I do?

3989
08:13:43,090 --> 08:13:45,967
- I love you, cous.
- I love you, too, cous.

3990
08:13:49,888 --> 08:13:51,430
Let us cook.

3991
08:14:08,448 --> 08:14:09,782
Hold me.

3992
08:14:46,653 --> 08:14:51,157
You in the press and the police
use words like "Mafia", "Cosa Nostra".

3993
08:14:51,283 --> 08:14:56,787
This is a fantasy. We Italian-Americans
laid the bricks that built this city.

3994
08:14:56,872 --> 08:14:59,707
We have Meucci,
who invented the telephone.

3995
08:14:59,791 --> 08:15:03,711
We have Don Ameche,
who played the guy who invented it.

3996
08:15:04,421 --> 08:15:08,591
Buy yourself a raffle ticket,
maybe you'll win a Cadillac.

3997
08:15:09,176 --> 08:15:11,552
The salsiccia is wonderful!

3998
08:15:11,678 --> 08:15:13,596
Here, have a sandwich.

3999
08:15:26,401 --> 08:15:29,528
- Nice to see you, Mr. Zasa.
- Have a nice time.

4000
08:15:31,239 --> 08:15:33,658
Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets.

4001
08:15:37,037 --> 08:15:39,830
- What are you doing?
- He didn't mean it.

4002
08:15:40,624 --> 08:15:43,459
- Tell him you're sorry.
- Okay, let's go.

4003
08:16:02,354 --> 08:16:05,690
Joey! How are you?

4004
08:16:05,774 --> 08:16:07,733
How are you, Buddy boy?

4005
08:16:08,735 --> 08:16:11,737
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey, up your ass!

4006
08:16:13,824 --> 08:16:17,076
- Who is this? Do you know him?
- Ignore him.

4007
08:16:18,036 --> 08:16:21,122
Who's going to win the car? The Ant?

4008
08:16:22,207 --> 08:16:26,544
This is what gives Italian-Americans
a bad name. A cappone like this.

4009
08:16:26,920 --> 08:16:29,630
Joey, up your ass!

4010
08:16:29,715 --> 08:16:33,175
Get off the car!
Do you have a raffle ticket?

4011
08:16:33,260 --> 08:16:36,095
Joey, take a look at my raffle ticket!

4012
08:16:36,596 --> 08:16:40,891
Here's what I think of you...
and your raffle ticket.

4013
08:16:41,435 --> 08:16:45,104
Get the fuck off this car.
I'll break your fucking balls.

4014
08:16:47,941 --> 08:16:49,775
Get out of here!

4015
08:17:05,250 --> 08:17:07,752
Run, Joey! You piece of shit!

4016
08:17:20,724 --> 08:17:22,558
Open the door!

4017
08:17:22,642 --> 08:17:24,435
How are you, Joe?

4018
08:17:27,814 --> 08:17:29,023
Zasa!

4019
08:17:46,458 --> 08:17:53,380
Don't ever again give that kind of order.
Not while I'm alive.

4020
08:17:53,465 --> 08:17:54,840
Understand?

4021
08:17:56,760 --> 08:18:02,973
You were too sick to make a decision.
I got a go-ahead from Neri and Connie.

4022
08:18:04,017 --> 08:18:05,267
Connie?

4023
08:18:15,070 --> 08:18:17,822
It was the right decision, Uncle Mike.

4024
08:18:18,532 --> 08:18:22,368
It was the wrong decision.
I command this family!

4025
08:18:22,869 --> 08:18:24,829
Right or wrong...

4026
08:18:25,664 --> 08:18:28,374
...it was not what I wanted!

4027
08:18:47,060 --> 08:18:48,811
Do you understand?

4028
08:18:55,735 --> 08:18:56,861
Yes.

4029
08:19:03,660 --> 08:19:05,452
Come on, Michael.

4030
08:19:16,965 --> 08:19:18,340
Yes.

4031
08:19:20,427 --> 08:19:26,307
Good. Vincent, help me to my bed.
I want to talk to you alone for a minute.

4032
08:19:34,816 --> 08:19:38,402
You know,
I always felt responsible for you.

4033
08:19:39,696 --> 08:19:41,363
You know that.

4034
08:19:42,240 --> 08:19:43,866
Your father...

4035
08:19:44,993 --> 08:19:47,953
...my brother, we were opposites.

4036
08:19:48,622 --> 08:19:52,875
We would fight and argue.
But I never doubted his love.

4037
08:19:53,793 --> 08:19:58,005
He would do anything for me.
But his temper...

4038
08:20:01,801 --> 08:20:05,596
Too much. It clouded his reason.

4039
08:20:07,307 --> 08:20:09,975
I don't want you to make that mistake.

4040
08:20:12,854 --> 08:20:14,104
Also...

4041
08:20:15,148 --> 08:20:17,650
...he, too, had a way with women.

4042
08:20:19,694 --> 08:20:22,238
- Vincent...
- So I hear.

4043
08:20:22,322 --> 08:20:24,823
What are you doing with my daughter?

4044
08:20:27,494 --> 08:20:29,828
What are you doing with her?

4045
08:20:34,125 --> 08:20:36,043
It's too dangerous.

4046
08:20:39,130 --> 08:20:40,839
Do you hear me?

4047
08:20:46,930 --> 08:20:48,097
Okay.

4048
08:21:02,445 --> 08:21:04,029
Vincenzo...

4049
08:21:08,159 --> 08:21:12,037
When they come,
they'll come at what you love.

4050
08:21:20,672 --> 08:21:23,299
Michael, you must lead another life.

4051
08:21:24,217 --> 08:21:28,804
You have everything a man
could desire. It's time for you to retire.

4052
08:21:30,557 --> 08:21:33,017
I have too much responsibility.

4053
08:21:34,352 --> 08:21:39,982
Immobiliare? It's too difficult now.
You should really get out.

4054
08:21:40,066 --> 08:21:44,653
What do you know
about those pezzi da novanta in Italy?

4055
08:21:48,867 --> 08:21:52,202
I'm too old to know anything
about those new people.

4056
08:21:52,620 --> 08:21:56,749
I must accept my age
and grow my olives and tomatoes.

4057
08:21:58,585 --> 08:22:02,087
- We're not that old.
- But you're very ill.

4058
08:22:03,298 --> 08:22:07,343
Michael... Let me see
what can be done.

4059
08:22:08,470 --> 08:22:11,597
Let me work to make your path
a little easier.

4060
08:22:12,974 --> 08:22:18,020
- Your friendship does that always.
- That makes me happy.

4061
08:22:18,605 --> 08:22:22,733
Joey Zasa...
You were wrong about him.

4062
08:22:24,069 --> 08:22:27,363
I trust too much.
That's always been my fault.

4063
08:22:35,246 --> 08:22:38,749
Michael... treachery is everywhere.

4064
08:22:39,334 --> 08:22:42,836
You still have your fingers
on the strings, even now.

4065
08:22:45,006 --> 08:22:47,257
Let's see more of each other.

4066
08:22:48,009 --> 08:22:52,346
- Michael, in Sicily?
- In Sicily.

4067
08:22:53,306 --> 08:22:55,182
<i>In Sicilia.</i>

4068
08:22:55,850 --> 08:22:57,351
<i>In Sicilia.</i>

4069
08:23:45,483 --> 08:23:46,900
How are you?

4070
08:23:47,735 --> 08:23:50,571
Don Bendino, my old friend.

4071
08:24:21,895 --> 08:24:27,107
I brought you here, so that my old friend
and protector, Don Tommasino,

4072
08:24:27,609 --> 08:24:29,234
could advise us.

4073
08:24:30,904 --> 08:24:34,239
What do you think about Altobello?

4074
08:24:35,158 --> 08:24:37,910
A very talented man.

4075
08:24:38,411 --> 08:24:42,372
He has kept the peace between our
Sicilian and American friends.

4076
08:24:43,249 --> 08:24:45,584
The saint of reason.

4077
08:24:47,629 --> 08:24:51,465
A blood bath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

4078
08:24:52,634 --> 08:24:55,177
Joey Zasa at least was running
a tight ship,

4079
08:24:55,261 --> 08:24:59,139
but with him out of the picture
we must step in.

4080
08:24:59,224 --> 08:25:03,060
- Step back in...
- Or the Chinese and Colombians will.

4081
08:25:03,770 --> 08:25:08,690
The Corleones left drugs, so New York
is weak, and Palermo is strong.

4082
08:25:10,235 --> 08:25:14,279
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

4083
08:25:16,824 --> 08:25:21,328
Who could give the order
for that massacre...

4084
08:25:23,206 --> 08:25:27,167
and still pressure the Vatican deal?

4085
08:25:27,293 --> 08:25:32,506
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

4086
08:25:34,717 --> 08:25:38,136
"Our ships must all sail
in the same direction"...

4087
08:25:39,806 --> 08:25:45,686
Italian politics have had these men
for centuries. They are the true Mafia.

4088
08:25:45,770 --> 08:25:48,939
The Archbishop and the Vatican Bank,
that's the big problem.

4089
08:25:49,023 --> 08:25:53,026
They're the same problem.
B.J., they're connected.

4090
08:25:54,153 --> 08:25:57,155
The Archbishop has powerful friends.

4091
08:25:59,492 --> 08:26:01,118
They totally protect him.

4092
08:26:01,327 --> 08:26:05,831
Is there someone in the
Church we can turn to?

4093
08:26:05,957 --> 08:26:09,501
Someone we can tell
our problem to?

4094
08:26:10,837 --> 08:26:12,838
Cardinal Lamberto.

4095
08:26:13,047 --> 08:26:18,385
A wise and good man...
very influential.

4096
08:26:18,845 --> 08:26:22,014
He will see you.

4097
08:26:27,061 --> 08:26:32,649
I will see this Cardinal Lamberto
and see if we can work things out.

4098
08:26:34,485 --> 08:26:38,864
You honor your agreements,
but you are dealing with crooks.

4099
08:26:40,033 --> 08:26:42,034
They have no honor.

4100
08:26:44,162 --> 08:26:45,829
My word is final.

4101
08:26:57,008 --> 08:27:01,386
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

4102
08:27:23,076 --> 08:27:29,748
I've invited you all here to celebrate
my son's debut in an opera house...

4103
08:27:30,375 --> 08:27:32,084
We'll play "Philadelphia".

4104
08:27:33,670 --> 08:27:37,881
Seven cards. Two down, four up.
Deuces and one-eyedjacks are wild.

4105
08:27:37,965 --> 08:27:40,550
...in the opera "Cavallaria Rusticana".

4106
08:27:40,635 --> 08:27:44,971
- It's "Cavalleria Rusticana, " Dad.
- "Cavalleria. "

4107
08:27:45,098 --> 08:27:49,643
I think I have tickets to the wrong opera.
I've been in New York too long.

4108
08:27:50,728 --> 08:27:54,064
You will all receive tickets,
so come on time.

4109
08:27:54,148 --> 08:27:56,525
Dad, I've got a present for you.

4110
08:28:00,446 --> 08:28:04,533
It comes from the town of Corleone
and it's authentic Sicilian.

4111
08:28:05,743 --> 08:28:08,787
And... I learned it for you.

4112
08:29:38,753 --> 08:29:43,965
<i>She was wonderful, beautiful.
I loved her. And then she died.</i>

4113
08:29:45,551 --> 08:29:50,472
My trusted bodyguard
planted a bomb in my car.

4114
08:29:52,225 --> 08:29:54,392
She drove it before I did.

4115
08:29:55,937 --> 08:29:59,022
Why is such a beautiful country
so violent?

4116
08:29:59,565 --> 08:30:01,191
History.

4117
08:30:01,234 --> 08:30:05,695
Mom was telling me about when your
biggest worry was passing your exams.

4118
08:30:05,905 --> 08:30:09,199
- Yes, it was then.
- I worry about you now.

4119
08:30:09,826 --> 08:30:14,704
Oh, Mary, you're such a
warm-hearted girl. You always were.

4120
08:30:15,248 --> 08:30:18,667
- I love my family.
- Even your cousin Vincent?

4121
08:30:22,880 --> 08:30:24,756
I really love him.

4122
08:30:26,259 --> 08:30:29,427
- He's your first cousin.
- Then I love him first.

4123
08:30:30,513 --> 08:30:33,098
Mary, you can't see him.

4124
08:30:33,933 --> 08:30:36,142
Just don't see him anymore.

4125
08:30:37,144 --> 08:30:40,272
He's right. It's too dangerous.

4126
08:30:42,817 --> 08:30:45,777
Mary, you can't see him anymore.

4127
08:30:46,237 --> 08:30:48,446
- Not in that fashion.
- No.

4128
08:30:50,116 --> 08:30:53,451
- Please, promise me.
- No!

4129
08:30:53,536 --> 08:30:55,954
- Obey me on this.
- No, Dad!

4130
08:31:01,294 --> 08:31:05,297
Mary is smart, Dad.
She'll understand eventually.

4131
08:31:28,529 --> 08:31:31,156
<i>Bella cugina... Tesoro mio.</i>

4132
08:31:42,710 --> 08:31:45,003
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

4133
08:31:46,005 --> 08:31:49,257
I want you to do something for me.
It's dangerous.

4134
08:31:51,093 --> 08:31:54,346
Good. I'm in. What do you need?

4135
08:31:55,181 --> 08:31:58,266
I want you to sell your soul
to Don Altobello.

4136
08:31:59,018 --> 08:32:00,685
To betray me.

4137
08:32:04,106 --> 08:32:06,066
He'd never believe me.

4138
08:32:07,193 --> 08:32:09,527
- That depends.
- Sit down.

4139
08:32:12,448 --> 08:32:13,990
I have an idea.

4140
08:32:15,701 --> 08:32:19,120
See if you can learn
how high Altobello is connected.

4141
08:32:23,376 --> 08:32:25,168
Arrange a meeting.

4142
08:32:27,838 --> 08:32:32,258
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

4143
08:32:33,594 --> 08:32:36,388
- Ask for his help.
- What problems?

4144
08:32:38,391 --> 08:32:41,267
That you want to run away
with my daughter.

4145
08:32:42,061 --> 08:32:45,605
But you know that if you do,
I will become your enemy.

4146
08:32:50,820 --> 08:32:54,114
- You know that I would never do that.
- I know.

4147
08:32:55,533 --> 08:32:59,911
<i>Ask Altobello to speak to me.
To further the marriage.</i>

4148
08:33:00,705 --> 08:33:05,375
But you're cousins, after all. Michael
was always a little old-fashioned.

4149
08:33:06,752 --> 08:33:11,631
Say you can't belong to my legitimate
world. That you want your own family.

4150
08:33:12,425 --> 08:33:15,760
I could straighten out
what Joey Zasa left behind.

4151
08:33:17,346 --> 08:33:20,306
If you could use your friendship
to persuade him,

4152
08:33:21,350 --> 08:33:24,269
I would be indebted to you forever.

4153
08:33:26,230 --> 08:33:29,858
A Corleone knows the value
of such a friend.

4154
08:33:31,652 --> 08:33:34,112
Then you would work for me?

4155
08:33:34,947 --> 08:33:36,156
<i>S?</i>

4156
08:33:38,868 --> 08:33:41,536
<i>Bacio la mano, Don Altobello.</i>

4157
08:33:44,623 --> 08:33:49,627
If he hints that he wants you
to betray me, get insulted,

4158
08:33:50,254 --> 08:33:52,297
because that's his trap.

4159
08:33:59,013 --> 08:34:02,182
You're not telling me
the whole truth, Vincenzo.

4160
08:34:05,436 --> 08:34:11,107
Isn't it true, that with Michael gone,
the girl controls everything?

4161
08:34:15,362 --> 08:34:19,032
- Leave the girl out of this.
- Of course, you love her.

4162
08:34:19,116 --> 08:34:20,825
And she loves you.

4163
08:34:41,597 --> 08:34:44,724
I guessed it, didn't I?

4164
08:34:46,227 --> 08:34:51,064
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.
I'll be learning a lot from you.

4165
08:34:52,149 --> 08:34:55,860
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

4166
08:34:58,322 --> 08:35:01,074
It's my duty to make the introductions.

4167
08:35:07,832 --> 08:35:09,916
Don Lucchesi.

4168
08:35:12,545 --> 08:35:18,258
Don Altobello tells me that you have
a strong character. A man of respect.

4169
08:35:18,342 --> 08:35:21,719
This is the hero who put
Joey Zasa in his grave.

4170
08:35:22,221 --> 08:35:26,099
If we'd known of his existence,
we wouldn't have backed Joey.

4171
08:35:26,517 --> 08:35:28,560
No one wants another Joe.

4172
08:35:30,729 --> 08:35:32,856
Let me be your friend.

4173
08:35:33,357 --> 08:35:37,485
- Even the strongest man needs friends.
- I'm flattered.

4174
08:35:38,904 --> 08:35:43,408
You're a man of finance and politics.
Things I don't understand.

4175
08:35:45,161 --> 08:35:49,080
You understand guns.
Finance is a gun.

4176
08:35:50,249 --> 08:35:54,502
Politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger.

4177
08:35:59,049 --> 08:36:00,675
How can I help?

4178
08:36:01,427 --> 08:36:02,760
<i>Vieni?</i>

4179
08:36:05,848 --> 08:36:11,102
Blessed is the peacemaker,
for he can be called the child of God.

4180
08:36:11,478 --> 08:36:14,272
<i>- Tu parli Italiano un poco?
- S?</i>

4181
08:36:36,629 --> 08:36:39,464
The wheelchair, for Don Tommasino.

4182
08:36:47,389 --> 08:36:52,227
I trusted this business arrangement
with the Archbishop. I trusted him.

4183
08:36:52,311 --> 08:36:55,480
I was sure his honesty
was beyond a doubt.

4184
08:36:56,482 --> 08:37:00,693
But, as you see,
I'm now the victim of a swindle.

4185
08:37:01,695 --> 08:37:07,325
He's stalling me. Vast monies have
gone to people in high political places

4186
08:37:07,660 --> 08:37:10,578
and the Vatican Bank is the guarantor.

4187
08:37:10,663 --> 08:37:15,875
If what you say is true,
there will be a great scandal.

4188
08:37:18,045 --> 08:37:23,091
Look at this stone. It has been
in the water for a very long time,

4189
08:37:23,175 --> 08:37:26,928
but the water has not penetrated it.

4190
08:37:31,141 --> 08:37:32,433
Look...

4191
08:37:33,519 --> 08:37:38,648
Perfectly dry. The same thing
has happened to men in Europe.

4192
08:37:38,732 --> 08:37:42,860
For centuries they have been
surrounded by Christianity,

4193
08:37:43,696 --> 08:37:49,575
but Christ has not penetrated.
Christ doesn't live within them.

4194
08:37:53,706 --> 08:37:57,875
- What's happening?
- Could you get me something sweet?

4195
08:37:57,960 --> 08:38:01,296
Some orange juice, candy...

4196
08:38:05,050 --> 08:38:07,302
I have trouble with diabetes.

4197
08:38:11,015 --> 08:38:13,308
My blood sugar goes low.

4198
08:38:13,392 --> 08:38:15,226
I understand.

4199
08:38:38,500 --> 08:38:41,419
It happens sometimes
when I'm under stress.

4200
08:38:42,296 --> 08:38:43,921
I understand.

4201
08:38:46,008 --> 08:38:49,719
To come to you
on such a delicate matter...

4202
08:38:52,598 --> 08:38:57,143
Accusations against your Archbishop.
It was difficult for me.

4203
08:38:58,937 --> 08:39:00,646
The mind suffers

4204
08:39:01,148 --> 08:39:03,941
and the body cries out.

4205
08:39:10,115 --> 08:39:11,616
That's true.

4206
08:39:13,285 --> 08:39:17,080
Would you like to make
your confession?

4207
08:39:23,837 --> 08:39:25,713
Your Eminence, I'm...

4208
08:39:30,052 --> 08:39:35,473
It's been so long. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't know where to...

4209
08:39:37,017 --> 08:39:38,893
It's been 30 years.

4210
08:39:40,771 --> 08:39:43,481
I'd use up too much of your time, I think.

4211
08:39:44,400 --> 08:39:46,984
I always have time to save souls.

4212
08:39:48,570 --> 08:39:53,199
- Well, I'm beyond redemption.
- No, no...

4213
08:40:02,543 --> 08:40:06,295
I hear the confessions
of my own priests here.

4214
08:40:07,631 --> 08:40:11,175
Sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming,

4215
08:40:11,844 --> 08:40:14,220
and we must seize the moment.

4216
08:40:18,892 --> 08:40:22,562
What is the point of confessing
if I don't repent?

4217
08:40:25,149 --> 08:40:27,525
I hear you are a practical man.

4218
08:40:28,485 --> 08:40:30,528
What have you got to lose?

4219
08:40:42,374 --> 08:40:43,749
Go on.

4220
08:40:50,549 --> 08:40:51,716
I...

4221
08:40:53,135 --> 08:40:54,927
...betrayed my wife.

4222
08:40:56,722 --> 08:40:58,306
Go on, my son.

4223
08:41:03,979 --> 08:41:05,730
I betrayed myself.

4224
08:41:08,775 --> 08:41:10,318
I killed men.

4225
08:41:14,406 --> 08:41:16,866
And I ordered men to be killed.

4226
08:41:18,410 --> 08:41:20,453
Go on, my son. Go on.

4227
08:41:26,585 --> 08:41:28,169
It's useless.

4228
08:41:29,755 --> 08:41:31,422
Go on, my son.

4229
08:41:32,883 --> 08:41:34,342
I killed...

4230
08:41:39,431 --> 08:41:41,933
I ordered the death of my brother.

4231
08:41:43,101 --> 08:41:44,894
He injured me.

4232
08:41:46,522 --> 08:41:48,606
I killed my mother's son.

4233
08:41:50,442 --> 08:41:52,485
I killed my father's son.

4234
08:42:03,247 --> 08:42:07,625
Your sins are terrible,
and it is just that you suffer.

4235
08:42:09,253 --> 08:42:11,629
Your life could be redeemed,

4236
08:42:13,048 --> 08:42:16,884
but I know that you don't believe that.
You will not change.

4237
08:42:47,541 --> 08:42:52,503
<i>Pope Paul VI, Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church,...</i>

4238
08:42:52,838 --> 08:42:56,007
<i>died last night at 9:40 p. m.</i>

4239
08:42:56,508 --> 08:42:59,844
<i>The Pope was 81 years old,...</i>

4240
08:43:00,679 --> 08:43:04,265
<i>and had been in poor health
for the last several months.</i>

4241
08:43:09,146 --> 08:43:10,521
Connie...

4242
08:43:12,357 --> 08:43:16,736
All my life I've kept trying
to go up in society.

4243
08:43:17,446 --> 08:43:20,364
To where everything higher up
was legal, straight...

4244
08:43:22,451 --> 08:43:25,911
But the higher I go,
the more crooked it becomes.

4245
08:43:28,707 --> 08:43:30,875
Where the hell does it end?

4246
08:43:39,885 --> 08:43:43,304
They've been killing each other
for centuries here.

4247
08:43:44,723 --> 08:43:48,809
For money, for pride, for family.

4248
08:43:52,022 --> 08:43:56,025
<i>To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich pezzi da novanta.</i>

4249
08:44:03,116 --> 08:44:05,368
I made confession, Connie.

4250
08:44:06,370 --> 08:44:08,412
I confessed my sins.

4251
08:44:10,082 --> 08:44:15,169
Why? That's not like you. You don't
have to confess your sins to a stranger.

4252
08:44:16,088 --> 08:44:17,672
It was the man.

4253
08:44:18,715 --> 08:44:22,426
He's a good man. A true priest.

4254
08:44:26,598 --> 08:44:28,641
He can change things.

4255
08:44:30,894 --> 08:44:32,603
Michael...

4256
08:44:34,106 --> 08:44:37,983
You know,
sometimes I think of poor Fredo.

4257
08:44:38,819 --> 08:44:42,113
Drowned. It was God's will.

4258
08:44:44,658 --> 08:44:46,867
It was a terrible accident.

4259
08:44:48,286 --> 08:44:50,246
But it's finished.

4260
08:44:55,293 --> 08:44:57,128
Michael, I love you.

4261
08:44:59,506 --> 08:45:01,465
I'll always help you.

4262
08:45:13,729 --> 08:45:15,271
Oh, Connie...

4263
08:45:45,177 --> 08:45:52,183
I am honored, Don Altobello, that
you've come from Palermo to visit me.

4264
08:45:55,520 --> 08:46:00,524
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

4265
08:46:01,151 --> 08:46:02,985
Do the donkey for me.

4266
08:46:20,545 --> 08:46:24,632
It's been some time since we
did business together.

4267
08:46:28,595 --> 08:46:33,599
You are my "ace in the hole, "
as we say in America.

4268
08:46:33,683 --> 08:46:39,563
I have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

4269
08:46:46,822 --> 08:46:49,740
Only one stone?

4270
08:46:51,743 --> 08:46:57,706
It's dangerous. A famous man.

4271
08:46:57,958 --> 08:47:01,460
You will have to take precautions.

4272
08:47:04,256 --> 08:47:09,760
Tell me what to do.
Then I will tell you my price.

4273
08:47:13,974 --> 08:47:16,767
Ah, what bread!

4274
08:47:20,772 --> 08:47:24,942
Olive oil...

4275
08:47:28,113 --> 08:47:31,615
Virgin... only in Sicily.

4276
08:47:34,077 --> 08:47:35,327
<i>Alla salute!</i>

4277
08:47:35,412 --> 08:47:38,289
To death.

4278
08:47:51,803 --> 08:47:53,387
Kay!

4279
08:47:53,471 --> 08:47:55,806
- Connie!
- How are you?

4280
08:47:55,891 --> 08:47:58,976
Mary, I've missed you.

4281
08:47:59,477 --> 08:48:03,188
- Hello, Michael.
- Mom, look at this.

4282
08:48:07,277 --> 08:48:13,198
- It's too bad Douglas couldn't come.
- I know. He had a very important trial.

4283
08:48:13,283 --> 08:48:15,326
I know he wanted to come.

4284
08:48:16,494 --> 08:48:18,495
- The car is...
- Okay.

4285
08:48:20,498 --> 08:48:26,670
- Well, your son is an artist.
- Oh, yes. Thanks to you.

4286
08:48:27,339 --> 08:48:31,675
- What for?
- For making me let him go.

4287
08:48:32,344 --> 08:48:37,389
Well, after all these years,
here I am in Sicily for the first time.

4288
08:48:37,515 --> 08:48:40,684
- I want to get a picture of you together.
- Okay.

4289
08:48:42,604 --> 08:48:44,355
Hey, Dad. Smile!

4290
08:48:48,860 --> 08:48:51,737
I see you still have Al Neri. Why?

4291
08:48:53,031 --> 08:48:56,617
I need him. He helps me
get in and out of the car.

4292
08:48:57,786 --> 08:49:01,538
- He carries my briefcase.
- You're still a liar, Michael.

4293
08:49:02,791 --> 08:49:08,045
Let me show you Sicily, the real Sicily.
So you'll understand the family history.

4294
08:49:09,130 --> 08:49:11,966
I think I understand
it well enough.

4295
08:50:03,601 --> 08:50:09,565
Anthony, I have something you made
for me a very long time ago.

4296
08:50:11,276 --> 08:50:14,069
- Might bring you luck.
- Thanks.

4297
08:50:18,283 --> 08:50:21,535
You saved it... I remember.

4298
08:50:25,540 --> 08:50:27,124
Thank you, Dad.

4299
08:50:28,710 --> 08:50:30,461
I'm proud of you.

4300
08:50:31,212 --> 08:50:32,755
Thank you.

4301
08:50:49,064 --> 08:50:51,857
- Are they as good as they look?
- Better.

4302
08:50:51,941 --> 08:50:56,361
They're the best. As long as they are
around, Uncle Michael is safe.

4303
08:50:57,030 --> 08:50:58,655
Goodbye.

4304
08:51:01,242 --> 08:51:04,453
- Tell your father I'll be back for dinner.
- Okay.

4305
08:51:04,954 --> 08:51:07,581
- Have fun.
- Tell Tony to wait for me.

4306
08:51:07,665 --> 08:51:09,124
I will.

4307
08:51:11,628 --> 08:51:15,214
<i>Buongiorno, signora. Atyour service.</i>

4308
08:51:19,177 --> 08:51:22,054
If I see Dad, I'll tell him you left.

4309
08:51:27,560 --> 08:51:31,230
You're the only one left
with my father's strength.

4310
08:51:33,483 --> 08:51:37,361
If anything happens to Michael,
I want you to strike back.

4311
08:51:40,323 --> 08:51:42,491
I'll have everything ready.

4312
08:51:45,912 --> 08:51:47,663
Do you swear?

4313
08:51:54,963 --> 08:51:56,547
I swear to you.

4314
08:52:26,995 --> 08:52:28,662
Here it is.

4315
08:52:30,456 --> 08:52:33,083
The house where my father was born.

4316
08:52:34,169 --> 08:52:39,590
This is where they came to take him
when he was a boy. To kill him.

4317
08:52:42,969 --> 08:52:44,761
Wait...

4318
08:52:45,263 --> 08:52:47,181
Listen to that.

4319
08:53:06,367 --> 08:53:08,368
You know Mary's in love.

4320
08:53:09,871 --> 08:53:11,496
Yes, I know.

4321
08:53:12,707 --> 08:53:16,543
With a handsome young Italian man
with dark eyes...

4322
08:53:18,004 --> 08:53:19,838
I won't allow it.

4323
08:53:22,634 --> 08:53:26,261
It's wrong.
It's wrong and it's dangerous.

4324
08:53:26,471 --> 08:53:29,473
"Oh father, my father!"

4325
08:53:30,141 --> 08:53:32,517
"Give me some time to pray
to the Lord. "

4326
08:53:33,645 --> 08:53:36,730
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

4327
08:53:37,315 --> 08:53:40,108
and fallen in love with her cousin.

4328
08:53:40,485 --> 08:53:42,486
"There will be no forgiveness!"

4329
08:53:42,570 --> 08:53:46,156
Her father stabbed her through
the heart.

4330
08:53:58,670 --> 08:54:00,170
Honor, huh?

4331
08:54:19,816 --> 08:54:22,776
I remember the time you came
to my parents' house

4332
08:54:22,860 --> 08:54:26,446
and told me about the family business.

4333
08:54:26,531 --> 08:54:31,535
How you'd never have anything
to do with it. You sounded like Tony.

4334
08:54:32,620 --> 08:54:34,621
I was a lot like Tony.

4335
08:54:42,213 --> 08:54:45,090
- I can barely see him... Kay?
- What?

4336
08:54:45,174 --> 08:54:47,843
- Do you mind driving?
- What's wrong?

4337
08:54:47,927 --> 08:54:50,887
My eyes.
Sometimes they're all right, but...

4338
08:54:52,640 --> 08:54:54,975
I have to see Don Tommasino...

4339
08:54:58,646 --> 08:55:00,063
Well...

4340
08:55:01,316 --> 08:55:04,735
- There are no bodyguards today.
- I really snuck away.

4341
08:55:11,909 --> 08:55:16,288
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

4342
08:55:25,423 --> 08:55:29,676
I know you. You're Mosca
of Montelepre.

4343
08:55:30,803 --> 08:55:34,639
You were an assassin then
and you're an assassin now.

4344
08:55:34,932 --> 08:55:38,268
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

4345
08:55:38,603 --> 08:55:40,854
I will pass through the gates
with you.

4346
08:55:57,830 --> 08:55:59,623
How are you?

4347
08:55:59,707 --> 08:56:03,293
This is Calo, one of my bodyguards
in the old days.

4348
08:56:09,133 --> 08:56:11,718
- We can wait here.
- You want a drink?

4349
08:56:17,141 --> 08:56:20,018
I spent a lot of time in this room...

4350
08:56:21,145 --> 08:56:23,146
...thinking of you.

4351
08:56:26,150 --> 08:56:28,318
And then you got married.

4352
08:56:31,906 --> 08:56:35,325
- I still thought of you.
- What's in that room?

4353
08:56:40,123 --> 08:56:43,667
This is dangerous for you. This is Sicily.

4354
08:56:46,754 --> 08:56:49,172
- I love this country.
- Why?

4355
08:56:51,676 --> 08:56:57,681
Well, all through history, terrible things
have happened to these people.

4356
08:56:58,683 --> 08:57:00,892
Terrible injustices.

4357
08:57:01,769 --> 08:57:06,648
But they still expect good,
rather than bad, will happen to them.

4358
08:57:07,191 --> 08:57:09,526
Sort of like me and you?

4359
08:57:13,406 --> 08:57:16,074
- How so?
- I'm still here, right?

4360
08:57:17,034 --> 08:57:20,120
We do have a bad history,
but I'm still here.

4361
08:57:20,204 --> 08:57:22,914
Yes, you are, but with dread.

4362
08:57:27,837 --> 08:57:29,588
Give me the order!

4363
08:57:30,047 --> 08:57:33,175
Is that supposed to make me
not dread you?

4364
08:57:35,386 --> 08:57:37,637
We're in Sicily. It's opera.

4365
08:57:40,224 --> 08:57:41,683
Okay.

4366
08:57:44,312 --> 08:57:46,062
What do we do now?

4367
08:57:48,816 --> 08:57:52,694
Be reasonable.
Let's try not to hurt each other.

4368
08:58:00,578 --> 08:58:02,579
I want you to forgive me.

4369
08:58:05,416 --> 08:58:08,335
- For what?
- Everything.

4370
08:58:12,048 --> 08:58:14,174
Oh, like God?

4371
08:58:16,052 --> 08:58:18,678
No, I need something a little closer.

4372
08:58:21,599 --> 08:58:24,768
You couldn't understand,
back in those days.

4373
08:58:26,229 --> 08:58:31,107
I loved my father. I swore I would
never be a man like him,

4374
08:58:31,192 --> 08:58:34,986
but I loved him and he was in danger.
What could I do?

4375
08:58:35,655 --> 08:58:38,406
And then later, you were in danger.

4376
08:58:39,283 --> 08:58:42,619
Our children were in danger.
What could I do?

4377
08:58:43,663 --> 08:58:48,917
You were all that I... loved and valued
most in the world.

4378
08:58:51,337 --> 08:58:53,922
Now I'm losing you. I lost you.

4379
08:58:54,674 --> 08:58:56,508
You're gone.

4380
08:58:57,760 --> 08:59:00,554
And it was all for nothing. So...

4381
08:59:05,268 --> 08:59:10,313
You have to understand,
I had a whole different destiny planned.

4382
08:59:13,901 --> 08:59:15,777
All right, I'll stop.

4383
08:59:26,289 --> 08:59:30,208
I really don't know what you
want from me, Michael.

4384
08:59:30,668 --> 08:59:34,838
- I mean...
- I'm not the man that you think I am.

4385
08:59:36,674 --> 08:59:40,010
- I don't know.
- I love you, Kay.

4386
08:59:42,054 --> 08:59:44,014
Don't dread me anymore.

4387
08:59:49,770 --> 08:59:53,690
You know, every night here in Sicily...

4388
08:59:55,860 --> 09:00:00,822
...I dream about my wife
and my children...

4389
09:00:04,327 --> 09:00:06,286
...and how I lost them.

4390
09:00:08,539 --> 09:00:14,210
I guess that if it's any consolation,
I want you to know that...

4391
09:00:17,715 --> 09:00:19,132
...that...

4392
09:00:20,217 --> 09:00:22,552
...I always loved you, Michael.

4393
09:00:24,055 --> 09:00:25,764
And you know...

4394
09:00:27,600 --> 09:00:29,976
...always, I always will.

4395
09:00:58,589 --> 09:01:00,924
What is it? What's wrong?

4396
09:01:01,133 --> 09:01:03,927
They found Don Tommasino shot.

4397
09:01:05,262 --> 09:01:07,472
Is he dead?

4398
09:01:09,225 --> 09:01:12,769
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

4399
09:01:13,396 --> 09:01:16,231
I must have revenge!

4400
09:01:20,027 --> 09:01:25,240
Some day, you may have to do
a difficult service for me.

4401
09:01:25,449 --> 09:01:27,033
Command me.

4402
09:01:28,953 --> 09:01:30,036
It never ends.

4403
09:01:30,121 --> 09:01:32,330
I will avenge him!

4404
09:01:47,513 --> 09:01:48,972
Totals...

4405
09:01:50,975 --> 09:01:53,351
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

4406
09:01:54,019 --> 09:01:57,063
Siri, 11 votes.

4407
09:01:57,732 --> 09:02:00,817
Lamberto, 99 votes.

4408
09:02:06,323 --> 09:02:11,661
Do you accept your election
as supreme pontiff?

4409
09:02:12,288 --> 09:02:18,042
Oh God, shed light on the decision
they have taken on my behalf.

4410
09:02:18,919 --> 09:02:20,628
I accept.

4411
09:02:20,796 --> 09:02:23,423
By what name do you
wish to be called?

4412
09:02:23,716 --> 09:02:26,718
John Paul the First.

4413
09:02:56,373 --> 09:03:01,252
I will do things "right away, "
rather than in "a little while"...

4414
09:03:03,380 --> 09:03:08,676
<i>Frederick Keinszig, known as "God's
Banker", has been reported missing.</i>

4415
09:03:08,761 --> 09:03:15,517
<i>He was last seen leaving the Rome
offices of Vatican owned Immobiliare.</i>

4416
09:03:16,352 --> 09:03:19,813
<i>Also missing was a large sum
of money and several documents.</i>

4417
09:03:21,315 --> 09:03:23,399
Keinszig, you fool.

4418
09:03:26,904 --> 09:03:31,825
<i>His absence casts further suspicion
on the dealings of the Vatican Bank.</i>

4419
09:03:31,909 --> 09:03:34,619
<i>For several years,
the bank and its companies</i>

4420
09:03:34,703 --> 09:03:38,957
<i>have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices.</i>

4421
09:03:40,167 --> 09:03:44,295
Lucchesi, will you please
try to understand?

4422
09:03:45,756 --> 09:03:50,009
I have phoned him.
I have waited here by the phone.

4423
09:03:52,638 --> 09:03:56,182
<i>You would do well to remember,
Mr. Lucchesi,</i>

4424
09:03:57,059 --> 09:04:03,731
that this Pope has very different ideas
from the last one.

4425
09:04:25,963 --> 09:04:27,964
Goodbye, my old friend.

4426
09:04:30,676 --> 09:04:33,428
You could have lived a little longer.

4427
09:04:34,305 --> 09:04:36,806
I could be closer to my dream.

4428
09:04:43,147 --> 09:04:45,690
You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

4429
09:04:50,529 --> 09:04:54,240
Why was I so feared, and you so loved?

4430
09:04:55,492 --> 09:04:57,076
What was it?

4431
09:04:58,287 --> 09:05:00,496
I was no less honorable.

4432
09:05:02,583 --> 09:05:04,417
I wanted to do good.

4433
09:05:08,547 --> 09:05:11,507
What betrayed me? My mind? My heart?

4434
09:05:14,553 --> 09:05:17,013
Why do I condemn myself so?

4435
09:05:23,562 --> 09:05:25,313
I swear,

4436
09:05:25,731 --> 09:05:28,024
on the lives of my children...

4437
09:05:32,529 --> 09:05:35,198
Give me a chance to redeem myself...

4438
09:05:39,203 --> 09:05:42,830
...and I will sin no more.

4439
09:06:07,064 --> 09:06:10,942
You look pale. Bad news?
Tell me right away.

4440
09:06:13,070 --> 09:06:15,571
It's not just a bad banking deal.

4441
09:06:16,573 --> 09:06:18,700
These guys are butchers.

4442
09:06:19,910 --> 09:06:22,578
- What guys?
- Lucchesi.

4443
09:06:24,415 --> 09:06:28,251
He controls all of them:
Altobello, the Archbishop...

4444
09:06:30,087 --> 09:06:32,714
...others higher up, P2 maybe.

4445
09:06:32,798 --> 09:06:35,883
Secret unknown. They're running things.

4446
09:06:39,638 --> 09:06:44,434
- I'm in their way.
- He's hired an assassin to kill you.

4447
09:06:45,102 --> 09:06:47,729
A Sicilian. I don't know his name.

4448
09:06:49,857 --> 09:06:52,025
But they say he never fails.

4449
09:06:53,277 --> 09:06:55,445
Then no one is safe.

4450
09:06:58,282 --> 09:07:00,616
Even the new Pope is in danger.

4451
09:07:01,702 --> 09:07:04,787
We still have time. We can prevent this.

4452
09:07:10,210 --> 09:07:12,545
I tried, Vincent.

4453
09:07:14,715 --> 09:07:16,215
I tried...

4454
09:07:17,551 --> 09:07:21,971
...to keep everything from coming
to this. But it's not possible.

4455
09:07:23,515 --> 09:07:25,308
Not in this world.

4456
09:07:26,894 --> 09:07:28,644
Give me the order.

4457
09:07:32,483 --> 09:07:34,817
You won't be able to go back.

4458
09:07:35,861 --> 09:07:37,987
- You'll be like me.
- Good.

4459
09:07:39,740 --> 09:07:41,783
All my life I wanted out.

4460
09:07:42,493 --> 09:07:44,494
I wanted the family out.

4461
09:07:46,663 --> 09:07:48,498
I don't want out.

4462
09:07:48,957 --> 09:07:51,709
I want the power to preserve the family.

4463
09:07:56,423 --> 09:07:58,674
I'm asking for the order.

4464
09:08:19,613 --> 09:08:21,239
It's done.

4465
09:08:22,699 --> 09:08:25,034
Because I can't do it anymore.

4466
09:08:29,248 --> 09:08:32,834
Well, it doesn't matter.
Vincent knows what to do.

4467
09:08:32,918 --> 09:08:37,922
Come on outside.
Take a rest and don't think about it.

4468
09:08:38,298 --> 09:08:41,217
- All I do is think about it.
- I'm your son.

4469
09:08:42,386 --> 09:08:44,512
Command me in all things.

4470
09:08:46,849 --> 09:08:48,724
Give up my daughter.

4471
09:08:51,812 --> 09:08:53,980
That's the price you pay...

4472
09:08:55,107 --> 09:08:57,233
...for the life you choose.

4473
09:09:23,468 --> 09:09:25,052
Nephew...

4474
09:09:27,472 --> 09:09:29,557
...from this moment on...

4475
09:09:30,934 --> 09:09:33,436
...call yourself Vincent Corleone.

4476
09:09:38,275 --> 09:09:39,483
Sit.

4477
09:09:54,708 --> 09:09:56,292
Don Vincenzo...

4478
09:10:02,299 --> 09:10:04,008
Don Corleone...

4479
09:10:07,512 --> 09:10:09,639
Don Vincenzo Corleone...

4480
09:11:43,442 --> 09:11:45,818
<i>E tu, Vincenzo...</i>

4481
09:11:45,902 --> 09:11:50,531
I know how you feel about Michael,
but you can't save him.

4482
09:11:51,408 --> 09:11:52,825
He's lost.

4483
09:11:54,494 --> 09:11:56,370
Think of yourself.

4484
09:11:57,331 --> 09:12:00,082
What's your answer, Vincent?

4485
09:12:01,585 --> 09:12:03,336
Enjoy the opera.

4486
09:12:05,422 --> 09:12:07,423
It's all taken care of.

4487
09:12:13,055 --> 09:12:15,848
Check the bar. I'll check the top floor.

4488
09:12:19,686 --> 09:12:24,023
"Here's hoping Tony sings better at the
Teatro Massimo than in the shower.

4489
09:12:24,107 --> 09:12:26,359
"Love, Douglas. "

4490
09:12:26,443 --> 09:12:29,862
- My darling Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

4491
09:12:30,781 --> 09:12:33,824
- This is a great occasion.
- Come, sit down.

4492
09:12:38,497 --> 09:12:42,917
Happy birthday.
You're 80, but don't look more than 60.

4493
09:12:43,001 --> 09:12:45,503
You're the only one who remembered.

4494
09:12:45,587 --> 09:12:47,254
We've just got the word.

4495
09:12:47,339 --> 09:12:50,758
The Pope has ratified
the Immobiliare deal. We've won.

4496
09:12:50,842 --> 09:12:52,551
Congratulations.

4497
09:12:55,389 --> 09:12:57,640
Strange how things work.

4498
09:12:57,724 --> 09:13:01,811
The Pope is doing what you
said he'd do. He's cleaning house.

4499
09:13:02,896 --> 09:13:06,690
He should be careful.
It's dangerous to be an honest man.

4500
09:13:12,948 --> 09:13:16,033
I want to put more muscle backstage
with Tony.

4501
09:13:28,088 --> 09:13:31,340
On your birthday you used to
shower me with treats.

4502
09:13:31,425 --> 09:13:33,300
Tootsie Rolls!

4503
09:13:34,177 --> 09:13:39,640
The nuns who made this cannoli took a
vow of silence. They're the very finest.

4504
09:13:43,478 --> 09:13:46,230
- Hey.
- Hey, cous.

4505
09:13:48,275 --> 09:13:51,026
Hi. Where's your leather?

4506
09:13:55,198 --> 09:13:56,740
Stop it.

4507
09:14:02,706 --> 09:14:05,916
You're so thin. You eat it.

4508
09:14:22,601 --> 09:14:23,934
<i>?buono.</i>

4509
09:14:24,478 --> 09:14:26,729
<i>Grazie!</i>

4510
09:14:29,691 --> 09:14:33,986
It's over. There are things I have to do
that you can't be part of.

4511
09:14:34,070 --> 09:14:36,989
It's not your father's decision, it's mine.

4512
09:14:38,909 --> 09:14:40,993
Don't hate your father.

4513
09:14:43,246 --> 09:14:47,082
There are things I'll be part of
that you can't be around.

4514
09:14:48,835 --> 09:14:51,587
After tonight,
you won't see me anymore.

4515
09:14:55,926 --> 09:14:59,595
You've got to understand, Mary.
You've got to understand.

4516
09:15:00,597 --> 09:15:02,264
I'll always love you.

4517
09:15:15,445 --> 09:15:17,279
Love somebody else.

4518
09:18:58,460 --> 09:19:02,421
- They won't try anything.
- Everything's fine. It's all clear.

4519
09:19:02,505 --> 09:19:05,340
I've already sent Al Neri to the Vatican.

4520
09:19:17,812 --> 09:19:20,355
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

4521
09:19:20,440 --> 09:19:21,440
Yes.

4522
09:19:21,941 --> 09:19:26,153
I bring a message from
Michael Corleone.

4523
09:19:27,530 --> 09:19:28,947
Let him in.

4524
09:20:58,079 --> 09:20:59,955
<i>Buona sera.</i>

4525
09:24:21,032 --> 09:24:22,908
Good. You got him.

4526
09:25:15,169 --> 09:25:18,588
<i>Tonight the Corleone family
settles its accounts.</i>

4527
09:25:18,923 --> 09:25:23,468
<i>Keinszig...
That little Swiss banker fuck.</i>

4528
09:25:24,720 --> 09:25:28,515
<i>He's been swindling everyone
from the beginning. Fuck him.</i>

4529
09:25:30,309 --> 09:25:32,936
<i>Don Lucchesi, my friend.</i>

4530
09:25:33,020 --> 09:25:35,689
<i>Calo will pay him a visit at his home.</i>

4531
09:25:38,359 --> 09:25:41,778
<i>Neri, take a train to Rome.</i>

4532
09:25:43,239 --> 09:25:45,782
<i>Light a candle for the Archbishop.</i>

4533
09:26:20,193 --> 09:26:23,653
Tea, Your Holiness? It will help
you sleep.

4534
09:26:47,303 --> 09:26:50,305
This is from Vincent Corleone.

4535
09:27:48,489 --> 09:27:53,451
It's serious. Our man inside the Vatican
says there's a plot against the Pope.

4536
09:27:53,536 --> 09:27:55,704
He'll have a heart attack?

4537
09:28:02,878 --> 09:28:08,091
This Pope has powerful enemies.
We may not be in time to save him.

4538
09:28:11,053 --> 09:28:12,637
Let's go back.

4539
09:28:47,214 --> 09:28:48,840
<i>Eminenza...</i>

4540
09:29:04,523 --> 09:29:07,150
The Holy Father is dead!

4541
09:30:37,658 --> 09:30:39,117
Sleep.

4542
09:30:39,952 --> 09:30:41,703
Sleep, Godfather.

4543
09:30:57,344 --> 09:30:59,012
Our friend's dead.

4544
09:31:51,857 --> 09:31:53,942
Speak... tell me.

4545
09:31:55,361 --> 09:32:01,783
You have lost the
faith of the people.

4546
09:32:03,077 --> 09:32:07,580
He who builds on the people
builds on mud.

4547
09:32:07,957 --> 09:32:11,793
And Michael Corleone's message?

4548
09:32:28,561 --> 09:32:35,066
It's very important.
I must whisper it in your ear.

4549
09:32:38,862 --> 09:32:40,863
He's clean.

4550
09:32:59,341 --> 09:33:02,135
Power wears out those
who don't have it.

4551
09:34:30,849 --> 09:34:34,185
- I like this outfit.
- I figured you would.

4552
09:34:34,269 --> 09:34:35,937
Say hello.

4553
09:34:57,960 --> 09:35:01,879
- Can I talk to you now?
- No, it's not a good time.

4554
09:35:01,964 --> 09:35:05,758
- You're just like my father.
- Stay with the family. Go on.

4555
09:35:07,469 --> 09:35:09,303
- Talk to me.
- The twins are dead.

4556
09:35:09,388 --> 09:35:13,558
In about one minute, there will be
carabinieri all over this place.

4557
09:35:14,435 --> 09:35:17,311
Get everybody to the cars, quietly.

4558
09:35:17,396 --> 09:35:19,021
- Got it.
- Quiet.

4559
09:35:33,704 --> 09:35:37,290
The name Corleone
will be associated with a voice.

4560
09:35:46,675 --> 09:35:48,009
Dad...

4561
09:36:07,696 --> 09:36:11,616
Dad... Why are you doing this to me?

4562
09:36:20,709 --> 09:36:23,294
Move back, move back.

4563
09:36:24,671 --> 09:36:28,758
- You don't have to do this to me.
- Do what? What do you mean?

4564
09:36:55,202 --> 09:36:56,452
Dad...

4565
09:37:13,554 --> 09:37:15,513
No! Mary!

4566
09:37:18,767 --> 09:37:20,184
God, no!
