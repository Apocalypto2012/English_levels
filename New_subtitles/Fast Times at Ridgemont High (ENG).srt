00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,290


2
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,750
<i> See the people
walking down the street</i>

3
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,050
<i> Fall in line
just watching all their feet</i>

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,490
<i> They don't know
where they want to go</i>

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,080
<i> But they're walking in time</i>

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,130
<i> They got the beat
They got the beat</i>

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,760
<i> They got the beat, yeah
They got the beat</i>

8
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,570
<i> All the kids
just gettin' out of school</i>

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,810
<i> They can't wait
to hang out and be cool</i>

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,180
<i> Hang around 'til quarter after 12:00
That's when they fall in line</i>

11
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,690
<i> They got the beat
They got the beat</i>

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,990
<i> Kids got the beat, yeah
Kids got the beat</i>

13
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,920
<i> Go-go music
really makes us dance</i>

14
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,920
<i> Do the Pony
puts us in a trance</i>

15
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,860
<i> Do the Watusi, just give us a chance
That's when we fall in line</i>

16
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,690
<i> 'Cause we got the beat
We got the beat</i>

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,130
<i> We got the beat, yeah
We got it</i>

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,700
<i> We got the beat</i>

19
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,770
<i> We got the beat</i>

20
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,270
<i> We got the beat
Everybody, get on your feet</i>

21
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,780
<i> We got the beat
We know you can dance to the beat</i>

22
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,790
<i> We got the beat
Jump back, get down</i>

23
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,290
<i> 'Round and 'round and 'round</i>

24
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,030
<i> We got the beat</i>

25
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,530
Linda, there's that guy
from the stereo store.

26
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,900
- Don't you think
he looks like Richard Gere?
- See his cute little butt?

27
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,340
- You guys, let's talk about
that fox that just walked in.
- We already were.

28
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,840
I'm gonna go over there
and change the shakers.

29
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,400
- Cool out. That's Stacy's section.
- He's too old.

30
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,970
She's not even
in high school yet.

31
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,880
Smoking's upstairs to your left.

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,480
Smoking's upstairs to your left.

33
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,080
Smoking's upstairs.

34
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,320
Rat, is Dolly Parton giving you
a percentage of the profit?

35
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,420
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

36
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,760
You the guy with
the Van Halen tickets?

37
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,800
That could be.

38
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,960
How much for something
in the first ten rows?

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,030
- Twenty bucks apiece.
- Those tickets were only $12.50.

40
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,010
So don't buy 'em.

41
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,170
All the other scalpers are sold out.

42
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,300
Scalper?
Did you call me a scalper?

43
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,440
Listen, gentlemen, I perform a service
here, and the service costs money.

44
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,780
Do you want the tickets or don't you?

45
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,790
Okay, we'll take 'em.

46
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,690
All right.
What'd I say, $25?

47
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,230
Twenty!

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,400
All right.
Thank you.

49
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,530
Just made 16 bucks, Rat.
What's the matter? You look depressed.

50
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,060
I hate working the theater. All the
action's on the other side of the mall.

51
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,510
- How's it going?
- You want to take his table?

52
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,380
Go for it.
He's cute.

53
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,940
Just take his order,
look him in the eye.

54
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,220
If he says anything remotely funny,
laugh like you never heard anything
so funny.

55
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,230
And smile!

56
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,230
Go for it.

57
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,110
So, you working hard or hardly working?

58
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,610
 You look like you
could still be in high school.

59
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,270
I know.
Everybody says that.

60
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,940
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

61
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,080
- How old are you?
- Twenty-six.

62
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,210
Do you think we could
still be friends?

63
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,460
So what can I get you?

64
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,620
How 'bout a meatball sandwich,

65
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,530
a medium Coke,
and your phone number?

66
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,980
- Hi.
- Hello.

67
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,020
Get outta here, Bradley.

68
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,050
- Dave.
- How you doin', Brad?

69
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,350
Cookin'!

70
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,480
Daddy's home, boys.

71
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,930
 I shall serve no fries
before their time.

72
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,730
This one's on you, dude.
Who's got the beaucoup dolares today?

73
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,640
Uno dinero.

74
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,670
- What have you got, Mr. Buck Man?
- I got a cigarette.

75
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,510
I got uno "nickelette."

76
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,520
Hey! You guys had shirts on
when you came in here.

77
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,150
Somethin' happened to 'em, man.

78
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,090
Come on, Spicoli,
just put the shirts back on.

79
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,250
You see that sign?

80
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,630
"No shirts. No shoes. No dice."

81
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,670
Right.

82
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,300
Learn it.
Know it. Live it.

83
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,510
- Whoa.
- He's the full hot orator.

84
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,310
Linda, did I show you this?
He gave me his card.

85
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,510
"Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant."

86
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,950
Maybe we should get a frame for this,
and put it up on the wall.

87
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,550
Linda, you're the one who told me
I was gonna get a boyfriend at the mall.

88
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,720
- Do you think he'll call this week?
- Why don't you call him?

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,460
- I can't.
- You can. Guys love that sort of thing.

90
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,870
- Really?
- Yes!

91
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,840
Stacy, what are you waiting for?
You're 15 years old.

92
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,340
I did it when I was 13.
It's no huge thing. It's just sex.

93
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,570
- He was hot, wasn't he?
- If I didn't have a fiance
in Chicago, I'd go for it.

94
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,150
Hey, how you doin'?
Welcome to Ridgemont.

95
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,190
Will it look okay?

96
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,770
<i>Well, she was an American girl</i>

97
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,440
<i> Raised on promises</i>

98
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,570
- Do you know where U.S. History is?
- Down the hall and turn left.

99
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,280
<i> Somewhere else</i>

100
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,310
<i> She was an American girl</i>

101
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,070
Hi, Bradley.

102
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,700
Grown up.
Lookin' good.

103
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,750
Another year joined at the lips.

104
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,880
- Hi, Brad!
- Denise. I'd make you see God.

105
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,890
Brad!

106
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,660
- Big Cruising Vessel!
- Bradley!

107
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,730
Thank you.

108
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,330
Six more payments, gentlemen,
and this beautiful...

109
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,930
blue, four-door, luxury sedan
is all mine!

110
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,240
 I'll give you
four tickets in the fifth row...

111
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,180
for the low price of $140.

112
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,610
See that car? Some alumni
gave Jefferson that car...

113
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,650
for playing football
when he was a sophomore.

114
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,620
- Helped him pick it out.
- Slick car.

115
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,550
We go way back, you know.

116
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,330
Hey, Charles, how you doin', buddy?
Car looks great. I mean really terrific.

117
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,060
You're really keeping it up
wonderfully.

118
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,930
Don't fuck with it!

119
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,670
Shit!
That's my man.

120
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,210
Brad?

121
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,980
- Arnold! What's happening?
- Can I talk to you a minute?

122
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,990
Sure, man.

123
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,850
I really hate Bronco Burger.

124
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,720
Ever since they started with the chicken
nuggets, everything went downhill.

125
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,700
You have to fry all their greasy food,
and you have to polish things.

126
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,220
And the manager's an asshole.
I was just wondering...

127
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,500
Arnold, do you want to work
at All-American Burger?

128
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,700
Yeah, well, um...

129
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,540
I can probably get you in.
Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.

130
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,410
- All right!
- Okay.

131
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,810

132
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,810
Wait.
Did you hear the bell ring?

133
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,910
- What bell?
- We're here.

134
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,190

135
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,370
Aloha.

136
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,130
My name is Mr. Hand.

137
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,570
I have but one question for you.

138
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,550
Can you attend my class?

139
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,050
It is for your own good. And if you
can't make it, I can make you.

140
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,580
We have a 20-question quiz every Friday.

141
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,590
Your grade is the average
of all your quizzes,

142
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,630
plus the midterm and final
which counts for one-third.

143
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,460
Got it?

144
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,500
Also...

145
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,930
There will be no eating. E-A-T-l-N-G.

146
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,970
No eating in this class!

147
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,610
You get used to doing
your own business on your own time.

148
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,210
That's one demand I make.

149
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,450
Just like you wouldn't want me
to come to your house...

150
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,150
- and discuss U.S. History
on your time, understand?
- Yes, sir.

151
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,450

152
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,490
This guy's been stoned
since the third grade.

153
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,370
- Yes?
- Yeah, I'm registered in this class.

154
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,730
- What class?
- This is U.S. History.

155
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,700
- I see the globe right there.
- Really?

156
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,570
Hey.
May I come in?

157
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,130
Oh, please!

158
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,670
I get so lonely when I hear
that third attendance bell ring...

159
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,840
and all my kids are not here.

160
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,790
Sorry, I'm late. It's just like
this new schedule's totally confusing.

161
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,450
I know that dude!

162
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,860
Mr. Spicoli.

163
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,090
That's the name they gave me.

164
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,730
- You're ripping my card!
- Yes.

165
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,260
Hey, bud, what's your problem?

166
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,310
No problem at all.

167
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,280
I think you know
where the front office is.

168
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,010
You dick!

169
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,520
I have taken the time
to print up a complete schedule...

170
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,150
of class quizzes
and the chapters they cover.

171
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,020
Please pass them
to the desk behind you.

172
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,650
Back, back, back.

173
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,060


174
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,540
Did you hear about this surfer guy
who pulled a knife on Mr. Hand
this morning?

175
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,410
Oh, no!
He just called him a dick.

176
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,310
A dick? Oh, God.
People exaggerate so much here.

177
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,490
Linda, that girl
looks just like Pat Benatar.

178
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,220
I know. Wait.
There are three girls at Ridgemont...

179
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,520
who have cultivated
the Pat Benatar look.

180
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,720
Chanel Semlar,

181
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,660
Mary Ann Zlotnick
in the red tights.

182
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,760
Do you think guys find that
more attractive?

183
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,500
Stacy, please, give me a break!
You are so much prettier!

184
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,010
Yeah, I know, but do you think
they'd be better in bed?

185
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,700
What do you mean?
You either do it or you don't.

186
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,220
No. There are like... variables
that I might not be good at.

187
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,550
- Like what variables?
- Like, you know, giving blow jobs.

188
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,250
What's the big deal?

189
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,890
- I never did it.
- You've never given a blow job?

190
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,460
Never? Stace, there's nothing to it.
It's so easy.

191
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,600
Check it out.

192
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,770
Relax your throat muscles.

193
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,180
Don't bite.

194
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,880
And slide it in.

195
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,790


196
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,880
Try it again.

197
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,160
Good. Push it slowly in and out.
You got it.

198
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,360
Okay.

199
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,200
- Can I ask you something
and you promise not to laugh?
- Sure.

200
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,770
Okay. When a guy has an orgasm,
how much comes out?

201
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,570
A quart or so.

202
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,940
No, I'm just kidding.

203
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,310
Just practice.

204
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,790
 I'm not going to a morgue.
I'll get my mom to write a note.

205
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,060
Nobody's getting me into a room
with a bunch of dead guys.

206
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,230
You have to go.
I hear it's part of the final.

207
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,070
I hear it's really disgusting.
Do you know what they do?

208
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,730
- Have you heard?
- What?

209
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,170
The bodies are dissected
and Mr. Vargas...

210
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,470
pulls out parts of the dead body
and holds them up.

211
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,880
You mean, he reaches in
and pulls this stuff out?

212
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,180
- Like stomach and tumors or something?
- Yeah, stomach, tumors, entrails.

213
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,710
Good day, everyone.
My name is Mr. Vargas.

214
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,690
Look.
I'm a little slow today.

215
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,660
I just switched to Sanka,
so have a heart.

216
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,000
All right, now.

217
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,030
The World of Life. That is the name
of the textbook we will be using.

218
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,070
I'm in love.

219
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,010
See the mustache comin' in, Rat?

220
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,380
You can almost cross it out.

221
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,080
- I'm in love.
- You are a wuss. Part wimp, part pussy.

222
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,560
What do you mean wuss?
This girl is my... exact type.

223
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,320
- Where'd you see her?
- In my biology class.

224
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,520
- Did you get her number?
- No.

225
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,330
- Did you get her name?
- No! No! It's too soon.

226
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,390
It's never too soon, Rat.

227
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,370
A girl decides how far she's gonna
let you go in the first five minutes.

228
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,380
What am I supposed to do? Go up to
this strange girl in my biology class...

229
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,240
and say, "Hello. I'd like you to
take your clothes off and jump on me"?

230
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,110
I would.

231
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,350
I can see it all now. This is
gonna be just like last summer.

232
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,410
You fell in love
with that girl at the Fotomat.

233
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,750
You bought $40 worth of fuckin' film,
and you never even talked to her.

234
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,730
You don't even own a camera!

235
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,920
You tell me, Mike.
What should I do?

236
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,590
This is what you do.

237
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,860
Start from the minute
you walk into biology.

238
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,770
I mean, don't just walk in.
Move across the room.

239
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,430
And you don't talk to her.

240
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,770
You use your face.
You use your body.

241
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,370
Use everything.

242
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,920
That's what I do.

243
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,210
I mean, I just send out
this vibe...

244
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,780
and I have personally found
that women do respond.

245
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,320
I mean, something happens.

246
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,550
Naturally something happens.

247
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,560
You put the vibe out to 30 million
chicks, something is gonna happen.

248
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,500
That's the idea, Rat.
That's the attitude.

249
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,660
- The attitude?
- Yeah.

250
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,300
The attitude dictates
that you don't care whether
she comes, stays, lays or prays.

251
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,340
Whatever happens,
your toes are still tappin'.

252
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,040
Now, when you got that...
then you have the attitude.

253
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,210
- Good night, Stacy.
- Good night, Mom.

254
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:45,050


255
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:01,380
<i> Just look at that girl with the lights
coming up in her eyes</i>

256
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,410
<i> She's got to be somebody's baby</i>

257
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:13,050
<i> She must be somebody's baby</i>

258
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,360
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks. So do you.

259
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,860
Where do you feel like going?

260
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,130
I don't know.

261
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,500
- How 'bout The Point?
- Okay.

262
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:29,060
All right!
The Point it is.

263
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,200
<i> She's got to be somebody's baby</i>

264
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,400
<i> She's so fine</i>

265
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,040
<i> She's probably somebody's only light</i>

266
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,640
<i> Gonna shine tonight</i>

267
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,560
<i> Yeah, she's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>

268
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,360
<i> She's gonna be somebody's only light</i>

269
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,830
<i> Gonna shine tonight</i>

270
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,770
<i> Yeah, she's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>

271
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,350
That's a really nice jacket.

272
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,620
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

273
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,420
- It's warm.
- Yeah, it is. It's really warm.

274
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,990
I wonder how long it will last.

275
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,970
So...

276
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,780
am I gonna get to first base?

277
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,790
- Are you really 19?
- Yeah, yeah, I am. I'm really 19.

278
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:07,130
<i> She's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>

279
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:13,200
<i> I try to shut my eyes
but I can't get her out of my sight</i>

280
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:20,950
<i> I know I'm gonna know it
but I gotta get over my fright</i>

281
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,910
<i> I'm just gonna walk up to her</i>

282
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,930
<i> I'm gonna talk to her tonight</i>

283
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,370
<i> Gonna shine tonight
Make her mine tonight?

284
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,500
<i> Yeah</i>

285
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:53,110
<i> Gonna shine tonight
Make her mine tonight</i>

286
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,950
So tell me, do you like Ron?

287
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,290
I like Ron, but it hurt so bad.

288
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,020
Don't worry. Keep doing it.
It gets a lot better. I swear.

289
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,620
It better.

290
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,460
<i> Raised on the radio</i>

291
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,490
<i> Just an all-American boy</i>

292
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,600
<i> I got my favorite toy</i>

293
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,370
<i> I was
raised on the radio</i>

294
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,470
<i> Yeah, I was raised on the radio</i>

295
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,910
<i> Remembering when times were bad</i>

296
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,550
<i> Love is all we need
and love was all we had</i>

297
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,280
- Mom says to clean the pool.
- Why can't you do it?

298
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,850
Your friends use the pool.
Your friends messed it up.

299
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,190
- Your friends use the pool too.
- I take out the garbage!

300
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,000
Brad!

301
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,520
- Brad, have Mom and Dad seen these?
- They're not home yet.

302
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,280
- Brad?
- What?

303
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,330
What would you say if
I asked you to put these...

304
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,360
in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel
and get rid of them?

305
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,760
- I'd say, "Who the hell is Ron Johnson?"
- Please.

306
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,990
Thank you very much.

307
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,830
- Lisa's great!
- Yeah.

308
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:28,640
I don't understand why you want
to break up with a girl like that.

309
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,050
Me and Lisa have been going together
for two years. I love her and all.

310
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,210
I mean, she's great in bed.

311
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:40,490
It's just that...
I'm a single, successful guy.

312
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:47,490
And this is my last year in school.
This could be the best year of my life!

313
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,200
I just feel like I need
my freedom now, you know?

314
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,070
Okay, here's your preparation stuff.

315
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,310
You got your sliced tomatoes,
shredded lettuce, secret sauce.

316
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,140
- What's the secret sauce?
- Thousand Island dressing.

317
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,710
What's the secret sauce
at Bronco Burger?

318
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,480
- Ketchup and mayonnaise.
- Gotcha.

319
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,020
Order for you, Bradley.

320
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,490
- Were those flowers really for me?
- Of course!

321
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,790
- How much did they cost?
- Don't worry about it.

322
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,830
Want to go to The Point tonight?

323
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,000
What's there to do at The Point?

324
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,530
What do you mean? We've been
going out together for two years.

325
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,770
I don't want to have to use sex
as a tool, Brad.

326
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,780
Tool? Tool for what?
We've been going together for two years!

327
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,150
- I don't want to talk about it here.
- I wanna talk about it!

328
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,520
- Brad?
- Lisa!

329
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,990
Brad!

330
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,720
You gotta flip 'em, or they'll burn.
Great.

331
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,790
"C."

332
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,060
"D."

333
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,790
"F."

334
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:01,330
"F." "F."

335
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,700
Three weeks we've been talking
about the Platt Amendment.

336
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,070
What are you people, on dope?

337
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,010
A piece of legislation was introduced
into Congress by Senator John Platt.

338
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,350
It was passed in 1906.

339
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,680
This amendment to our Constitution...

340
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,250
has a profound impact
upon all of our...

341
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,820
Where is Jeff Spicoli? I saw him earlier
today near the first floor bathrooms.

342
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,730
Is he still on campus?
Anyone? Yes, Desmond?

343
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,390
I saw him by the food machines.

344
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,100
- How long ago?
- Right before class.

345
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,400
Okay.
Bring him in.

346
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,700
What is this fascination with truancy?

347
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,610
What is it that gets inside your heads?

348
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,520
There are some teachers in this school
who look the other way at truants.

349
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,610
It's a little game
that you both play.

350
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,590
They pretend they don't see you.
You pretend you don't ditch.

351
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,360
Now, who pays the price later?
You!

352
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,660
Wait a minute.
There's no birthday party for me here!

353
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,200
Hola, Mr. Hand.

354
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,740
What's the reason for your truancy?

355
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,040
Just couldn't make it on time.

356
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,740
You mean,
you couldn't or you wouldn't?

357
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,380
It was like a full crowd scene
at the food lines.

358
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,580
Food will be eaten on your time.

359
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,220
Why are you continuously late
for this class, Mr. Spicoli?

360
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:31,750
Why do you shamelessly waste
my time like this?

361
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,600
- I don't know.
- 

362
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,850
I like that.


363
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,620
"I don't know."
That's nice!

364
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,920
"Mr. Hand,
will I pass this class?"

365
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,930
"Gee, Mr. Spicoli,
I don't know!"

366
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,520
That's nice. I really like that.
You know what I'm gonna do?

367
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,560
I'm going to leave your words on this
board for all my classes to enjoy.

368
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,110
Giving you full credit,
of course, Mr. Spicoli!

369
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,970
All right.

370
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,740


371
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,820
<i> Sleigh bells ring
are you listening</i>

372
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,650
- Mommy!
- <i> In the lane</i>

373
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,280
- Oh, no!
- <i> Snow is glistening</i>

374
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,890
<i> A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight</i>

375
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,160
<i> Walking in a winter wonderland</i>

376
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,460
How fucking long
do I have to wait?

377
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,670
Christmas sucks.
I hate it.

378
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,540
You gotta get used to working holidays.
People are always screaming.

379
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,840
I have to quit this job.
I'm gonna get so fat...

380
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:00,820
- no one's gonna want to take me out.
- Ron hasn't called, huh?

381
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,580
- Not since November.
- What does it matter?
He's a stereo salesman.

382
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,420
What'd you wanna do, marry him?
Have kids with him?

383
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,760
Have this guy come home
50 years old and bald?

384
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,390
And have that little Pacific Stereo
sign on? Come on, Stace.

385
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,300
Hey, it's his loss.

386
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,430
Got any Blue Oyster Cult?

387
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,960
No, I don't have any
Blue Oyster Cult.

388
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,700
I ate 34 pairs last time.
Where were you?

389
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,110
I was that close to working
at 7-Eleven, you know.

390
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,580
What?

391
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,350
- All right! Play me?
- Totally.

392
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,720
You got quarters?

393
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,700
When are those Earth, Wind and Fire
tickets comin' in?

394
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,860
Earth, Wind and Fire?
Geez, I haven't heard anything.

395
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,930
The minute I do,
I'll let you know.

396
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,530
I'm plannin' on taking
my little brother over here.

397
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:59,270
Is that your little brother?
He's a good-lookin' kid.

398
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,310
Great.
Charles Jefferson...

399
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,750
for Earth, Wind and Fire
and little brother.

400
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,910
I'll let you know when
they come around, okay?

401
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,150


402
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,250
Wow! Does he really live here?
I thought he just flew in for games.

403
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,060
Shit! He knows where to come
when he wants some tickets.

404
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,570
Go on. Get outta here.
You're messing up my business.

405
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,500
Come on, Rat.
Let's go get you a woman.

406
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,500
Wow.

407
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,700
You ready for
your moment of truth?

408
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,540
Damone, I noticed I was starting
to get a pimple this morning...

409
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,940
Rat, the shyness routine
is really starting to aggravate me.

410
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:41,140
I mean, who is she, anyway?
She's a waitress in a pizza parlor.

411
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,590
Look at her. Look at you.
A member of the Honor Roll.

412
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,820
Assistant to the assistant manager
of the movie theater.

413
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:53,960
Rat, if this girl
can't smell your qualifications,
then who needs her, right?

414
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,190
- Right.
- All right. How do you feel?

415
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,230
- I feel good.
- Do ya? All right.

416
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,290
Now stop fucking around
and go get her.

417
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,860
Hey, Rat, you gotta ace that jacket.

418
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,380
- Yeah?
- Yeah. All right, that's cool.

419
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,850
You look good. All right?
Go get her.

420
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,680
$1.10, and you get five cents back.

421
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,690
Thanks.

422
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,720
- Hi! Don't I know you
from biology class?
- Yeah!

423
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,600
- What can I do for you?
- I had a couple of questions.
I was curious.

424
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,530
What do you do with the
jackets people leave here?

425
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,800
- We keep 'em.
- You keep 'em?

426
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,370
In case they come back.
You can look through it if you want.

427
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,740
No, that's cool. It would take
too long to look through all that.

428
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,040
I'll pick up a new one.

429
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,840
What was your other question?

430
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,620
Oh, my other question is...

431
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,990
can I have your phone number
so I can ask you out sometime?

432
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:02,460
- Do you have a pen?
This one's out of ink.
- Yeah.

433
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,270
Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy.
My name is Mark Ratner.

434
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,620
I've gotta go.

435
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,000
Lisa, I have something to tell you.

436
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,530
Look, I'm a senior now.

437
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,880
I'm a single, successful guy.

438
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,680
And I've got to be fair to myself.

439
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,450
Lisa... I think I need my freedom.

440
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,020
Oh, don't do that.

441
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,260
- Please, please don't do that.
- Brad!

442
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,390
- Can you cover me on register two?
- Okay.

443
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,100
- May I help you?
- Ah, yes.

444
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,510
This is not the best breakfast
I ever ate and...

445
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,600
- I'd like my money back.
- Okay. I believe
you have to fill out a form.

446
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,840
No. I'd like my money back now.

447
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,350
I'm sorry. It doesn't work that way.
I have to fill out a form.

448
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,850
Well, you ate most of it
already so...

449
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,980
See that sign?
It says "100% guaranteed."

450
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,790
You know what the meaning
of guarantee is?
Did they teach you that here?

451
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,520
Sir, if you'd just wait a minute.

452
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,530
Look. Just put your little hand
in the cash register...

453
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,630
and give me my $2.75 back,
please, Brad.

454
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,200
Sir, if you'd just give me a minute.
I'll find the forms.
I'll take care of everything.

455
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,250
I don't have a minute.
You've made me late enough.

456
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,110
I am so tired of dealing
with incompetence.

457
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,210
It says 100% guaranteed,
you moron!

458
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,620
Mister, if you don't shut up,
I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.

459
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,130
Ah, is there a problem here?
Can I help you, sir?

460
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:14,220
You bet you have a problem.
Your employee used profanity
and threatened me with violence.

461
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,030
I'm surprised. I eat here all the time
and usually have good service.

462
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:22,090
All I wanted was my money back on this
breakfast. It was a little under-cooked.

463
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,010
And he threatens me with violence.
I'm gonna call your super...

464
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,310
I can take care of it.

465
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:34,010
Mr. Hamilton, did you threaten this
customer or use profanity in any way?

466
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,220
Uh... he insulted me first.
He called me a moron, Dennis.

467
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:42,880
Answer me! Did you threaten
this customer or use profanity?

468
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,590
- Yes.
- You're fired.

469
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,430
I'm very sorry, sir.
I'll refund your money right now.

470
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,430
I hope you won't hold this against us.

471
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,200
You know how these young kids are
these days.

472
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,710
 Here we are.
Perhaps another breakfast?

473
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,900
I hope you had
a hell of a piss, Arnold!

474
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,920
 The world's finest
surfers showed up today to do battle...

475
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:14,550
with what's turned out to be the biggest
waves to hit this coast since 1946.

476
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,060
Hello. I'm Stu Nahan,
and I'd like you to meet this young man.

477
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:21,120
His name, Jeff Spicoli.
Jeff, congratulations.

478
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,720
Things looked rough out there today.

479
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,330
I'll tell you, Stu,
I did battle with some humongous waves.

480
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,340
Just like I told the guy on ABC,
"Danger is my business."

481
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:37,370
A lot of people
expected Mark "Cutback" Davis,
or Bob "Jungle Vet" Gerard...

482
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,970
- would take the honors this year.
- Those guys are fags!

483
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:44,820
Let me ask you. When you get out there,
do you ever fear for your life?

484
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:49,480
Stu, surfing's not a sport.
It's a way of life. It's no hobby.

485
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:54,290
It's a way of looking at that wave
and saying, "Hey, bud, let's party!"

486
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,630
Where'd you get this jacket?

487
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,600
From the network. Let me ask you,
what's next for Jeff Spicoli?

488
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,660
Headed over to the Australian
and then the Hawaiian Internationals.

489
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,040
Then me and Mick are gonna wing on over
to London and jam with the Stones.

490
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,450
You guys are invited too.

491
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,750
Jeff! Jeff!

492
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,020
Jeff, Dad says you have to get up.

493
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,920
- Leave me alone.
- Dad says you're gonna be late again,
you butthole!

494
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,660
- Leave me alone!
- Dad says you're gonna be late again,
you booger!

495
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:30,500
Dad, Jeff threw his snorkel at me!

496
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,130
We just want to say that
we're not Spirit Bunnies anymore.

497
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:40,140
We always hated that name.
It bugged the heck out of Dina and me.

498
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,770
- It's just such a put-down!
- Really!

499
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:47,040
We know you've got a lot of spirit,
everybody, right?

500
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,450
And we're gonna destroy Lincoln
next week! All right!

501
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:57,560
You know, it takes a lot
of courage to get up here...

502
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,290
and do something that
you know people will make fun of.

503
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,560
- Yeah.
- Man...

504
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,330
I'm never gonna talk
to those guys again.

505
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,360
I'm the one who got Arnold and Dave
their jobs there in the first place.

506
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,340
If you'd apologize to Dennis,
I'm sure he'd take you back.

507
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,810
Fuck Dennis Taylor!
I'm not gonna apologize to that wimp.

508
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,580
I'm just glad
we're still together...

509
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:27,060
because a lot's happened,
and I really need you this year.

510
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,490
Look, Brad, I've been trying
to think of a way to tell you this.

511
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,200
We're almost out of school.
It's our last year.

512
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,830
And I think we owe it
to ourselves to be free,

513
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:45,740
to go out with other people.

514
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,580
I still want to be friends.

515
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,670
What do I say to her
once we get in the car?

516
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,050
No problem, Rat. What you need
is my special five-point plan.

517
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,280
Come on, Damone, I need real help.

518
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,350
What'd you mean?
Men have died...

519
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,660
trying to obtain this
valuable information.

520
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,660
- But I'll give it to you for free.
- What's your five-point plan?

521
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,130
All right.
Now, pay attention.

522
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:20,070
First of all, you never let on
how much you like a girl.

523
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,240
Oh, Debbie... hi.

524
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,610
Two.
You always call the shots.

525
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,380
Kiss me, you won't regret it.

526
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:35,890
Three. Act like wherever you are,
that's the place to be.

527
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,120
Isn't this great?

528
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,720
Four.

529
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,000
When ordering food, find out what she
wants, then order for the both of you.

530
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,970
It's a classy move.

531
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,270
The lady will have
the linguine in a white clam sauce,

532
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,740
and a coke with no ice.

533
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,540
And five.

534
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,170
Now, this is most important, Rat.

535
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,340
When it comes down to makin' out,

536
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,410
whenever possible,

537
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,210
put on side one
of Led Zeppelin IV.

538
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,590


539
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,900
- This is a nice car.
- Yeah. It's my sister's.

540
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,100
Yeah?

541
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,470
Do you have Mrs. George
for English?

542
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:30,040
- Yeah. She's pretty good.
- Yeah, she is pretty good.

543
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,020
- Have you decided?
- Um, yeah.

544
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,790
I'll have the knockwurst.

545
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,120
Excellent.

546
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,060
You work at Cinema Four, right?

547
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,970
That must be great.
You get to see all those free movies.

548
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,230
You get free popcorn.

549
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,670
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

550
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,180
Would you mind if I excuse
myself for a moment?

551
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,410
Oh, no, go ahead.

552
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,010
Are you ready to order here?

553
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,050
She will have the knockwurst.

554
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,090
And you?

555
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,020
- I'll have the same.
- Anything to drink?

556
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,530
- Coke.
- Two Cokes.

557
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,660
Okay.
Thank you.

558
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,160
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

559
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,470


560
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,530
- Hello?
- Mike, it's Mark.

561
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:38,780
- What happened to your date?
- It's happening right now.
Everything's fine except...

562
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,880
I left my wallet at home.

563
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,940
Why don't you go home and get it?

564
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,150
No, I can't! I'm here.
The food's coming and everything.

565
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,820
Look, would you do me a favor?

566
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,630
Just borrow your mom's car, drive to my
house, get my wallet and bring it here.

567
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,790
Hello? Mike?

568
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:01,630
Mike?

569
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,540
Geez, I'm really kinda busy, Rat.

570
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,540
Just do me this one favor.

571
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,270
I swear I won't ask you for anything
again in this lifetime or any other.

572
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,480
- But just please do this for me.
- You owe me for this one.

573
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,540
Okay, thanks.
Thanks a lot. Thanks.

574
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,950
-  Beaver, are you all right?
- What happened?

575
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,790
Are you sure there's nothing else
I can bring you?

576
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,800
Do you want another Coke?

577
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,960
Um... okay.

578
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,510
Two more Cokes.

579
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,570
Two more Cokes.

580
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,040
- Hey, Mark, is that you?
- Yeah, hi.

581
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,640
- You come here?
- Yeah. I come for the strudel.
It's great.

582
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,780
Hey, listen, I found your wallet
the other day. You want it back?

583
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,580
Oh, wow! Yeah.
I was looking for this.

584
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,680
Oh, Mike,
you don't know Stacy Hamilton.

585
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,200
- Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
- Hi.

586
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,130
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

587
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,030
See you later.

588
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,270
Right. Gotta be goin'.
See you later.

589
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,800
You wanna go?

590
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,350
Um... yeah.

591
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:33,060
- I had a really nice time tonight.
- Me too.

592
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,100
I'm real sorry someone broke in
and stole your tape deck.

593
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,660
I never thought it would've happened
at such a fancy place.

594
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,830
I know.
You want to come in for a sec?

595
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,030
- Okay, sure.
- Good.

596
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,980
- Where's your brother?
- He's out tonight with some friends.

597
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,050
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, that's... that's okay.

598
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:04,580
Oh. Well,
would you mind if I change?

599
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,650
No.

600
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,030
Okay. Could you get this for me?
It always sticks.

601
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,240
Thanks.

602
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,910
Where are your parents?

603
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,250
My parents are out of town
for the weekend.

604
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,410
Brad and I are watching the house.

605
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,380
- This is a really nice picture of you.
- Thanks.

606
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,720
You can come in my room
if you want.

607
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,030
So, what do you want to do?

608
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,480
I don't know.

609
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:59,110
Um, you want to look
at a photo album?

610
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,450
I keep a lot of pictures
from when I grew up and stuff.

611
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,710
- It's kinda stupid, huh?
- Sure! Yeah.

612
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,150
Yeah? Great.

613
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,220
Photographs.

614
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,490
This is the one that Brad took.

615
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,660
It's like double-image type thing,
you know. It's like a mirror.

616
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,300
This is me being stupid.

617
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:26,270
And this is my dog Gypsy,
and my cat Tullio.

618
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,940
- They're dead now.
- Remember him? Mr. Degan?

619
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,110
You had Degan?

620
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,450
- He always wore the same suit!
- The same suit!

621
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,980
- He must've had 500 of those suits.
- He was terrible!

622
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,780
No, I think it was one.

623
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:46,190
<i> So you go out there
and you get one too</i>

624
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,260
<i> Love rules</i>

625
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,960
<i> Ohh, love rules</i>

626
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:58,810
<i> Love rules</i>

627
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,710
<i> Yeah, love rules</i>

628
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,520
- You know, I just thought of something.
- What?

629
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:13,750
My sister is crazy
when it comes to her car.

630
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,690
- It's gotta be back by 11:00.
- Want to call her?

631
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,750
No. Look, l... She gets crazy.

632
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,990
Her car is her baby.

633
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,330
- I better be going.
- Really?

634
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,000
I'll call you.
Well, I'll see you in class. Okay?

635
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,040
Bye.

636
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:33,670
<i>Love rules</i>

637
00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:00,270
- Mark Ratner doesn't like me.
- Mark Ratner doesn't like you?
You're crazy!

638
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,330
No, he shows absolutely
no interest in me.

639
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:07,640
Mark Ratner is definitely somebody
you'd have to make the first move with.

640
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,700
Linda, I did. I made the first move,
I made the second move.

641
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,340
I made a complete jerk out of myself,
is what I did.

642
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,540
What do you care about
Mark Ratner for?

643
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,380
He's a 16-year-old usher
in the movie theater.

644
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,620
You have dated older guys. You work
at the best food stand in the mall.

645
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:28,220
And you are a close
personal friend of mine.

646
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,960
Yeah. But I was really
beginning to like him.

647
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,770
Yeah? If that's true,
you better find somebody else fast.

648
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,750
- Seen the new Playboy?
- Good?

649
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,260
- Bo Derek's tits!
- All right!

650
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,310
I like sex.

651
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,560


652
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,160
People on ludes
should not drive.

653
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:10,160


654
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,900
Hey, this is my brother's car!

655
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,340
- You said he was outta town.
- And he is.

656
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:17,780
All right.
Then don't hassle it.

657
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,360
Are you crazy, Spicoli?
That light was red!

658
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:41,060
- It was yellow a minute ago.
- You're gonna scratch my brother's car.

659
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,830
No, I'm not.


660
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:47,740
Look, I'm driving.
You navigate.

661
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,180
Where is this party?

662
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,810
Make a right, right here.
Here! Here! Here!

663
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,340
My brother's gonna kill us!
He's gonna kill us!

664
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,340
He's gonna kill you. He's gonna kill me.
He's gonna kill us!

665
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,000
Hey, man, just be glad
I had fast reflexes.

666
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,710
- My brother's gonna shit!
- Make up your mind, dude.

667
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,810
Is he gonna shit,
or is he gonna kill us?

668
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,580
First he's gonna shit,
then he's gonna kill us.

669
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:36,490
Relax, all right?
My old man is a television repairman.

670
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,500
He's got this ultimate set of tools.
I can fix it!

671
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,260
You can't fix this car, Spicoli!

672
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:50,840
- I can fix it.
- Ha.

673
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,380
Hey!

674
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,490
- I'm giving you $50...
- No, no, no!

675
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,530
That means if you win
I give you $25.

676
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,300
If I win, you give me $5.

677
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:22,860
- You can't lose.
- All right.

678
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,910
I'll put you down for $5.

679
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:28,170
Now, don't forget about
the 14-point spread.

680
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,410
Fourteen-point sp...

681
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,120
 I don't believe those guys
at Lincoln did this to Jefferson's car!

682
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,450
They totalled it.
I can't believe it.

683
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,280
Jefferson's gonna really make
Lincoln pay for this.

684
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,150
That guy's gonna totally
destroy them.

685
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,260
Annihilate.
You know what I mean?

686
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,770
Shit, he is pissed off.

687
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:20,120
<i> They may well mean
what they say about you</i>

688
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,460
<i> You might wander back
to future friends</i>

689
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,090


690
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,430


691
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:35,710
<i> Come too close
and take you by the hand</i>

692
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:40,380
<i> 'Cause now you see there's more
to life then what we lovers do</i>

693
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,180
- Oh, shit!
- Hut. Hut.

694
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,460


695
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:54,960
 Brought down again
by 33, Charles Jefferson.

696
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:59,370
Hit by Jefferson.
Crushed by Jefferson.

697
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,200
Man! Jefferson. Jefferson.
Jefferson. Jefferson.

698
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,070
Jefferson.

699
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,740
Stretcher!

700
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:11,840


701
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:15,380
Again by Jefferson.

702
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:26,920
Five, four, three, two, one!

703
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,190


704
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,130
- There's nothing to eat here.
- What do you mean?

705
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,730
- Take a look. There's nothing I can eat.
- Get a trout dog.

706
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:39,470
Forget it. Do you have any fish here
that isn't breaded?

707
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,600
- It's all prepared the same way.
- Get a whaler.

708
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,670
Or a clamwich.

709
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:47,180
Ever hear the word blemish?
Want me to eat something fried?

710
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,010
- Let's get outta here.
- Let's go.

711
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,290
Thank you.
Come again, and have a nice day.

712
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:01,520
I sent a letter to Doug today.
Can't wait 'til he gets out here.

713
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,090
- What's Doug doing in Chicago?
- He works for the airline.
You'll meet him.

714
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:08,530
Oh, Linda, you have to do this.

715
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,370
- What?
- "Rate Your Mate."

716
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,410
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

717
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,410
- Let me test Doug.
- Okay.

718
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,570
"Most satisfactory
lovemaking occurs:

719
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,670
"A, when your mate climaxes first.

720
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,210
B, you climax first.
C, you and your mate climax together?"

721
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,050
Climax together.

722
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,060
This is gonna be great, Rat.

723
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,590
It's like the highlight of their day.

724
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,180
Maybe we oughta call first. I don't know
about dropping in like this.

725
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,860
Are you kiddin'?
We're gonna surprise 'em.

726
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:38,130
Just fix your collar, all right?

727
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,730
Relax. Just be cool.
Attitude, remember?

728
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,860
- Where'd you get that, the hamper?
- Hey, this is clean.

729
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,670
It's like riding a bike.
You fall off, you get right back on.

730
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,140
You mess up a date, do it again!

731
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,610
- Do you always climax with Doug?
- Yes.

732
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:59,850
I think so.
He's no high school boy.

733
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,450
Hey!

734
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,520
Come over to help you
with your math homework.

735
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:08,090
Figured you could use it
on such a hot day.

736
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,690
Don't worry.
They're gonna let us in.

737
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:13,700
Okay.

738
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,170
- Promise you're going to leave
as soon as my mother gets home.
- Okay.

739
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:28,620
- Linda, this is Mike and Mark.
- How you doin'?

740
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,380
The water looks great.
Check it out.

741
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,250
Looks fine.
Wai...

742
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:41,460
Very funny!
Very funny!

743
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:53,300
-  Lin, come in!
-  I'll teach you to dive.

744
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,970
I used to be a champion, you know.

745
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:58,840


746
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,550


747
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,910
Does Mom know you have company?

748
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:11,190
It's just Mark and Mike from school.

749
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,750
- Hi.
-  How ya doin'?

750
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,760
- Hi, Linda.
- Hi, Brad.

751
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:18,160
Ow!

752
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:23,500
Uh, could you keep it down?
I have work to do inside.

753
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,200
Okay.

754
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,270
Who's his tailor?

755
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:30,780
God, he hardly even talks anymore.

756
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:34,110
Yeah, I know.
He hates wearing a uniform.

757
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,740
 Rat, show them
how you can stand up underwater.

758
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,150
? Da-um-da-um-da-um?

759
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,050
What are you doing?

760
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,820
- Watch out, Rat!
- Leave me alone!

761
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:49,160
 All right, Damone,
you're gonna get it.

762
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:07,070
Hi, Brad.

763
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:10,080
You know how cute
I always thought you were.

764
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:51,420
Stacy, do you have Q-tips?
I've got water in my ears.

765
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:53,930
I don't know.
Check in the house.

766
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,630
Wait. Just a minute.

767
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:09,210
Doesn't anybody
fucking knock anymore?

768
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:12,380


769
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:23,550


770
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:27,760
In 1898, Spain owned Cuba outright.

771
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,760
Think about it.

772
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:34,500
Cuba owned by a disorganized
parliament 4,000 miles away.

773
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:37,730
Cubans were in a constant...

774
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:44,270
Cubans were in
a constant state of revolt.

775
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:46,310
In 1904...

776
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:50,510
the United States decided
to throw weight around...

777
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,990
- Who is it?
- Mr. Pizza Guy.

778
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,080
- Again?
- Mr. Pizza Guy, sir.

779
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,860


780
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:07,630
- Who ordered
the double cheese and sausage?
- Right here, dude.

781
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,340
For you, dude.

782
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:30,060
Am I hallucinating? What in the hell
do you think you're doing?

783
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,060
Learning about Cuba,
and having some food.

784
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,690
Mr. Spicoli,
you're on dangerous ground.

785
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,700
You're causing a major disturbance
on my time.

786
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:41,700
I've been thinking about this,
Mr. Hand.

787
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:46,070
If I'm here and you're here,
doesn't that make it "our" time?

788
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:50,010
There's nothing wrong
with a feast on "our" time.

789
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,520
You're absolutely right.
It is our time.

790
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,750
Yours, mine and everyone else's
in this room.

791
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:03,420
But it is my class.
Hamilton, Brandt, Cornfeld, up front!

792
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:06,520
Mr. Spicoli has been kind enough
to bring us a snack.

793
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,660
Be my guest.
Help yourselves.

794
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,600
Get a good one.

795
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:21,800
- Mike? Mike? Hi.
- Hi.

796
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,810
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

797
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,340
I hate walking. I have to walk
every day. It's such a drag.

798
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,440
Why don't you get a ride
with somebody?

799
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,610
Sometimes I ride with my brother,
but he works mornings.

800
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:37,390
- Then he drives himself to school.
- What a guy!

801
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:41,730
Listen, Mark Ratner
really likes you.

802
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:46,330
- Do you like him?
- Mark is really nice.

803
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,630
But I think I like you.

804
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:02,820
Well, uh... this is me.

805
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:06,750
- Do you have any iced tea?
- Yeah, sure.

806
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,790
Come on in.

807
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:14,960
The annuals are coming out
pretty soon.

808
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:18,730
- You gonna get one?
- I don't know.

809
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:23,070
Oh, come on. Aren't you curious
to see how your picture turned out?

810
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,770
- I know what I look like.
- I know.

811
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,240
But it's nice to have pictures
of your friends and stuff.

812
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:32,180
I don't know. Maybe.
It's no big deal.

813
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:35,310
I probably will.

814
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,320
Must be nice having a pool.

815
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:40,150
- You want to go swimming?
- Yeah, sure.

816
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,590
- I'm going to go change, okay?
- Yeah.

817
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,750
Okay, great.

818
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,930
This is great iced tea.

819
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,370
- Come on.
- Huh?

820
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,710
Brad keeps his stuff
in the change room.

821
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,820
- This is nice.
- Yeah?

822
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:22,890
- Yeah.
- These'll fit you.

823
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,740
- You're really a good kisser.
- Yeah?

824
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:40,840
So are you.

825
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:50,750
You want to take off
your clothes, Mike?

826
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:53,560
You first.

827
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:57,330
Both of us at the same time.

828
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,330
Okay.

829
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:06,000
<i> She's gonna be
somebody's only light</i>

830
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:09,040
<i> Gonna shine tonight</i>

831
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:16,240
<i> Yeah, she's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>

832
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:22,260
<i> I try to shut my eyes
but I can't get her out of my sight</i>

833
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:30,120
<i> I know I'm gonna know it
but I gotta get over my fright</i>

834
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:35,470
- Wait.
- <i> I'm just gonna walk up to her</i>

835
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,270
- <i> I'm gonna talk to her tonight</i>
- M-Mike! Mike!

836
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:42,940


837
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:45,070
Are you okay?

838
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,210
Ahh.

839
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,580
I think I came.
Didn't you feel it?

840
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:53,140
Yeah. I guess I did.

841
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:59,290
I gotta go, Stacy.

842
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,920
I've really gotta go.

843
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,980
- See ya.
- Bye.

844
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:23,410
Linda, how long does Doug take?

845
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:26,390
- Doug takes forever.
- Come on.

846
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:30,150
He takes, uh... 20 to 30 minutes.

847
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:33,560
I thought you said
he took 30 to 40 minutes.

848
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:37,260
That's right. I'm sorry.
I meant 30 to 40 minutes.

849
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:39,360
How long did Damone take?

850
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:44,870
Damone took, uh...
15 to 20 minutes.

851
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:48,710
That's not bad for a high school boy.

852
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:54,310
<i> Raised on the radio</i>

853
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,940
<i> Yeah, I was raised on the radio</i>

854
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:00,320
<i> Just like an all-American boy</i>

855
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:03,120
- Mike! Hi!
- Hi.

856
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:06,390
- God, I haven't seen you for a while.
- Yeah.

857
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:09,950
- In a hurry. Got stuff I gotta do.
- I'm in a hurry too.

858
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:13,090
- I just thought I'd say hi to you.
- Hi.

859
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,210
Hamilton, I'll take over
the fryer for a while.

860
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:22,570
Those boys at I.B.M. Ordered a stack
of those Catch-of-the-Day boxes.

861
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:27,050
- I told them you would personally
deliver them within the hour.
- Aye, aye, sir.

862
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,420
Hamilton, come over here.

863
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,090
- What are you doing?
- I'm changing.

864
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:46,130
You took off your Captain Hook uniform.

865
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,100
I thought I'd put street clothes on
for the drive to I.B.M.

866
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,110
The uniform's uncomfortable.

867
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:56,610
You're going there as a representative
of Captain Hook Fish and Chips.

868
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,980
Part of our image, part of our appeal
is that uniform. You know that.

869
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:02,450
You want me to put
the stuff back on?

870
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,110
Yes, I do. Show a little pride.

871
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:07,820
Aye, aye, sir.

872
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:18,220
<i> Talk on the phone
Call up the coast</i>

873
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:22,330
<i> Call it collect
Dial direct</i>

874
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,400
<i> Reverse the charges
If they accept, they're home</i>

875
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:34,410
<i> Or you can go overseas
Speak Japanese</i>

876
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,610
<i> Buy a new Sony
They make great TVs</i>

877
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:43,120
<i> Do the Watusi
Watch I Love Lucy too</i>

878
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,880
<i> But don't let nobody</i>

879
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:09,080
<i> Tell ya that
there's nothin' to do</i>

880
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:12,990
<i> Well, well, well, well
Don't let nobody</i>

881
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:16,790
<i> Tell ya that
there's nothin' to do</i>

882
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:23,520
Dina, can you honestly tell me
that you forgot?

883
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,630
Forgot the magnetism of Robin Zander
or the charisma of Rick Nielsen?

884
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,690
- That's kid stuff.
- Kid stuff?

885
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:35,270
How 'bout the tunes?
<i> I want you to want me</i>

886
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,470
<i> The dream police
Da-na-na-na-na-na</i>

887
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,520
<i> Your mama's all right
Your daddy's all right</i>

888
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:45,880
- <i> They just seem a little bit weird</i>
- Mike? Mike?

889
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,890
Can I talk to you for a sec?

890
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,830
Stacy, I'm doing business.
Call me tonight, all right?

891
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:57,800
No. I've gotta talk to you now.
Okay?

892
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:02,260
Don't go away.

893
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,310
Look at 'em.

894
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:09,840
I hope this is important
because I could be blowin' a big deal.

895
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:11,940
Mike, I just...

896
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:15,450
I just want you to know
that I'm pregnant.

897
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,350
How do you know it's mine?
We only did it once.

898
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:24,390
I haven't been with anybody else.
I know it's yours.

899
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,720
Jesus!
It was your idea.

900
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,560
You wanted to do it.
You wanted it more than I did.

901
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,930
No.
Take that back.

902
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:38,200
All right.
I take it back.

903
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:41,610
Look, we gotta do somethin' about it.

904
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,770
I mean, uh,
we gotta get an abortion.

905
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:48,610
My brother Art got his girlfriend
one once. It's simple.

906
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:53,710
- It's no big deal.
- Yeah. I got that planned.

907
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:57,720
It's going to cost $150
at the Free Clinic.

908
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:01,490
Doesn't sound free to me.

909
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,230
I suppose you want me
to pay for it.

910
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,290
Half, okay?
And a ride to the clinic.

911
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:09,840
Seventy-five dollars and a ride.

912
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,900
Okay.

913
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,240
Okay. Thanks.

914
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,320
Thank you.

915
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,350
God.

916
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:28,990
Rick, I need that $50 you owe me.

917
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:33,590
- Don't have it.
- I know times are tight,
but I really need it.

918
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:37,830
- Don't have it now.
- When you needed the tickets,
I got 'em for you.

919
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,270
So close to stage
you probably scared the band.

920
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:42,770
I'm not the Bank of America.

921
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,900
I know you're not the Bank of America,
but I need my $50.

922
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:49,740
- How about Thursday?
- Thursday's too late.
I need it tonight.

923
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:52,370
Can't give you what I don't have.

924
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:57,150
Just forget about it.
I'll get it from you Thursday, okay?

925
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,620
All right.
See ya.

926
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,350


927
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,230
<i> Flowers</i>

928
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:11,660
<i> And the vine</i>

929
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,170
<i> Take me</i>

930
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,930
<i> Sleeping angel</i>

931
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:23,140
<i> Catch me when you can</i>

932
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:27,310
<i> Feel love better</i>

933
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:31,410
<i> Heavy steps for a woman</i>

934
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:33,980
<i> And a man</i>

935
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,920
Is Mike there?
This is Stacy.

936
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:38,020
Hold on, please.

937
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:42,430
Stacy, he says he's helping
his father in the garage.

938
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,930
He'll call you later.

939
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:49,060
Brad!

940
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,500
Wait a second.

941
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,370
- Yeah, this is it.
We're just going bowling.
- Okay.

942
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,380
- Thanks a lot.
- See you later.

943
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:01,380
Okay.

944
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:19,200
- How we doing in here?
Debbie, you ready to leave?
- Yes. Thank you.

945
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,260
Stacy, I can't let you go
unless you have a ride home.

946
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:28,780
- Oh. I told my boyfriend
to meet me downstairs.
- Okay.

947
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,830
Thanks.

948
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:41,850
Brad.

949
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:47,960
Since when do you
go bowling anyway?

950
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:51,260
Okay, Brad.
Please don't tell Mom and Dad.

951
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:54,600
Come on!
Who did it?

952
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,980
You're not gonna tell me, are you?

953
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:08,950
Okay.
It'll just be your secret.

954
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,950
Okay.

955
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:14,350
- You all right?
- Yeah.

956
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,480
Come on.

957
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,850
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

958
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,430
I told you to tell Mike to pay for it.
Why didn't you tell him?

959
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,870
Linda, he didn't show up.

960
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,670
That little prick!

961
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:35,710
I called his house.

962
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:40,270
His mother told me he was
in the garage helping his father.

963
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:43,280
Mike Damone's
a no-brain little prick, Stacy.

964
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:45,320
I'm not gonna let him
get away with this.

965
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:50,650
Linda, please don't do anything.
I don't even like the guy.

966
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:55,030
Stacy, he's not a guy.
He's a little prick!

967
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,640
<i> I can't explain the way I feel</i>

968
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:12,000
<i> Each time I get behind the wheel</i>

969
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:18,410
<i> A rush of blood
comes after power surges</i>

970
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:24,120
<i> And my right foot urges
the car to push</i>

971
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:27,250
Hi, Mikey!


972
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:41,740
Hi, Damone.

973
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:56,120
Damone, what went on
between you and Stacy?

974
01:08:56,190 --> 01:09:00,290
Let me tell you something.
Sometimes girls go haywire.

975
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:04,660
It happened a month ago.
I've been trying to think
of a way to tell you ever since.

976
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:08,600
We were out... messin' around,
and something happened.

977
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:11,470
It's over.
It's no big deal.

978
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,470
I never even called her again.

979
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:19,980
If you ask me,
she's a very aggressive girl.

980
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:22,880
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't understand.

981
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:27,320
- She never really was your girlfriend.
- Fuck you, Damone.

982
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:31,920
There are a lot of girls out there,
and you have to mess around with Stacy?

983
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:34,520
What do you gotta prove, anyway?

984
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,360
I'm sorry.

985
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:40,060
I always stick up for you.

986
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:44,370
Whenever people say, "That Damone, he's
a loudmouth," and they say that a lot,

987
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:47,200
I always say,
"Hey, you just don't know Damone."

988
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:51,140
When they call you an idiot,
I say, "Damone's not an idiot.
You just don't know him."

989
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:55,980
Well, you know something, man?
Maybe they do know you pretty good.

990
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:58,180
Maybe I'm just finding out now.

991
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:00,190
Get lost.

992
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:05,390
You want to do something about it, Rat?

993
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,290
You want to do something about it?
Come on.

994
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,560
- Come on, you wuss!
- Okay. Let's go, man.

995
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:13,290
- I'll break your fuckin' head off.
- Do something, man.

996
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:16,930
- A big talker, man!
- Knock this crap off!

997
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:19,340
Take it somewhere else.

998
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:22,070
Not in my gym, buddy.

999
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:29,970
Shit.

1000
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:37,860
Woke up in a great mood.
I don't know what the hell happened.

1001
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,650
Come on. Hurry up.
Hurry up.

1002
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:47,900
Today we're going to explore
how this hospital preserves human life.

1003
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:52,300
We'll be visiting every floor
where these fine doctors and nurses...

1004
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:56,070
take care of us in life...
and in death.

1005
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:59,110


1006
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:07,310
Over 30 children
are delivered here each day.

1007
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:09,750
Dr. Kramer to the nurses' station.

1008
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:12,550
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Hi.

1009
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:14,560
Class, this is Dr. Miller.

1010
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:17,690
He'll be joining us
for the last part of our tour today.

1011
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:20,530
If you guys will follow me, please.

1012
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:25,470
I'd like to ask you one last time.

1013
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:29,270
Conduct yourselves
with the utmost maturity.

1014
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:36,970
- You in my class?
- I am today.

1015
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:47,820
-  Yes, Greg?
- Who are these guys?

1016
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,330
Most of them are derelicts.

1017
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,420
They sold their bodies
to medicine for money.

1018
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,940
- About $30, I think?
- Twenty-five.

1019
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,270
Righteous bucks!

1020
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,670
This gentleman here is named Arthur.

1021
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:05,040
Arthur was good enough
to die last week of heart failure.

1022
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:09,070
We are fortunate today
to view his body...

1023
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:11,640
in its pristine state.

1024
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:18,160
Here an incision has been made.

1025
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:20,290
The ribs have been sawed off,

1026
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:25,230
allowing us to remove
the breastplate...

1027
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,830
and really observe the human organs
as they exist in their natural state.

1028
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,030
Here we have the human lungs.

1029
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,870
And here is the human heart
which, you can see,

1030
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:40,240
is actually located
in the center of your chest.

1031
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:42,780
Ohh! Gnarly!

1032
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,990


1033
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,990
Are you okay?

1034
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:57,460
Yeah.
I'm fine.

1035
01:12:57,530 --> 01:13:01,230
- I just made a jerk out of myself.
- No, you didn't.

1036
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,430
Can't go back in there.

1037
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:07,940
Sure. We'll wait until they come out,
and then we'll blend in.

1038
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:11,070
Here they come.

1039
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:13,170
You're so nice.

1040
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:19,080


1041
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,730
<i> I don't know, I don't know
which way I should go</i>

1042
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:45,750
<i> I don't know</i>

1043
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:49,410
<i> I don't know</i>

1044
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:57,620
<i> I don't know, I don't know
if I'm high or I'm low</i>

1045
01:13:57,690 --> 01:13:59,680
<i> I don't know</i>

1046
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:04,560
<i> I don't know, I don't know
if I'm high or I'm low</i>

1047
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:06,120
<i> I don't know</i>

1048
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,070
<i> I don't know</i>

1049
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:30,680
<i> I don't know</i>

1050
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:40,160
You should be comin' on pretty soon,
dude. How much did you smoke?

1051
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:43,860
This'll be
a little demonstration of that.

1052
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:45,870
Listen up.

1053
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,340
- What was that?
- That was my skull.

1054
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:52,810
- 
- I'm so wasted!

1055
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:55,510
Oh, man!

1056
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:58,780
What is this stuff?

1057
01:14:58,850 --> 01:15:01,120
Doesn't that stuff
cause brain damage?

1058
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:05,220
- Only if you take it
every day for a month.
- Bitchin'! 

1059
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:09,460
- Dude, I'll pick you up in
the van and go to the dance.
- Later.

1060
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:12,290
Jeff, you have company.

1061
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:16,300
Get out of here, Curtis.
I don't hear you unless you knock.

1062
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:24,130
That's better. Entre.

1063
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:28,070
Mr. Hand!

1064
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:31,880
Well, were you going somewhere
tonight, Jeff?

1065
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:33,980
Yeah.
The graduation dance.

1066
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,250
It's the last school fiesta
of the year.

1067
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,160
Hmm. I'm afraid we've got
some business to discuss here.

1068
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:42,320
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?

1069
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:46,660
According to my calculations,
Mr. Spicoli,

1070
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:51,760
you wasted a total of, uh,
eight hours of my time this year.

1071
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:56,170
And rest assured,
that is a kind estimate.

1072
01:15:56,240 --> 01:16:00,410
Now I have the unique pleasure
of squaring our account.

1073
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:05,750
Tonight you and I are going to talk in
great detail about the Davis Agreement,

1074
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:10,520
all the associated treaties, and
the American Revolution in particular.

1075
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:15,460
If you can turn to page 47
of Land of Truth and Liberty.

1076
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:19,800
Oh, I left that book in my locker,
Mr. Hand.

1077
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:24,100
In that case, I'm glad I remembered to
bring an extra copy... just for you.

1078
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:28,040


1079
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:53,400
<i> He was a hardheaded man
He was brutally handsome</i>

1080
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:57,230
<i> And she was terminally pretty</i>

1081
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,830
<i> She held him up
and he held her for ransom</i>

1082
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:05,350
<i> In the heart
of the cold, cold city</i>

1083
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:07,070
<i> He had a nasty reputation
as a cruel dude</i>

1084
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:08,580
 Look, Mark.

1085
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:12,590
I want to apologize for
everything that's happened.

1086
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:14,680
I'm really sorry.

1087
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,810
A guy just doesn't do that to a buddy.

1088
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:18,920
I understand.
You can't help it.

1089
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:21,290
You're just lewd,
crude and obnoxious.

1090
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,760
- I can deal with that.
- Excuse me.

1091
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,830
Are we still friends?

1092
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,640
- Huh?
- Okay.

1093
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:37,640
All right.

1094
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:41,350
 What Jefferson
was saying was, "Hey!

1095
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:44,580
"We left this England place
'cause it was bogus.

1096
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:48,550
"So if we don't get some cool rules
ourselves... pronto,

1097
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:51,220
we'll just be bogus too."

1098
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:55,090
Very close, Jeff.

1099
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,370
I think I've made my point with you
tonight.

1100
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:04,560
Do you have a guy like me
in class every year?

1101
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,470
You know,
a guy who you make an example of?

1102
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:10,980
- You'll find out next year.
- No way!

1103
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:14,910
As soon as I cruise history, I'm not
coming near your side of the building.

1104
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:18,110
- "Cruise history"?
- Soon as I pass your class.

1105
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:21,210
Ooh. If you pass.

1106
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:23,690
You're gonna flunk me?

1107
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,220
Don't worry, Spicoli.
You'll probably squeak by.

1108
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:30,320
Yeah! Aloha, Mr. Hand.

1109
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:35,600
Aloha, Spicoli.

1110
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:46,170
Honey,
these are my two star students.

1111
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:48,940
Boys, I'd like you to meet
my wife, Mrs. Vargas.

1112
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,950
Hi.

1113
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:53,510


1114
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,130
Summer!
Yea!

1115
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,830
Totally!


1116
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,570
I wrote him a letter.

1117
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,080
Tell me what you think.
"Dear Doug.

1118
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:18,370
"I received your message that
you weren't coming to my graduation.

1119
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:22,280
"Doug, this is not the kind of thing
that occurs between adults.

1120
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:27,220
"Maybe you've found someone new,
someone more mature.

1121
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:31,350
"But if you ask me, Doug,
you're the one being childish.

1122
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:35,050
"Anyhow, if you think I'm gonna
sit around and wait for you, forget it.

1123
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:38,500
- Sincerely, Linda." What do you think?
- Uh...

1124
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:40,500
I have another version
where I call him an asshole.

1125
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:42,970
No, that one's better.
It's more...

1126
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,970
- Mature?
- Yeah.

1127
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,440
- I don't have to sink to his level.
- Yeah.

1128
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:50,140
- I can go out with anyone I want,
practically.
- That's right.

1129
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:54,110
Yeah.
Thanks for cheering me up.

1130
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,970
Come on.

1131
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:04,750
Hey, dude!
I know that song.

1132
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:18,040
Hey, I'm not.
I'm not.

1133
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:20,370
<i> Mattie told Hattie</i>

1134
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,840
<i> About the things you do</i>

1135
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:25,950
Hey, come on down
from there.

1136
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:28,280
<i> To wooly bully with you</i>

1137
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:31,320
- <i> Wooly bully</i>
- Whaa!

1138
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:32,850
<i> Wooly bully</i>

1139
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:36,550
<i> Wooly bully
Wooly bully</i>

1140
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:39,680
<i> Wooly bully</i>

1141
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,700
<i> Wooly bully, wooly bully
Wooly bully</i>

1142
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:48,600
<i> Wooly bully
Wooly bully</i>

01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:50,500
<i> Wooly bully</i>

1144
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:58,140


1145
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:06,520
Linda, I finally figured it out.

1146
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:10,890
I don't want sex.
Anyone can have sex.

1147
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,490
- What do you want?
- I want a relationship.

1148
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:19,000
- I want romance.
- You want romance?

1149
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:23,090
In Ridgemont? We can't even get
cable TV here, and you want romance.

1150
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:30,030
Another summer at Perry's.
I can't. I swear.

1151
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:32,100
It's not that bad.
Keep your eyes open.

1152
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:34,080
There's lots of men around here.

1153
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,640
<i> As we strolled by the sea</i>

1154
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,250
<i> Together</i>

1155
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:47,090
<i> Under stars twinkling
high above</i>

1156
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:51,720
<i> So in love are we two</i>

1157
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:55,060
<i> No one else but me and you</i>

1158
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:57,330
- <i> So in love</i>
- <i> Two so in love</i>

1159
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,860
- <i> So much in love</i>
- <i> Two so in love</i>

1160
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:03,880
- <i> So in love</i>
- <i> Two so in love</i>

1161
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:07,070
- <i> Are you and I</i>
- <i> Two, you and I</i>

1162
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:09,670
- <i> So in love</i>?
- Hi.

1163
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:12,220
- How you doin'?
- Fine.

1164
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:14,810
I'm glad you came over...

1165
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:17,910
'cause I have this picture of me
that I wanted to give to you...

1166
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:21,330
so that you'll remember
to call me over the summer.

1167
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,200
I don't know. I'm going to be traveling
a lot this summer and I'm not sure...

1168
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:34,000
I'll give you a call sometime.

1169
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:37,070
- That'd be great.
-  Stacy!

1170
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,490
- You worked at All-American Burger!
- Seven months ago.

1171
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:04,700
Uh-huh. 
I knew it.

1172
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,590
Why don't you get a job,
Spicoli?

1173
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:27,720
- What for?
- You need money.

1174
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:31,820
All I need are some tasty waves,

1175
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,090
a cool buzz, and I'm fine.

1176
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:38,500
Thanks.
Can I use your bathroom?

1177
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:42,140
Yeah, go ahead.

1178
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:45,240
- It's the first door on the left.
- Like up this ramp?

1179
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:49,210
First door on the left.

1180
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:57,250
Money, and I want it now.
Now!

1181
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:59,660
- Okay. Okay. Um...
- Now!

1182
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:02,620
What are you doin'?

1183
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:05,220
The safe!
Behind the doughnuts.

1184
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:07,890
I've been watchin' this place.
I know what I'm doin'.

1185
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,600
- Open it up. Open it up!
- Okay.

1186
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:14,370
C'mon! C'mon!

1187
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:18,970
I just started here. They just
taught me the procedure and l...

1188
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:21,310
Let me figure it out.

1189
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:24,980
- Come on, shit head. Let's go.
- Get off my case, motherfucker!

1190
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,280
Hey, no towels, man.

1191
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:30,980


1192
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:36,460
- I got you, you son of a bitch.
- Oh, motherfucker!

1193
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,460
There goes your ride home.

1194
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:41,090
Awesome! Totally awesome!

1195
01:24:41,170 --> 01:24:42,760
All right, Hamilton.

1196
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:59,420
<i> Oh, I know something</i>

1197
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:02,110
<i> About the ways of loving</i>

1198
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:04,660
<i> But I could tell you baby</i>

1199
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:07,320
<i> That something's wrong</i>

1200
01:25:07,390 --> 01:25:13,060
<i> Look to the sky above
and the mud below</i>

1201
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:15,430
<i> Something's driving me crazy</i>

1202

<i> Got to got to get away</i>

1203
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:22,210

goodbye, goodbye, goodbye</i>

1204
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,570
<i> Without a doubt</i>

1205
01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:27,380
<i> I'm telling you
I'm burnt out</i>

1206
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:31,580
<i> My tank is running on empty</i>

1207
01:25:31,650 --> 01:25:34,680
<i> For far too long
I need fuel</i>

1208
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,250
<i> 'Cause I'm getting so low</i>

1209
01:25:38,330 --> 01:25:41,490

1210
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,500

1213
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:08,180
<i> Not the kind you give me</i>

1214
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:10,520
<i> Makes me feel so bad</i>

1215
01:26:10,590 --> 01:26:14,430
