1
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,417
Fury, I'd like you to meet someone.

2
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:10,917
This is Gravik.

3
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,583
Gravik?

4
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,125
<i>You don't trust me.</i>

5
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:24,292
You're telling me
there's a million Skrulls

6
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:26,125
walking amongst us right now?

7
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:29,167
Have you lost your reptilian-ass mind?

8
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,583
<i>Skrulls have infiltrated the ranks
of major world powers.</i>

9
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:34,747
<i>Where is the proof?</i>

10
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:37,792
I nominate Gravik
to the post of Skrull General.

11
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,083
They sent you to fire me?

12
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,333
I volunteered.

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,125
Set up a meet between me and Gravik.

14
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,458
Talos, he will kill you.

15
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:47,250
I wanna talk about my daughter.

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,667
- Everyone ready?
- Uh-huh.

17
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,042
Do you think it'll work?

18
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,167
I mean, uh...

19
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,667
Bringing chaos?

20
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,333
Why did you join the resistance, Beto?

21
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:36,667
Um...

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,750
I did not want our people to keep running.

23
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,667
You joined the same reason I did.

24
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,000
Not fear of the past, faith in our future.

25
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:01,292
All faith is built on risk.

26
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,792
So that's what we have to take. Yeah?

27
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,417
Yeah.

28
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:09,417
Ah!

29
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:11,833
Members of the Council.

30
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,792
Glad you could make it on short notice.

31
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,583
Now at the council meeting,

32
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,375
I told you I had a plan
for taking Earth as our own.

33
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,042
<i>I sent three operatives
to infiltrate the Royal Navy.</i>

34
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,167
Time to change.

35
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,125
<i>And execute a strike
on a key United Nations target.</i>

36
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,667
<i>The heroes of Earth will react.</i>

37
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,333
<i>The only way we can counter that
and claim this planet as our home</i>

38
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,375
<i>is to become super ourselves.</i>

39
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:49,583
Now, we no longer just change faces.

40
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,875
We change powers.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,250
We're gonna be uniquely programmed
weapons of mass destruction.

42
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,417
All of us.

43
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:01,167
Super Skrulls.

44
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:05,667
<i>Humans will be at all-out war
with each other within the week.</i>

45
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:10,000
<i>And while they're at each other's throats,
we're gonna break their backs.</i>

46
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,958
<i>I invite you to join me
in the extinction of the human race.</i>

47
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,750
Coffee?

48
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,750
Yes, please, black.

49
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,292
Looking for someone?

50
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:02,542
Uh, yes, I am.

51
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,542
What does she look like?

52
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,458
That depends
on what day of the week it is.

53
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,625
Wanna sit here while you wait?

54
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,167
Well... That...

55
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,708
That might send the wrong message.

56
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:26,958
She won't mind.

57
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,458
Varra?

58
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,750
This should put Dreykov's men
on their heels.

59
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,083
Looks like you already have.

60
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,417
This new face of yours is...

61
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,125
Beautiful?

62
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,875
I agree.

63
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,542
Who is she?

64
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,083
Well, that depends on where this goes.

65
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,458
No, no, no, no, no.

66
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,958
There's a rule that, you know,

67
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:09,333
commander of station
and operatives cannot be...

68
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:11,458
Our unit doesn't exist, Fury.

69
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,500
That means I don't work for you.

70
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, that's an intriguing possibility.

71
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,917
<i>Does anyone out there
seriously trust our leaders?</i>

72
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,083
<i>I sure don't.</i>

73
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,792
<i>Load your guns and make sure
you got enough food and water</i>

74
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:35,625
<i>because that, my friends,
looks a hell of a lot like World War III.</i>

75
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,625
How can you watch that poison?

76
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,083
Even a broken clock's right twice a day.

77
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,125
Good morning.

78
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,458
Morning!

79
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,250
Mmm! Mmm!

80
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,625
Those eggs supposed to be soft
or hard boiled?

81
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,500
Poached.

82
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,458
I forgot.
Things cook differently up in space.

83
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,000
Whoa. Thank you.

84
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:10,542
Do I dare ask what calamity
must have transpired

85
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,542
to bring you home, to me?

86
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,625
It has been years.

87
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,667
If you want me to apologize
for being gone, Scilla, just say so.

88
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,958
Darling, you are Nick Fury.

89
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,250
I never harbored any illusions
about the necessity of you going away.

90
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,125
But staying away,

91
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:33,042
that leaves a mark.

92
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,792
I retired.

93
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,125
Any plans for the downtime?

94
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,333
Well, you know,
I never cared much for golf, so...

95
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:55,042
I'm thinking I may take up revenge.

96
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,208
You been in touch with Gravik
while I was gone?

97
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,917
- And why are you asking me that?
- 'Cause I just need to be sure.

98
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,333
About what?

99
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,708
Who you've become

100
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,375
while I was gone.

101
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,917
I became a widow in your absence.

102
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,833
I wept on your pillow every night.
I grieved for you.

103
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,750
And just when I thought
I had gotten past the heartbreak,

104
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,708
you came back in the Blip.

105
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:37,208
And silly me, I thought we were
going to undo all the pain together.

106
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,375
Go back to the way we were, but no,

107
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,583
you just up and vanished again.

108
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,000
Only this time it was voluntary.

109
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:54,917
So if you're interested in who I became
in your second absence,

110
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,167
I became me.

111
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,500
The me I was before you.

112
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:04,875
What other choice was there
when you kept disappearing

113
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,542
as if you were never really here
in the first place?

114
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,458
Don't ignore it because of me.

115
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,167
I don't have that information
at hand right now.

116
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,542
You too, take care.

117
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,333
Something important?

118
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:36,792
Nope.

119
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,625
What is it? What's happened?

120
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:12,292
Brogan.

121
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,667
What about him?

122
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:21,208
Well, someone told the cops
where we were headed,

123
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,750
and only we knew that.

124
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:28,000
It was me, you, Pagon and Beto in the car.

125
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:32,542
It's hard for Brogan to confess
to something he didn't know.

126
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,625
Not so hard.

127
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,125
Oh, yeah?

128
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:38,708
How'd you figure?

129
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,333
Brogan under torture.

130
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,833
I'd imagine when they asked him
where they could find you,

131
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,875
he was forced to make an educated guess.

132
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,417
Is that what you'd do?

133
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,583
I'd lie.

134
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,583
I'm a good liar.

135
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,375
Okay.

136
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,167
It was Brogan.

137
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,583
He was weaker than you thought.

138
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:24,708
All right.

139
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:28,625
See you tomorrow. Early.

140
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,458
You're coming with me.

141
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,042
Your father called for a parley.

142
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,000
Apparently we're meeting about you.

143
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah.

144
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,833
Right on schedule.

145
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:28,417
The UN plane will be
at <i>Neptune's</i> coordinates, 2200 hours.

146
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,750
It's remarkable, innit?

147
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:19,500
Gathering up all these big men
for one painting.

148
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,208
<i>Statesmen of World War I.</i>
That's what it's called.

149
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,375
I mean, it just sums up the whole thing
pretty nice, I'd say.

150
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:30,667
Which whole thing is that?

151
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:35,625
You know, the difference
between statesmen and soldiers.

152
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,000
You see, 'cause one lot spends the war
posing for pictures,

153
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,917
while the other does all the killing

154
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,333
and the dying.

155
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:45,208
I mean, look at the fat
smug smile on his face.

156
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:47,292
You ask me, Talos,

157
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:51,292
choice between having my story told
in ink and oil paint

158
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,667
or having it written in blood,

159
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:58,500
I choose blood all day long.

160
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,500
Yours and everyone else's. Huh?

161
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,500
Yeah.

162
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:05,917
Brave.

163
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,875
You asked for parley,
so let's parley, shall we?

164
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,208
Come on.

165
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,583
Thank you, love.

166
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,750
Why don't you just get an empty cup?

167
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,417
I like a little bit of espresso
with my sugar.

168
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,250
You want some?

169
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:52,000
What I want is for you to stand down
and stop murdering innocent humans.

170
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,708
You know, I would be doing us both a favor

171
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,500
if I just put you
out of your misery right here.

172
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:01,375
You want an honor meeting?
Mate, go ahead, say the word.

173
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:02,917
An honor meeting?

174
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,375
Well, it wouldn't be proper, would it?

175
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,667
A general challenging his subordinate
to knives.

176
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,875
Are you honestly puzzled
as to why the Council

177
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,208
would prefer me as general
over the likes of you?

178
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,000
G'iah's in the car. Wanna come say hello?

179
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:20,167
You wanna be very, very careful now.

180
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:21,917
You should be grateful

181
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,792
that I haven't sent her back to you
in a body bag yet.

182
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
That's what this is all about, isn't it?

183
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,875
You're gonna take our people
to the edge of extinction

184
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,208
with the war with the humans.

185
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,167
All these miscreants know

186
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,625
is murder.

187
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,083
Look how they treat each other.

188
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,625
That's what's gonna happen.

189
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,000
We're gonna murder them all.

190
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:12,583
You don't understand
the first thing about humans.

191
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:17,000
They're at their most formidable

192
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,875
when they're threatened

193
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,417
by a common foe.

194
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,500
Have you forgotten how we fight?

195
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,708
You think I'll let you

196
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:30,167
continue this war
under the cover of anonymity,

197
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,583
you're very much mistaken.

198
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm gonna tell every army on Earth
who it is that's attacking them.

199
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,917
You'll lose the element of surprise.

200
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,292
You and your rebels will be put down
like the rabid dogs you are.

201
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,000
Then you'll be the author
of our people's extermination.

202
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,000
And that's where you're wrong,
because you see,

203
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,875
they will see the difference between us

204
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,292
because we will show them,

205
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:56,292
we who haven't been infected
by your sickness.

206
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,125
So, then, G'iah stays with me then, is it?

207
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,542
Now, until the end of time,

208
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,417
my daughter's name
stays out of your mouth.

209
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,042
You got it?

210
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,875
- I'm sorry.
- No, I am.

211
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,917
- I believe this is yours.
- Thank you.

212
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,875
You really gonna eat
that plate of dog food?

213
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,917
I was, mate. I just lost my appetite.

214
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,292
Oh, that's a first.

215
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,833
You really are shameless, aren't you?

216
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,083
Anyone that could say
what you said to me yesterday,

217
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,833
have the balls to come up in here
and ask me for help?

218
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,292
I didn't ask you for help.

219
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,042
What, are you here to have
an English breakfast, mate,

220
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,542
or are you here to inquire
after my well-being?

221
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,958
No, I think it's a pretty safe bet
you ain't here for that, right? Hmm?

222
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,792
Look, look, look, look.

223
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:22,875
I got a lead on a rebel Skrull
that's high up in the U.S. government,

224
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,292
- and he's in London right now.
- And?

225
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,833
And?

226
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,250
Yeah, and what can I do for you?

227
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:31,125
How can I help you, my friend?

228
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,125
I just told you.

229
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,417
No, you told me

230
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,042
that you've got a line on a Skrull
that's up in the U.S. government and...

231
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,875
That it's understood
that you think that implies

232
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,208
that I should just sort of leap up

233
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:46,750
and take this opportunity
to just help you, like that.

234
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:53,125
Those days are gone, so I'm gonna
need you to, you know, use your words.

235
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,292
Say the words.

236
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:57,917
Say what words?

237
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:01,167
"Help me, Talos,

238
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,167
"'cause I'm useless without you."

239
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,500
Help me, Talos,

240
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:29,625
'cause I am useless without you.

241
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:48,000
G'iah handed off intel,
used a burner phone.

242
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,917
Brave girl.

243
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,583
Yeah. Her mum. Good role model.

244
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:57,125
<i>Neptune</i> is a British sub.
I know who to call.

245
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,250
Whoever this is,
you shouldn't have this number.

246
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:07,333
<i>What do you know about</i>
<i>a British submarine called</i> Neptune?

247
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,000
First, I want an apology.

248
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,292
<i>I just gave away
the only one of those I had today.</i>

249
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,208
Well, you'll have to double down,

250
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:17,917
'cause you rather rudely attached
a nasty bug to my beloved Hoot.

251
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,917
<i>Tell me that's not the name
of that owl clock.</i>

252
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:23,250
No, not anymore. Has a new name now.
Nicholas Fury.

253
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:26,208
He has a rather
dashing little eye patch now.

254
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,167
<i>I'm serious, Sonya.
I have it on good authority.</i>

255
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,833
Neptune <i>is planning to launch</i>
<i>on the UN Delegation.</i>

256
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:33,792
<i>That would mean World War III.</i>

257
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,833
<i>Well, why would they
do something silly like that?</i>

258
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,208
Because at least one of Gravik's rebels
has infiltrated Command.

259
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:41,333
<i>Can you make the call?</i>

260
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:43,625
Unfortunately,
I'm dealing with my own infiltration

261
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,042
at the moment.

262
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,292
Somebody leaked the location
of the butcher's shop

263
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:50,208
when I was doing some of my best work,
so my hands are tied.

264
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,000
<i>Loose enough to get the captain's name?</i>

265
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,792
<i>- His name is Commodore Robert Fairbanks.</i>
- Bob!

266
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,208
- Can I get a photo and address?
<i>- Absolutely.</i>

267
00:23:58,292 --> 00:24:01,042
<i>- Shall I tell him you're on your way?</i>
- Yeah. Tell him that.

268
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,083
Portsmouth.

269
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,208
That's where Naval Command HQ is.

270
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:22,083
You know what?
I don't get the whole dog thing.

271
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,208
What's to get?
Dogs are man's best friend.

272
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,458
But I mean, come on, look at that.

273
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:32,875
I mean, just name me
one other interspecies relationship

274
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:36,542
where it's acceptable
to clean up the other guy's poop.

275
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:40,208
I've been cleaning up your poop
for the last 30-some years.

276
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:42,833
Oh, that's rich.

277
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:45,792
Ah, the truth's a mother dog, right?

278
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,208
That's really what you think?

279
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:53,500
That the whole time
we've known each other,

280
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,458
you've been cleaning up my mess?

281
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:58,250
- You got a different take on it?
- Oh, well, let's see.

282
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,417
When I came here in 1995,

283
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,875
you were just a benchwarming nobody
in a dumpy field office in S.H.I.E.L.D.

284
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:06,042
Benchwarming?

285
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,458
What, do you have
a different take on this?

286
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,208
I was ascending the ranks.

287
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:15,042
You didn't start ascending the ranks

288
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:20,750
until me and 19 of my people
signed on as your invisible spy network.

289
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:25,000
You know, we fed you more dirt and intel

290
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:29,500
than you could've uncovered
on your own in a lifetime, so please.

291
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:34,167
I mean, every time you were promoted
inside S.H.I.E.L.D., we did that.

292
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:38,458
Every terror attack you prevented,
we did that.

293
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:43,583
Every enemy you sabotaged
and ally you leveraged with dirt

294
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:47,208
no one else in the world had access to,
we did that.

295
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:52,292
You're a smart and capable guy, Fury.
Nobody questions that.

296
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:54,375
But you've gotta admit,

297
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:58,250
your life got a hell of a lot more charmed
once I came into it.

298
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,000
And do you know something?

299
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:03,250
I don't even need to hear
a bloody thank you from you.

300
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:05,292
It was my pleasure, mate.

301
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:07,417
Least you can do

302
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,292
is not rewrite history

303
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,875
when the guy who helped write it
with you the first time

304
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,708
is sitting right next to you.

305
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,042
- What'd you stop for?
- We're here.

306
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,167
- At Bob's?
- Yeah, Bob.

307
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:23,708
Remember Bob?
The guy that'll launch a nuclear attack?

308
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,708
All right, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that.

309
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:29,750
No, that's 'cause you were too busy
riding the "we did that" wave.

310
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:32,458
You got any more abuse
you wanna hurl my way?

311
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:35,250
Or are you ready to go in here
and take care of Bob?

312
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:38,167
And then I get to say, "We did that."

313
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,750
We can do that.

314
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,167
Sir.

315
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:53,708
Sorry. I didn't know you stepped out.

316
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:56,417
I needed a break
from the old ball and chain.

317
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,667
I can empathize, sir.

318
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,792
Don't let her hear you say that.

319
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,750
<i>You in position?</i>

320
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,708
Worry about your own damn self.

321
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:13,042
<i>Do me a favor, Fury.</i>

322
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:14,792
Don't ever change.

323
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:20,042
- Sir, I just left you...
- Shit.

324
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,375
<i>- I'm blown.</i>
- Yeah, I see.

325
00:27:58,292 --> 00:27:59,375
Come in, Talos.

326
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:03,458
<i>Sorry, Nick.
I was busy kicking Bob's ass.</i>

327
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:06,083
<i>Second floor. Last door down the hall.</i>

328
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:07,750
Copy that.

329
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:27,625
Nobody calls me Nick, Bob.

330
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,417
Zachary.

331
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,875
Dad?

332
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:37,708
Daddy?

333
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:41,625
I'll let him go when you let my son go.

334
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:45,333
This is not a negotiation, Bob.

335
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:00,583
Find something to tie them up?

336
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:03,000
Sure thing, boss.

337
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,125
"Thanks for saving my life, Fury."

338
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:08,458
"No problem, Talos. Any time."

339
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:12,250
What you working on over there, Bob?

340
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:27,500
- Forty-five degrees right.
- To four zero feet.

341
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,875
Standby. Uh, ready one.

342
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:33,583
This has to be a mistake.

343
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:38,167
The message has been authenticated,
Captain. You are obliged to strike.

344
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,125
I'm at a 50 mile radius.

345
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:52,292
Here you go. Take a sip of this.
It's gonna help calm your nerves. Come on.

346
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:56,917
Are you gonna kill my dad?

347
00:29:58,292 --> 00:30:01,250
I just need your dad
to do the right thing. Come on.

348
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:16,250
I can't seem to get old Bob here
to listen to reason.

349
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:18,625
So I'm gonna switch gears.

350
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:20,833
Don't look at him.

351
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:22,875
He's not the one
who's gonna have your wife

352
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:26,333
scraping your purple goopy brains
out of her carpet.

353
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:30,583
Unless you call off the airstrike now.

354
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:34,208
And if you're afraid
of going against Gravik,

355
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,292
I can protect you.

356
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:39,583
You couldn't protect yourself
coming through that door.

357
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,583
You're a shell
of the general you used to be.

358
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,625
Just wait outside?

359
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,375
Why don't you shapeshift back
into this piece of trash

360
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:50,625
and call in an abort
on that missile strike?

361
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:52,792
Great idea. Why didn't I think of that?

362
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:57,333
Maybe 'cause he's the only one
who knows the code word.

363
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:58,875
You got a code for us, Commodore?

364
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,750
You created this vacuum.
All Gravik did is fill it.

365
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:03,417
I want to talk to Cent Com.

366
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
These are Cent Com's orders.

367
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:09,167
Either you obey or you'll be removed.

368
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,458
Do you understand?

369
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:13,292
You could've led together.

370
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:17,458
Gravik offered you a partnership.
We would have stood by you proudly.

371
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,417
So stand with me now.

372
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
You're too late.

373
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,833
Enough of this bull!

374
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:25,042
I'm giving you three seconds

375
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,375
to give me that code,
or I'm gonna aim higher,

376
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:28,917
or maybe lower.

377
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
- Give me the gun.
- One!

378
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,458
- Give me the...
- Two!

379
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:32,750
I said give me that gun!

380
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:36,792
You got minutes to figure out that code
if we can't make your friend here tell us.

381
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:54,917
Prepare to launch.

382
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,917
Getting close
to showtime here, Talos.

383
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,475
Traitors like you are the reason

384
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,750
people have been walking in exile
for 30 years.

385
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,000
- You sicken me.
- Shut up!

386
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,667
What's it gonna be, man?

387
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:12,458
You can't even keep
your daughter's loyalty.

388
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:16,958
Or is she the spineless traitor
feeding you information?

389
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:48,458
<i>What is it?</i>

390
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,292
Commodore Robert Fairbanks.

391
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:53,583
<i>I need his
launch termination password now.</i>

392
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:12,792
- Good evening, friends.
- Operative G'iah. What can we do for you?

393
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:17,208
<i>Initiate go position.</i>

394
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,500
You got it?

395
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,792
Okay. Now run.

396
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,333
Initiating go position.

397
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,875
Initiating go position.

398
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:25,417
<i>Launch sequence underway.</i>

399
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:29,943
This is Fairbanks.

400
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:34,375
Abort exercise.

401
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:37,917
Code word, Zachary.

402
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,125
<i>Abort launch.</i>

403
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,417
<i>Abort launch.</i>

404
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:12,333
- So, why didn't you take the deal?
- What deal?

405
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:14,042
Gravik's.

406
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:16,125
Gotta be hard for you
to be fighting with him

407
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:19,292
when deep down in your bones
you believe in what he's doing.

408
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:23,250
Shit. Thirty years,
you still don't know me better than that?

409
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,750
All right, so make me understand.

410
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:34,583
I'm not with Gravik 'cause I'm with you.

411
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:14,292
Where are you off to, G'iah?

412
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:16,792
I heard about the failed strike.

413
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,917
Our men need exfiltration.

414
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:20,875
I didn't fail.

415
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:23,917
That plane would have been valuable.

416
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,208
Finding the traitor was essential.

417
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,125
Go on, turn around.

418
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:34,417
No.

419
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:37,542
You will look at me.

420
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,875
And you'll ask yourself,

421
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,583
are you a leader of Skrulls

422
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:45,583
or our worst enemy?

423
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:48,458
<i>Platform 17 for the 16:42 to Teddington,</i>

424
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:52,042
<i>calling at Vauxhall, Clapham Junction,
Earlsfield, Wimbledon.</i>

425
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,583
<i>The National!</i>

426
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,667
- I'll give you some time alone.
- Hmm.

427
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,917
<i>St. James Church, one hour.</i>

428
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,333
I need to speak to Gravik.

429
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:58,875
<i>Yeah, well, you're talking to me.</i>
