1
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,125
<i>Yes?</i>

2
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,833
I'll be right there. Don't move.

3
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,875
<i>Imagine a world
where information can't be trusted.</i>

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,708
<i>Not very hard, is it?</i>

5
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,792
<i>News service says one thing,</i>

6
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,250
<i>website says another.</i>

7
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:02,042
<i>Society starts to fray.</i>

8
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:06,792
<i>All we can turn to
are the people we care about.</i>

9
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,250
<i>But what if those people
weren't who we thought they were?</i>

10
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,250
<i>What if the ones closest to us,</i>

11
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,417
<i>the ones we've trusted our whole lives...</i>

12
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:23,417
<i>were someone else entirely?</i>

13
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:29,750
<i>What if they weren't even human?</i>

14
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,417
Agent Prescod, respectfully...

15
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,042
Uh, what exactly are you talking about?

16
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,917
Chaos.

17
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:47,917
And that's only the beginning.

18
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,958
Five global terrorist strikes
within the past year.

19
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:54,292
Each one claimed by a different group.

20
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,000
It's business as usual.

21
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,083
That's precisely
what they want you to think.

22
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:04,042
Argentina attacks Colombia,
Colombia attacks the Philippines.

23
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,375
A violent chain reaction
consuming the globe.

24
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,542
Do you realize
that the entire world is at war?

25
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,042
Well, the atmosphere has been tense.

26
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,042
There is an architect to that tension,
Agent Ross.

27
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,083
These attacks are escalating.

28
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:19,958
If they hit the soil
of the major power... Oh.

29
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:23,792
So you... You think the same people
are behind all of this?

30
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,792
Not people...

31
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,083
Skrulls.

32
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:34,208
Come on, Ross, you know the stories.

33
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,500
This didn't start yesterday.

34
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,292
It started 30 years ago
when the Skrulls found Earth.

35
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:44,000
Carol Danvers and Nick Fury
promised to find them a new planet.

36
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,042
But now...

37
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,917
Now they don't want just any planet,
they want ours.

38
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,333
Look, can't you see it?

39
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:56,167
All these groups, they're the same.

40
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,292
Skrulls could be anybody,
anywhere, at any time.

41
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,750
And there is only a tiny handful
known to live on Earth.

42
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,583
- That's barely enough to...
- To what?

43
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,375
You have no goddamn idea
what you're talking about, Ross!

44
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,750
There could be thousands of them,
tens of thousands!

45
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,375
And you would never know.

46
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:20,667
Okay, Prescod, let's play a little game
of forest for the trees, shall we?

47
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,167
Yes, Skrulls can shapeshift.
Yes, they're looking for a new home.

48
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,833
But, as you say,

49
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,792
the only Skrull contact
has been through Nick Fury.

50
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,542
That means they're our allies.

51
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:34,625
Then where is Fury?

52
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,083
He's on S.A.B.E.R.!

53
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:40,333
God... And if I'm gonna bring him down
for whatever the hell this is,

54
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:44,083
I need to give him something
more than just theories, I need evidence.

55
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,708
All these other attacks,

56
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:01,292
they would be nothing compared to this.

57
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:06,292
This is the one
that sets the world on fire.

58
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,292
I stopped filing reports at the office.
Don't know who I can trust anymore.

59
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,708
Other than you...

60
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:34,083
Hey, Prescod, look,
I'm here to help. Okay?

61
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:39,542
So... So let me take this
and I'll give the information to Fury.

62
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,750
Okay?

63
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,250
Yeah.

64
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,708
I need an extract. Fast.

65
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:36,708
<i>I need an extract.</i>

66
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,708
Academica Metro Station,
six blocks northeast.

67
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,250
Ross.

68
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,833
Show me your hands.

69
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,458
- Talos.
- It's me.

70
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,125
What the hell are you doing here?

71
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,292
I'm chasing him.

72
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:37,750
He was one of you.

73
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,208
No, he's...

74
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,958
He... He's one of them.

75
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:18,750
Welcome back to Earth.

76
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,750
{\an8}He's upstairs.

77
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,333
Is that from home?

78
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,167
Santo Millika.

79
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,583
That's a Skrull sky plant.

80
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,208
Soren. She brought the seed with her
wherever she went.

81
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:03,125
And it's changed since she planted it.
It's adapted to the planet.

82
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,917
Yeah, well,
you always believed that was possible.

83
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,042
I still do.

84
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,042
I am so sorry.

85
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:20,625
Me, too.

86
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,542
Soren loved you.

87
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,792
But she worried, mate,

88
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:30,583
that it would take something like this
to bring you back to Earth.

89
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,125
And I guess she was right.

90
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,167
Tell me about Gravik.

91
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,917
Let's... Let's just
talk about you first, yeah?

92
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:52,708
We've been helping you for all these years
to ensure that you kept your promise.

93
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,875
But after The Blip, you were different.

94
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,875
And then you disappeared.

95
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:05,625
Carol Danvers disappeared.

96
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,833
And so did G'iah.

97
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,917
Hold it. Your daughter?
Disappeared too... Where?

98
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,125
She was young.

99
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,625
Angry that our people
still don't have a home.

100
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:17,583
Many of them are upset.

101
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:22,125
I got kicked off the Council,
pushed into exile.

102
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,250
But, Gravik...

103
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:31,750
Gravik, mate, he took your abandonment
that much harder.

104
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,417
Come on.

105
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,917
Gravik is now the newest member
of the Skrull Council.

106
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,833
He preys on the collective rage
of young, displaced Skrulls.

107
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,167
Where is his ass?

108
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,833
He's here. He's in Russia.

109
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:47,875
Skrulls are immune to radioactivity

110
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,792
and Russia has the most abandoned
nuclear plants on Earth.

111
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:55,167
But here's the thing.
These plants, they're not on the books.

112
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,750
And we don't know where he is.

113
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,958
Well, what else do we know
about his plans?

114
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,250
Well, he's already made them.

115
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,250
This is what Agent Ross's imposter
was trying to cover up.

116
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,458
Schematics for a dirty bomb
intercepted by Prescod.

117
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:13,083
Prescod had been monitoring
a new radical group called the AAR,

118
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:14,458
Americans Against Russia,

119
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:18,208
which he believed to be the next
Skrull front for a terrorist attack.

120
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:21,750
Gravik's trying to start a war between
Russia and the United States?

121
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,000
That was Prescod's theory.

122
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,000
And he's gonna use this bomb to do it?

123
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,625
Does he have the materials for that?

124
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,000
A weapons cache in Kazakhstan,

125
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,500
raided the same day
that Prescod was killed.

126
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,167
We brought you here for a reason.

127
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,167
If he succeeds, um,

128
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,250
your species will cease to exist.

129
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:46,958
Shit.

130
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,167
I'm going for a walk.

131
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:52,042
You're going for a walk in Moscow
at night?

132
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,667
Well, you're gonna stand out.

133
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,375
We have a situation,
Mr. President.

134
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,292
- Concerning?
- Agent Fury.

135
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,335
We've just received word
that he's left S.A.B.E.R.

136
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,125
What do you mean, "He left S.A.B.E.R.?"

137
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,083
Well, I can try to think of
a different word. Abandoned, departed...

138
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:15,375
Agent Fury is building up the most
complex aerospace defense system

139
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,083
in the history of mankind.

140
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,125
- He can't just leave.
- No, I agree, sir.

141
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,333
And unfortunately,

142
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:24,042
we also intercepted an encrypted message
from Agent Hill to Agent Fury.

143
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,917
We haven't been able to decode it yet,
but we know they're old friends.

144
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,917
Given the fact that I could reach
neither Agent Hill nor Agent Fury,

145
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:34,750
they're effectively AWOL.

146
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:36,625
Deal with it.

147
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,792
Yes, sir.

148
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,875
This is so exciting.

149
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,167
Let's see, large Black man, Moscow.

150
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,458
Well, it could either be Nick Fury,
or the ghost of Paul Robeson.

151
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,250
Okay, go ahead, take the hood off.

152
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:02,583
Oh! Damn, and I was hoping for a command
performance of <i>Ol' Man River.</i>

153
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,125
Good to see you too, Sonya.

154
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:11,292
So, did you just have me extraordinarily
renditioned by a group of your thugs?

155
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,792
Were you lot extraordinary?

156
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,458
Oh!

157
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:17,042
You usually only
scratch the surface of mediocrity.

158
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,042
You must be finally
putting it all together. Well done.

159
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,083
Okay. You can go. That's... That'll do.

160
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,167
"Extraordinary," well, that's wonderful.

161
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,667
It is so good to see you.

162
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,542
You look amazing.

163
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,750
Thanks.

164
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:40,167
- Drink?
- Love one.

165
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,500
Do you have some sort of clock fetish
that you've been

166
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,042
keeping from me all these years?

167
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,292
It was an old English spymaster
that started the tradition.

168
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,083
A clock goes up
when your time in circus is done.

169
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:56,958
And I like to think I still have
a few juggling acts left in me.

170
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,833
Oh. Make yourself at home, Fury.

171
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,542
I'm pretty sure you recollect
my drink of choice as bourbon.

172
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,167
I might have welcomed you home,

173
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,042
but I still haven't forgiven you
for destroying my expensive flat.

174
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,250
You mean city.

175
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,125
It's bottom shelf piss for you or nothing.

176
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,250
So, what are you doing in Moscow?

177
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,917
Same as you, trying to kill
the Skrull rebellion in its crib.

178
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,750
You know the rebel leader personally,
don't you?

179
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,833
I knew him.

180
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:38,500
Is that why you came down
from your space station?

181
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,375
You feel responsible?

182
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,583
What do you know about a heist

183
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:52,292
at a black market storage facility
in Kazakhstan?

184
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,708
It happened couple days ago.

185
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,042
Doesn't ring a bell.

186
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:03,583
You know, I may not know
when a Skrull is pretending to be a human,

187
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:07,083
but I sure as hell know
when a human is lying.

188
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,917
You know damn well
what was in that storage vault.

189
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,792
The fact that you don't know

190
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,083
tells me all I need to know
about this new, rather old Nick Fury.

191
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,500
I think that Thanos's snap changed you.

192
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,333
Taught you that no matter
how hard you fight for what's right,

193
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:23,958
there's always someone stronger
to undermine you.

194
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,958
You seem to forget this "old Nick Fury"

195
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:31,250
has 30 years
of hands-on experience with the Skrulls.

196
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,542
I know the nature of this threat
way better than you ever will.

197
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,833
Is that your idea of an offer
of some sort of collaboration between us?

198
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:42,375
We used to work pretty well together
back in the day.

199
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,083
Back then, you would've seen
my rather mediocre bag men

200
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,292
coming a mile away.

201
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,333
The fact that you didn't see them

202
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:51,875
means you haven't a hope in hell
of seeing Gravik and his rebels coming.

203
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,542
Which makes you as a partner
rather pointless.

204
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,958
I let your men take me
so I could get to you.

205
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:02,208
I mean this as a friend, Fury,
but go back to your space station.

206
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,583
You're in no shape
for this fight that lies before us.

207
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,125
I'll have one of my thugs
drop you back at the safe house.

208
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,667
That's all right, I'll walk.

209
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,750
If your memory jogs about
that Kazakhstan thing,

210
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:20,917
call a brother.

211
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,667
What do you want?

212
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:45,583
Home in my own skin.

213
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,208
Take your natural form.

214
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,708
Welcome to New Skrullos.

215
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,083
What's your name?

216
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,833
Beto.

217
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,292
When's the last time you ate, Beto?

218
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,708
I don't know.

219
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,833
This can't be.

220
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,750
We grow only Skrull produce here.

221
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,750
Drink Skrull wine, wear Skrull skins.

222
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:30,250
Whatever dangers you risked getting here,
know, they're worth it.

223
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:41,208
Thank you.

224
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,375
You're very welcome.

225
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,333
We're over 500 strong now.

226
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,792
So, is everyone a part of...

227
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,583
The resistance? No.
Gravik provides refuge.

228
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:47,500
But if you do choose to be a warrior,
there is one advantage.

229
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,125
Oh, yeah? What's that?

230
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,375
You get to leave.

231
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,833
Everyone else stays in the compound.

232
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,417
The warriors keep our human form,
the longer we're attached to our shells,

233
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,167
the less likely we can be identified
by humans and Skrulls alike.

234
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,875
Wait here
and someone will get you a proper room.

235
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:10,667
Prove your loyalty
and Gravik will reward you.

236
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,625
What's behind there?

237
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Victory.

238
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,000
What is your name?

239
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,375
Warrior.

240
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:47,875
What is your fight?

241
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,000
Skrullos.

242
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,375
What is your dream?

243
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,542
Home in my own skin.

244
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:57,417
Bring him his shell.

245
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,250
No. No!

246
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,792
Americans Against Russia,
your dreams are about to come true.

247
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:12,583
Take his face.

248
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:21,625
No!

249
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:31,875
Now take his mind.

250
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,167
Skrulls have infiltrated
the ranks of major world powers.

251
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,750
<i>Where is the proof?</i>

252
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,750
<i>How about the arrival of Agent Fury?</i>

253
00:25:56,833 --> 00:26:00,167
<i>For a man who sworn off Earth,
he would not have returned without cause.</i>

254
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,542
You got that right.

255
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:04,708
<i>Gravik has something very big
up his sleeve.</i>

256
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:07,417
<i>But the immediate threat
remains the bombs.</i>

257
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,125
<i>Five specialists in Moscow
are capable of building such an explosive.</i>

258
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:12,667
<i>My money's on this one.</i>

259
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,792
<i>Vasily Poprishchin.
Former Chechnyan rebel,</i>

260
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,875
<i>owns a high-end gallery
in the city center,</i>

261
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:21,333
<i>restores pigmented paintings
and radioactivated bombs.</i>

262
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:23,125
<i>Send in a raid now.</i>

263
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,500
<i>If by "now" you mean,</i>

264
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,000
<i>"Wait until a Skrull rebel
picks up a device</i>

265
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:30,500
<i>in order to follow them to their hideout,"
then, yes, I totally agree.</i>

266
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:32,708
She's cheeky.

267
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:35,167
Yeah, 'till she sees
an ugly-ass Skrull like you.

268
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,750
Then she goes into hunting mode.

269
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,625
I'm considered good-looking
amongst my kind.

270
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:42,375
I know a bunch of good-looking Skrull.
And you ain't one of them.

271
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:44,375
All right, guys,
what is the play here?

272
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:46,958
I say we visit this Rusky bomb builder.

273
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:48,792
Sonya will already have agents there.

274
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,583
Who we will incapacitate.

275
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:51,792
Hold on, stop.

276
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:56,125
You're talking about
attacking MI6 operatives?

277
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:58,167
Talos,
let me explain something to you.

278
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,875
We're no longer
in "just a war" with Gravik.

279
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:05,417
We are in a race with Sonya Falsworth,
who celebrates a scorched-Earth policy,

280
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,875
meaning, she will annihilate
any and everyone

281
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:10,375
who's ever even heard the name "Gravik."

282
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:13,542
You wanna save innocent Skrulls,
you'll have to hurt some people.

283
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:14,625
All right...

284
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:16,417
Look, Gravik knows that...

285
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,375
mercy's your weakness.

286
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:20,667
Time for you to prove him wrong.

287
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,750
Hmm?

288
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:24,667
Yeah, okay.

289
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,125
Fury's in town, G.

290
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:51,625
Is he?

291
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,792
Our man says it's nothing to worry about.

292
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:58,250
He's washed up, walks with a limp,
can barely see with the good eye.

293
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:01,583
I see you've kept the circle tight
on this one.

294
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:04,833
We're the circle. No one else.

295
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,250
Is that to protect me, or the cause?

296
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:15,667
You are the cause.

297
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,958
I'm not the cause.

298
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,875
Cause is home.

299
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:21,542
Yes, sir.

300
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:26,292
We go tomorrow
and we don't stop until Earth is ours.

301
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,083
- What about it?
- This place is massive.

302
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:34,167
You.

303
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:35,833
Come with me.

304
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,042
Zirksu will drive you.

305
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:47,542
You take the cash to this address.

306
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,792
You deal with Poprishchin and no one else.

307
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,208
He'll give you two bags.

308
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:54,250
You get 'em to the Moscow safe house
undisturbed and intact.

309
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,833
Where's the bloody coffee?

310
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:45,958
What's our MI6 status?

311
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:52,958
All set.

312
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:08,167
You Poprishchin?

313
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:17,417
- Oh, shit.
- I got it, mate.

314
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,375
Not bad for a 136-year-old.

315
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:26,917
Well, you know,
I'm not even 40 in human years.

316
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,208
I haven't even gone
on my midlife crisis shopping spree yet.

317
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:31,958
Hey.

318
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,292
What'd you get for yours?

319
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,833
The Avengers.

320
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,333
No, mate, we don't want
any of your shitty paintings.

321
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,625
Then exactly what do you want?

322
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:04,042
Some damn good answers.

323
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,458
I've got eyes
on a possible person of interest.

324
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:20,500
Initiating foot pursuit.
I'll keep you posted.

325
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:21,875
Yeah, just keep me informed.

326
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:25,500
I'm sorry, but you gentlemen
will have to call at another time.

327
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,292
- I'm late for an appointment.
- Oh! Oh, who you meetin' with?

328
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,917
My wife, Mister...

329
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,083
Oh!

330
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,000
Ooh! Damn, this is nice.

331
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:36,042
That chair belonged to Louis XV.
It's priceless.

332
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:40,167
Everything is priceless till it gets
blown to bits in a hail of bullets.

333
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:45,292
Agent Keller, anything in our file
about this one having a wife?

334
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,208
Yeah, has an ex-wife,

335
00:31:47,292 --> 00:31:49,417
lives in Miami with a soccer player.

336
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:54,333
Oh, so we gonna go ahead
and call that a lie.

337
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:56,250
Everybody gets one.

338
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,542
Nobody gets two.

339
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,958
So, last chance.

340
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:04,500
Who are you going to meet?

341
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,042
Perhaps we'd all be more comfortable
in the gallery space

342
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,667
where there is more natural light.

343
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,125
You got any more of these comfortable-ass
Louis XIV chairs in there?

344
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:15,292
Mmm-mmm.

345
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:16,667
How about a dirty bomb?

346
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,833
Or you keep that in a crate
in here somewhere?

347
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:23,708
I'm sorry, I do not know this term.
Dirty bomb?

348
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:26,792
Boom, goes the dynamite! Lie number two.

349
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:32,458
I just told you.
Everybody gets one, nobody gets two.

350
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:34,583
You going to shoot me?

351
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:37,250
Maybe. Well, probably.

352
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,542
But not right now.

353
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,000
Where are the bombs?

354
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,542
Your name's not Keller.

355
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:52,792
Skrull.

356
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:54,125
Your name is Talos.

357
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:58,917
Talos?

358
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,083
I got this.

359
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:02,250
You sure?

360
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:09,917
This is my fight!

361
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,667
I said no!

362
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:27,750
Tell me where the bombs are!

363
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,667
You betray your own people.

364
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,750
Come on.

365
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:54,542
I said no.

366
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,292
Where'd he go?

367
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:20,542
She.

368
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:27,208
Stop! Stop! Stop!

369
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:30,375
Last warning!

370
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,333
It's what you always say
but there's always another.

371
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,208
G'iah.

372
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,833
- Give me the bombs.
- No.

373
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,958
I know you're angry. This isn't you.

374
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:58,500
This is not
what your mother would've wanted.

375
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:00,500
Mum doesn't know what she wants.

376
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:05,250
Her last words, "Find G'iah."

377
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,083
What?

378
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:12,708
She's dead.

379
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,292
How?

380
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,250
Why don't you ask
the people that you work for?

381
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:33,083
Why don't you
just give me the bomb, please?

382
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:38,417
G'iah, give me the bomb.

383
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:42,792
- I can't.
- Just hand it over.

384
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,000
And you'll walk away.

385
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:48,125
'Cause you know that I'll protect you.

386
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:51,792
- You can't protect anyone.
- G'iah, I know...

387
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:37,809
Making friends with the locals?

388
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:45,083
How do you think
we kept the Cold War from going hot?

389
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:48,250
Spooks like me buying shots.

390
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,708
You can't say that.

391
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:51,958
No. You can't say that.

392
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,125
Mmm!

393
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,208
It's good to have you back, Fury.

394
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:06,042
Is that sincere
or you just covering your bases?

395
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,833
You'll tell me why you abandoned Earth?

396
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:10,250
Well, building out S.A.B.E.R.

397
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:13,417
Traditionally, we tell the truth
during our chess games.

398
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,750
Maybe that has changed too, though,
I don't know.

399
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:22,083
Okay, let's just say
I had a crisis of faith.

400
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,500
So why'd you come back?

401
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,208
It followed me up there,

402
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:31,125
and I owe it to Talos.

403
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,542
You sure you're not talking
about someone else?

404
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,083
You gonna move?

405
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,333
I haven't decided.

406
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,625
See, that's what I'm worried about.

407
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,583
The Fury I knew
was always three steps ahead.

408
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:56,292
If I remember correctly, you called me.

409
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:58,458
Upon Talos's request.

410
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:03,250
Your lack of contact over the past
few years sent a pretty clear message.

411
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,583
Meaning?

412
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:13,333
You're not ready for this, Fury.

413
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,750
There's a very real threat out there.

414
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:20,125
You were never the same after The Blip.

415
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:23,208
You always told me there is no shame

416
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:26,500
in walking away
when the steps are uncertain.

417
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,500
So check your footing.

418
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,542
Otherwise someone's gonna get hurt.

419
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:47,625
Oh, no.

420
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:50,042
Mother...

421
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:24,792
Good work.

422
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,917
I barely made it out.
Someone was waiting for me.

423
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,458
Someone you can identify?

424
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,625
No.

425
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:36,875
Maybe we postpone the strike.

426
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:43,250
To the contrary.
Thanks to you, we have the bait.

427
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,125
Thanks for coming to see me.

428
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:59,208
You don't see me because I'm not here.

429
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:01,750
I understand. You're taking a risk.

430
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,250
A risk?

431
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:07,917
Is that what you explained to Mum,
that following you could get her killed?

432
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,250
Your mother died
while you were working for her killer.

433
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:17,083
So do not take me down that road, G'iah.

434
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:20,458
You have one chance to save yourself.

435
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:22,125
And I think you know that.

436
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,875
I think that's why you're here.

437
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,500
The attack is planned for tomorrow.

438
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:36,708
Unity Day.

439
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:41,833
There are three bombs.
And Gravik knows you'll be there.

440
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:44,375
- How?
- I don't know.

441
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,625
There are so many operatives in the field.
A hundred, at least.

442
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:50,542
Fracking pods?

443
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:53,583
Most of their identities are kept secret,
even from us.

444
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:03,750
Your mum would be very proud of you,
you know, for coming to see me.

445
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:14,292
Tomorrow, there are three couriers,
including me.

446
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:16,958
All the points
near Vossoyedineniye Square.

447
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:20,042
I'll mark each bag with infrared spray.

448
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,875
G'iah's come back.

449
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:57,458
I got eyes on her.

450
00:44:58,667 --> 00:45:00,083
<i>Two backpacks.</i>

451
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:02,875
I got her.

452
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:05,333
Remember we're tracking the bags,
not the people.

453
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,375
Lot of backpacks in Central Moscow.

454
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:11,625
G'iah's painted ours with infrared spray.

455
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:13,958
Infrared. Got it.

456
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:28,208
We missed the pass.

457
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,375
Got one carrier going northeast.

458
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,458
The other one south. Let's move.

459
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:50,000
Excuse me. Excuse me!

460
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:06,333
It's empty. They're decoys.

461
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:51,792
Hill!

462
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:32,708
- Maria!
- It was you.

463
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:34,542
Not me.
