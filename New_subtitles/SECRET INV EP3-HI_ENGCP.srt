Why don't you just get an empty cup?

181
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,417
I like a little bit of espresso
with my sugar.

182
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,250
You want some?

183
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:52,000
What I want is for you to stand down
and stop murdering innocent humans.

184
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,708
You know, I would be doing us both a favor

185
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,500
if I just put you
out of your misery right here.

186
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:01,375
You want an honor meeting?
Mate, go ahead, say the word.

187
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:02,917
An honor meeting?

188
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,375
Well, it wouldn't be proper, would it?

189
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,667
A general challenging his subordinate
to knives.

190
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,875
Are you honestly puzzled
as to why the Council

191
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,208
would prefer me as general
over the likes of you?

192
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,000
G'iah's in the car. Wanna come say hello?

193
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:20,167
You wanna be very, very careful now.

194
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:21,917
You should be grateful

195
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,792
that I haven't sent her back to you
in a body bag yet.

196
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
That's what this is all about, isn't it?

197
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,875
You're gonna take our people
to the edge of extinction

198
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,208
with the war with the humans.

199
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,167
All these miscreants know

200
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,625
is murder.

201
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,083
Look how they treat each other.

202
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,625
That's what's gonna happen.

203
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,000
We're gonna murder them all.

204
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:12,583
You don't understand
the first thing about humans.

205
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:17,000
They're at their most formidable

206
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,875
when they're threatened

207
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,417
by a common foe.

208
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,500
Have you forgotten how we fight?

209
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,708
You think I'll let you

210
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:30,167
continue this war
under the cover of anonymity,

211
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,583
you're very much mistaken.

212
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm gonna tell every army on Earth
who it is that's attacking them.

213
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,917
You'll lose the element of surprise.

214
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,292
You and your rebels will be put down
like the rabid dogs you are.

215
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,000
Then you'll be the author
of our people's extermination.

216
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,000
And that's where you're wrong,
because you see,

217
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,875
they will see the difference between us

218
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,292
because we will show them,

219
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:56,292
we who haven't been infected
by your sickness.

220
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,125
So, then, G'iah stays with me then, is it?

221
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,542
Now, until the end of time,

222
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,417
my daughter's name
stays out of your mouth.

- I'm sorry.
- No, I am.

- I believe this is yours.
- Thank you.

227

You really gonna eat
that plate of dog food?

228
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,917
I was, mate. I just lost my appetite.

229

Anyone that could say
what you said to me yesterday,

233
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,833
have the balls to come up in here
and ask me for help?

234
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,292
I didn't ask you for help.

235
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,042
What, are you here to have
an English breakfast, mate,

236
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,542
or are you here to inquire
after my well-being?

237
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,958
No, I think it's a pretty safe bet
you ain't here for that, right? Hmm?

238
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,792
Look, look, look, look.

239
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:22,875
I got a lead on a rebel Skrull
that's high up in the U.S. government,

240
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,292
- and he's in London right now.
- And?

241
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,833
And?

242
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,250
Yeah, and what can I do for you?

243
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:31,125
How can I help you, my friend?

244
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,125
I just told you.

245
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,417
No, you told me

246
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,042
that you've got a line on a Skrull
that's up in the U.S. government and...

247
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,875
That it's understood
that you think that implies

248
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,208
that I should just sort of leap up

249
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:46,750
and take this opportunity
to just help you, like that.

250
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:53,125
Those days are gone, so I'm gonna
need you to, you know, use your words.

251
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,292
Say the words.

252
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:57,917

<i>I just gave away

Well, you'll have to double down,

When I came here in 1995,

305

in a dumpy field office in S.H.I.E.L.D.

You didn't start ascending the ranks

310
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:20,750
until me and 19 of my people
signed on as your invisible spy network.

311

You know, we fed you more dirt and intel

312
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:29,500
than you could've uncovered
on your own in a lifetime, so please.

313

inside S.H.I.E.L.D., we did that.

All right, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that.

332

No, that's 'cause you were too busy
riding the "we did that" wave.

you wanna hurl my way?

Or are you ready to go in here
and take care of Bob?
