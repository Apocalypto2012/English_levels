1
00:00:54,825 --> 00:01:01,832


2
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,175
At the outset, I believe you have a
statement you should read in the record.

3
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,176
Yes, Your Honor.

4
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:31,300
We are not judges, doctor.

5
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,175
Your Honor

6
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,700
Naturally.

7
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,175
Who is the security point?

8
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,500
The so-called
investigative information.

9
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,375
Your charge against
me says it's impossible.

10
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,300
I understand this quite well outside
the context of my life and work.

11
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,175
How long did he testify?

12
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,300
To be honest, I don't remember.

13
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,575
The whole process
took one month.

14
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,175
Time to know?

15
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,300
I only read the transcripts.

16
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,175
I want to justify their life.

17
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,176
You were not there?

18
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:11,225
I was not allowed to
do that as president.

19
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,175
Will they really ask?

20
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,175
Years ago

21
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,176
Four years ago.

22
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:18,175
I meant.

23
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,175
Oppenheimer is
still dividing America.

24
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,175
The Committee will want
to know what his position is.

25
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,325
Senator Thoreau,
don't ask me not to hear.

26
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,425
like in court.

27
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,175
No, it works
differently, just sit down.

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,300
Really, Mr. Thoreau?

29
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,175
Absolutely yes.

30
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,245
Admiral Thoreau is an image.

31
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,175
Toto is a formality.

32
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,175
President Eisenhower has
asked you to join his cabinet.

33
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,175
The Senate has no
choice but to confirm it.

34
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,175
And who should they
confirm, Oppenheimer?

35
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,245
When they brought
up Oppenheimer.

36
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,175
Answer honestly.

37
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,225
No senator can deny it.

38
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,350
He accomplished your mission.

39
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,275
He will be uncomfortable.

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,334
We will justify all their lives.

41
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,567
Why don't you leave
the United States?

42
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,300
I wanted to study a new physics.

43
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,225
Was it nowhere to be found?

44
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,575
I thought Berkeley had a major
theoretical physics department.

45
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,175
Yes, one side built it.

46
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,875
First I had to go to Europe.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,625
I went to Cambridge to
study with Patrick Blackett.

48
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,175
You are happier
there than in America.

49
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,175
Happier?

50
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,700
Yes.

51
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,175
NO.

52
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:34,307
No, I'm... nostalgic,
emotionally mature,

53
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:42,165
Visions of the human
universe disturb me.

54
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:49,307
You heard laughing.

55
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:02,175
Hi Oppenheimer

56
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,700
Are you sleeping?

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,175
Restart

58
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,300
I have to go to class, sir.

59
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,175
Why?

60
00:04:12,300 --> 00:07:50,176
It reeks of boredom.

61
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:18,175
I think he's gone.

62
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,175
Naturally.

63
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,300
Let's go

64
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,175
You are not strong, Oppenheimer.

65
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,500
You have completed
the Coachman's Seat.

66
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,175
Quantum physics
is not a step forward.

67
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,175
It is a new way of
understanding reality.

68
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,176
Einstein opened the door.

69
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:19,175
Now we look through you, we
see the world in us the world is

70
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:25,300
a world of energy and paradoxes
that not everyone can accept.

71
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,175
Naturally.

72
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,175
Fields, meet J.
Robert Oppenheimer.

73
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
What does the
abbreviation J stand for?

74
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,175
Nothing.  Nothing at all.

75
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,225
You are in my class.

76
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,525
Ask the only good question.

77
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,175
No one denies his understanding.

78
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,175
This is laboratory work
that requires some willpower.

79
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,176
I've heard him give
the same answer.

80
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,475
Yes, and you are
asking the same question.

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,175
Why are you asking me again?

82
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,300
I want your answer.

83
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,175
Did you like it better yesterday?

84
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,300
Too

85
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,605
You can lift a stone
without they were

86
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,175
ready for the serpent
that appeared.

87
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,425
Now you look ready.

88
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,175
But you don't like the lab.

89
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,175
So walk out of Cambridge
with every glass and potion.

90
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,034
Go to a place that
makes you think.

91
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,175
you have to be born.

92
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,175
Go to Germany.

93
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,176
Works under Max Born.

94
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:01,225
Learn the methods of the theory.

95
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,300
I will send a message

96
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,300
Or more.

97
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,175
How are you doing with math?

98
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,300
He's not good enough.

99
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,175
The physicist he wanted to be.

100
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,275
Notes similar to algebra.

101
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,175
It is not important that you
know how to read music.

102
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
Have you heard?

103
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,300
Can you hear the music, Robert?

104
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,600
Yes, I feel it.

105
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:02,175
I am interested as Admiral
Strauss, Senator from Wyoming.

106
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,225
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

107
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,175
Did you meet him in 1947?

108
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Right.

109
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,175
Was he a commissioner of
the Atomic Energy Commission?

110
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,225
I was, but I actually
met Robert at an event.

111
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,325
Board member of the
Institute for Advanced Studies.

112
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,175
World crown at Princeton after the
war, he was a great metaphysician.

113
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,300
I was determined to get
him to run the institute.

114
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:37,657
Dr. Oppenheimer, Mr

115
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,175
Strauss.

116
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,175
Pronounced Strauss.

117
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,367
Open, Hagar, the name of the war
you served and the land of the Jews.

118
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,225
I am the president of the
Manuel Manhattan Temple.

119
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,275
Strauss is just a
sudden pronunciation.

120
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,395
Anyway, welcome
to the institute.

121
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,175
I think you will be
very happy here.

122
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,175
Yes, if you like
the community, the

123
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,500
escort comes to that
house for your wife

124
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,175
and your two children

125
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,176
Yes, two.

126
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:08,175
I'm a big fan of your work.

127
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,275
I am very correct about
the education of Mr. Strauss.

128
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,175
Excuse me, I'm
calling the room at four.

129
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,175
You know I'm not trained in physics
or anything, and now I'm on my own.

130
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,175
I can tell it like this.

131
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,275
Really?

132
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,175
Yes, my father was.

133
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,300
This would be your office.

134
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:31,707
It seems that most of
them exist after that too.

135
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,609
You know, I've
always wondered why.

136
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:43,300
did not include it in
the Manhattan Project.

137
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,175
of time.

138
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,167
Einstein published
the theory of relativity.

139
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,175
More than 40 years ago.

140
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,325
I remember it was quite
moral and informative.

141
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,300
God does not roll dice.

142
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,175
Exactly.

143
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,300
I've never considered
studying physics, Mr. Strauss.

144
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,175
I had writers, but I
decided to sell shoes.

145
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,475
Louis Strauss was a
men's shoe salesman.

146
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,300
Not just a shoe salesman.

147
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,300
I would like to introduce you.

148
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Louis.

149
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,300
I've known him for years.

150
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:28,507
Albert.

151
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:50,175
What was it?

152
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,175
What did you say, O?

153
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,225
Is fine.

154
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:02,275
Mr. Strauss, you should
know something about my past.

155
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,375
As head of the ADC, I have access
to his security file at Red Hood.

156
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,175
You are not worried.

157
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,875
After all you've done for your
country, why should I be afraid?

158
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,176
Times have changed, Mr. Strauss.

159
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:14,300
Well, the purpose
of this institute.

160
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,175
provide a haven for
independent minds.

161
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,176
You are

162
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:21,300
You are the right
man for this job.

163
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,300
Well, I don't think about it.

164
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,875
See you tomorrow
at the ADC meeting.

165
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,007
This is one of the most prestigious
nominations in the country.

166
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,176
Yes.

167
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:36,175
Great trip

168
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,300
That's why I'm thinking.

169
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,175
Did Dr. Rabinheimer
draw your attention to

170
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,300
past associations before
she mentioned him?

171
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,375
Yes.

172
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,175
And you weren't interested?

173
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,176
But then I was
completely absorbed

174
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,775
Einstein with the things he had
to say to make him mad at me.

175
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,175
But then?

176
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,275
We all know what happened next.

177
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,467
Doctor Yura, his
time in Europe, her.

178
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,975
You seem to have met many
physicists from other countries.

179
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,175
Yes, it's true.

180
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:06,300
A little Russian?

181
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Not in this matter of reason.

182
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,475
If you'll allow me to continue
my remarks... Stay here.

183
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,867
You will have many
opportunities to cross-select.

184
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,175
After enrolling, I moved to Leiden and
Halbens, where I met for the first time

185
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,700
OK?

186
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:31,300
Hi Yang.

187
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,175
Lecture on new physics.

188
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,275
I need to hear this.

189
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,175
I am an American.

190
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,300
What a surprise.

191
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,350
Let me know if you
need help with English.

192
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,300
What's written?

193
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:06,307
No thank you.

194
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,175
The road to Zurich is long.

195
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,176
Here we take each volume.

196
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:14,175
We will lose you
among the sea cushions.

197
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,275
I am one of them.

198
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
I am a knight.

199
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,225
I followed your
lesson on molecules.

200
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,175
I have received some.

201
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,175
We have some
novelties to choose from.

202
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,300
How do you know?

203
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,175
I thought I'd find out too.

204
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,375
But I came here
around this time.

205
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,220
Learned enough
Dutch in six weeks.

206
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,175
to take a course in
quantum mechanics.

207
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,325
I had to challenge myself.

208
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,251
Quantum physics
wasn't hard enough.

209
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,175
Exhibitionism.

210
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,175
Dutch in six weeks, but
you haven't learned it yet.

211
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,175
I'm not just saying it, it's
on my side of the park.

212
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,175
Shit.

213
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,175
You're homesick, or you know it.

214
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,300
If you feel that not everyone
is welcome, it's just...

215
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,295
They are all Jews.

216
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,300
Eat

217
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:05,175
This is the German you
should be looking for.

218
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,175
Hasbro.

219
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,700
Correct.

220
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:19,307
can lead to the
following hypothesis:

221
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,175
The quantum world
still hides the real world.

222
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,175
Causality is valid, but these
speculations seem to us wholly fruitless.

223
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,175
Okay thanks.

224
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,176
Good day

225
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:38,175
What do you think?

226
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,175
Doctor Oliver.

227
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,175
OMG

228
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,176
Yes.

229
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,175
I like your paper
and your molecules.

230
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,175
Probably because
you are inspired.

231
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,175
Let me know if I inspire
you with anything else.

232
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,175
We can publish together.

233
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,175
I have to go back to America.

234
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
Why?

235
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,175
Nobody takes quantum
mechanics seriously.

236
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,700
Here because.

237
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,300
He misses the Latin canyons.

238
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,175
The canyons of New Mexico.

239
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,175
Are you from New Mexico?

240
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,176
No, from New York.

241
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:04,300
But my brother and I have
a ranch outside of Santa Fe.

242
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,175
This is the America
I miss right now.

243
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,175
Then you better go home, cowboy.

244
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,175
Haha.

245
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,300
Here we are.

246
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,175
No, me and the horses.

247
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,176
I do not think so.

248
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:16,300
Nice to meet you.

249
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,325
Have you ever met
Harrison Burke?

250
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,850
Not separated

251
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,475
No, but it can be said that
our paths have crossed.

252
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,175
I go back to America.

253
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,300
There I accepted positions at
both Caltech and David Burke.

254
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:51,257
Dr. Lawrence, I assume?

255
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,175
You must have left
while I was working.

256
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,176
Yes.

257
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:06,595
I heard you want to open
a school of quantum theory.

258
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,175
I'll start next door.

259
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,300
They put you there.

260
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,175
I thought I was closer
to you experimenters.

261
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,567
Theory can only take you so far.

262
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,175
We are building a machine
to accelerate electrons.

263
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,176
Magnificent.

264
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:19,175
Do you want to help me?

265
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Build?  Negative

266
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,175
Haha.

267
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,176
NO

268
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:24,275
But I'm working on theories
that I want to test with him.

269
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,175
When do you start teaching?

270
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,175
I'll have the first one in an hour.

271
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,175
A seminar?

272
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,176
Student.

273
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:31,175
A student

274
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,176
That's all?

275
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,175
I teach something that
no one is trapped in here.

276
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,767
But when people start hearing about
what can be done, they keep coming back.

277
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,300
I... Mr. Lomont?

278
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,176
NO.

279
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:48,175
Yes.

280
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,175
That's all

281
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,175
Please.

282
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,700
Sitting

283
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,300
What do you know about
quantum mechanics?

284
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,176
I have an overview based on

285
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:02,300
And you are doing it wrong.

286
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,175
Is light composed
of particles or waves?

287
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,175
The focus is on
quantum mechanics.

288
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,176
How can it be both?

289
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:11,175
AK But it is.

290
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,176
Paradoxical

291
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,175
And it still works.

292
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:21,307
Fine thanks.

293
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,175
Mr. Lomont, you'll be fine.

294
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,175
Mr. Snyder.

295
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,300
Now let's think about a star.

296
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,175
A star in a giant
fiery furnace in space.

297
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,175
Fire pushes up
against its own gravity.

298
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,175
Balanced

299
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:46,175
But if this sentence stacks
up, gravity starts to win.

300
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,176
Bargain

301
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:49,175
Density increases.

302
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,175
Correct.

303
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,176
Increased gravity.

304
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:53,175
Increased intensity.

305
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,175
And it's a vicious cycle,
until... What's the limit?

306
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,175
I do not know

307
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,441
You see, when math guides us,

308
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:02,175
I guarantee you it's a place
no one has ever been before.

309
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,700
AND?

310
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,175
Yes, you and your calculations
are better than mine.

311
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:13,175
Dr. Abenheimer provided
details and activities at Berkeley.

312
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,175
Why did he file it before
Dr. War Abenheimer?

313
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,300
You'll have to ask Mr. Hoover.

314
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,175
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

315
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,513
Well, I think he was addicted.

316
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:30,175
leftist political activities.

317
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,175
You shouldn't have had your
politics written in class, Bobby.

318
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,300
I wrote

319
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,275
Lawrence, you have
revolutionized physics.

320
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,300
Do you see it elsewhere too?

321
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,175
Picasso, Stravinsky, Froy,
Marx... This is America.

322
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
We made our revolution.

323
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,175
Really.

324
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,225
Stay away from the lab.

325
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,175
My lab roommate is
discussing tonight's dinner.

326
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,176
Interesting.

327
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:58,225
I did some research on
Berkeley's political climate.

328
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,991
All just the philosophy
graduate students

329
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,725
and communists who
talked about integration.

330
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,175
You are not interested
in integration.

331
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,175
I don't want to talk
about it, I want to vote.

332
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,175
Especially Friday.

333
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,700
Come on, let's eat.

334
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,604
I have to meet my brother there.

335
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,300
And how do these activities run
counter to the purpose of the FBI?

336
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,300
If I remember correctly,

337
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,225
The FBI was taking the plates.

338
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,225
number of meetings of suspected
communists on the island.

339
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,300
Name removed

340
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,175
For the love of God

341
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,300
I am sorry

342
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,175
Honestly, but...
I remember Jackie.

343
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,700
Good night

344
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:47,175
Robert, I want you to meet John.

345
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,175
Hopin Stavallier,
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

346
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,176
Pleasure

347
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:53,175
This is my little brother Frank.

348
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,175
And this... Always Jackie.

349
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,300
Hello again to Jackie.

350
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,175
Stavallier, you speak in tongues
and your reputation recognizes you.

351
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
what you heard

352
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,245
I'm glad you taught me a
new approach to physics.

353
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,175
I do not have the ability to
understand, but I did not hear.

354
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,175
You are a party
member, but I am not.

355
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300
Not yet

356
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,425
Frank and I agree.

357
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,175
I support a number of policies.

358
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,176
It was a civil war

359
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:14,890
Democratic republic overthrown

360
00:21:15,015 --> 00:21:17,275
by fascist thugs who don't.

361
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,275
Government

362
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,245
They think the greatest threat
to their fascists is socialism.

363
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,176
Not for long.

364
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:24,175
Many other Nazis
come from the Jews.

365
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,575
I send money to my colleagues in Germany
so they have a bigger eye to do something.

366
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,275
My old work is very abstract.

367
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,175
What are you working on?

368
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,425
What happens to
stars when they die?

369
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,300
Do the stars die?

370
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,300
If they do, they cool
down and collapse.

371
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,175
In fact, the more massive the star,
the more severe the extinction will be.

372
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,175
Their weight becomes so
dense that they engulf everything.

373
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,175
Anything you might like.

374
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,775
Can it really happen?

375
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,345
The math says it can happen.

376
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,175
If we publish it, maybe one
day an astronomer will find it.

377
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,325
but at the moment i only have one
theory that it can't affect people's life.

378
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,996
Well if you are sending money

379
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:06,175
Spain, do it through
the Communist Party.

380
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,425
They can take him to the front.

381
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,300
Sorry, I said you
were happy, I'm Jane.

382
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,275
Robert.

383
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,300
Conchobelia, you and I
were on duty last month.

384
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,300
Right, right, yeah.
Well thank you.

385
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,675
Robert claims he
is not a communist.

386
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,175
But he doesn't know enough.

387
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,300
His Wife covers all
three volumes.  Count

388
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,375
He'd make you read the bloodiest
members church or something.

389
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,175
Thinker.  The property is theft.

390
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,175
Property.

391
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,700
Property?

392
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,176
Goods, not pollution.

393
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:40,035
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I read
it in the original German.

394
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,450
It's not about the book.
It's about ideas.

395
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,300
And you speak objectively.

396
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,425
I dedicate myself to thinking freely
about how to improve our world.

397
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,245
Why limit yourself to a dogma?

398
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,300
You are a physicist.
You choose the rules.

399
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,795
Or do you use discipline to direct
your energy towards progress?

400
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,300
I clean with the room.

401
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,300
You always speak
along the party line.

402
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,767
I also like my room to
be on the same level.

403
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:17,307
What?

404
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

405
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,300
I've been waiting... What is it?

406
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,176
For a physicist.

407
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:33,300
You have a shelf full of Freuds.

408
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:38,300
Well, I actually have more...
Young Ian?

409
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,300
Know the analytics.

410
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,150
I had some trouble in Cambridge.

411
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,350
And you?

412
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,175
I tried to poison my teacher.

413
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,175
Did you hate him?

414
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
I really like.

415
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,300
You just have to lie down.

416
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,526
It took my analyst two
years, and I don't think that

417
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:56,175
I wonder if they have ever
expressed it so succinctly.

418
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,775
Everyone has convinced you that you
are more complex than you really are.

419
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,325
I believe you are
all simple souls.

420
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,300
Reading

421
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,175
What is this?

422
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
Sand cream

423
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,175
You can read this

424
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,300
Reading

425
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,300
Read this

426
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:25,300
This is where the fish leave the
low arm system.  Do you know that

427
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,300
Read the words

428
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,300
And now I'm dead.

429
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:41,300
Worlds destroyed.

430
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,175
That's all.

431
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:21,175
A little break before dawn.

432
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,175
It will get colder
during the night.

433
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,176
Just before dawn.

434
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:26,175
No break

435
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:33,307
So I will get married.

436
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,175
Frank, congratulations.

437
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,300
Thanks Jackie

438
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,175
Yes, for Jackie.

439
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,175
Garlic

440
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,225
I will be your rightful owner.

441
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,350
He relaxes

442
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,334
I will see him
talk to the stars.

443
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,175
All your talk about
the common man.

444
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,325
Jackie is not enough for you.

445
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,175
We join the party and you can
no longer hide your discipline.

446
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,175
Why?

447
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,176
Why is it worth it?

448
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:01,175
I didn't sign up
for a party, Frank.

449
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,175
And I don't think he had
to convince you of that.

450
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,175
Half the faculty is gone.

451
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Yes, it's half.

452
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,175
I'm your brother, Frank,
and I want you to be careful.

453
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,300
And I want to steal your neck.

454
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,300
I will not live my life with
the fear of making mistakes.

455
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,550
You are happy

456
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,275
I am happy

457
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,400
I'm glad you're
happy that I'm happy.

458
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:32,807
When you look, I see one of the
dark stars you've been working on.

459
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,176
You can not

460
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:38,175
It is the entire center of
gravity that absorbs light.

461
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,175
It's like some kind
of hole in space.

462
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,275
Is Frank okay?

463
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,225
Yes.

464
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,300
He's just a fucking
brother talking.

465
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,407
When I was little, I
thought if I could find a way

466
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,875
combine physics and New Mexico,
my life would have been perfect.

467
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,175
Is it a bit far for that?

468
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,225
Yes.

469
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,300
Let's sleep a bit.

470
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,176
Today we saw New Mexico.

471
00:27:11,301 --> 00:27:14,300
One of my favorite
places in the world.

472
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,300
Tomorrow's weather

473
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,175
What is his name?

474
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,300
Poplars

475
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,300
I didn't expect
to see you today.

476
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,350
I'll have to make
an appointment.

477
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,175
Robert

478
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:41,307
Tommy!

479
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,175
What?

480
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,176
What is that?

481
00:27:44,301 --> 00:27:47,175
They did it.

482
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,300
They disintegrated
the uranium core.

483
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,175
WELL?

484
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,175
I'm worried about neutrons.

485
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,175
It's nuclear fission.

486
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,175
They did it.

487
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,176
They split the atom

488
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,175
Stop my skull

489
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:07,307
I will try to reproduce it.

490
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:15,300
Can you see it?

491
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,300
It can not be done.

492
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,175
Very stylish.

493
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,176
Very clear

494
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:22,175
There is only one problem.

495
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,300
Where is it?

496
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,225
Another door.

497
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,300
Alvarez did it

498
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,500
You see

499
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,300
These fission pulses are huge.

500
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,300
I've seen 30 in
the last 10 minutes.

501
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,300
Theory can only take you so far.

502
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,175
During the process an
external transport office

503
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,425
can be used to transfer
more uranium atoms.

504
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,300
Chain reaction

505
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,175
You are thinking what I think.

506
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,176
You're strange

507
00:28:52,301 --> 00:28:55,300
Every other physicist in
the world has seen you.

508
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,225
Are you wondering
what we are all thinking?

509
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,300
Bomba, Alvarez.

510
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,275
Bomb

511
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,300
I told you Rob, no
more bullshit flowers.

512
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,176
I do not understand what you want.

513
00:29:10,301 --> 00:29:13,300
I don't want anything from you.

514
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,325
But you say it and then you call.

515
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,300
Do not answer

516
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,175
I always answer

517
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,175
Naturally.

518
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,300
Only there are no more flowers.

519
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,175
They are arriving

520
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,175
You need to know when
you're defeated, Robert.

521
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,275
It's not that simple, okay?

522
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,175
Barlier, it's good to see you.

523
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,300
We don't have
Barbara, nice to see you.

524
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,300
And the famous Dr. Rottenheimer.

525
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,175
Like Alton Tippett.

526
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,176
NO

527
00:29:42,301 --> 00:29:44,175
What's wrong with
me, please, please?

528
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,175
May I say a few words
about organized work?

529
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,175
It's passing, it's passing.

530
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,176
I work at Shell.

531
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:53,175
We turn to chemists
and engineers.

532
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,300
There is science
in this position.

533
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,175
Teachers are unionized.
Why?  Professors.

534
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,176
Don't have a place to stay?

535
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:20,275
Lawrence, also legal academics.

536
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,175
Look, it's not that.

537
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,176
A group is coming.

538
00:30:22,301 --> 00:30:24,175
Let's go in.

539
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,300
Not this one

540
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:35,557
That's all.  Dr. Bush.
What brought you north?

541
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:47,457
Richard, tell Ruth I'll show
you around on Thursday.

542
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:58,907
April black holes, here it is!

543
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,175
Where's Harvard?

544
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,175
Take Harvard.

545
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,300
September 1, 1939.
The world removes this thing.

546
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,175
Harlan, our newspaper
goes to press.

547
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,300
You were at the top of the leaderboard.

548
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:22,175
I lost more and more sympathy
during the Battle of Britain.

549
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,175
with a policy of neutrality
supported by the Communists.

550
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,175
Hitler invaded Russia
and we became allies.

551
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,175
Will these communists
simply organize their return?

552
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,700
NO

553
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,300
I should clarify that my
changed views on Russia

554
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,525
it did not imply a clean break with
those who held different opinions.

555
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,175
For a year or two during
my previous marriage, my

556
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,300
wife Kitty was a member
of the Communist Party.

557
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,225
It is true.  It's a good thing.

558
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,175
I love it, Mr. Paulman.

559
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,275
I live with them,
I'm from the port.

560
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,175
do you believe in something?

561
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,701
Look at Ruthie.

562
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,300
So you are a biologist.

563
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,534
Somehow I graduated
to be a housewife.

564
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,175
Can you explain
quantum mechanics to me?

565
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,700
It looks bad

566
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,500
Yes it is.

567
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,175
Well, it's glass.

568
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,225
It's a drink.

569
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,300
This is a work plan.

570
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,600
Our bodies

571
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,100
Everything

572
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,645
Mostly empty space.

573
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,175
Clusters of small
interconnected energy waves.

574
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,176
What is that?

575
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:37,300
Attractive forces strong
enough to convince us.

576
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,176
it is solid.

577
00:32:39,301 --> 00:32:42,300
It's not my body
passing through yours.

578
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:50,707
You are married to Dr. Harrison.

579
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
I'm not married

580
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,175
There's someone I feel...
That's how they feel.

581
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,300
Sometimes I don't know.

582
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,300
You know, going to New Mexico,

583
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,501
you should come to
my farm with my friends.

584
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,175
I met your husband

585
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,700
Yes, you have met him

586
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,951
Because you know there
won't be a better difference.

587
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,175
Why did you marry him?

588
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,300
I'm lost

589
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,175
He was a good person.

590
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,300
You lost?

591
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,300
Your previous husband is dead.

592
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,175
At 28 she was not yet
ready to become a widow.

593
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,175
Who is your first husband?

594
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,176
Nobody

595
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:46,435
My second husband
was Joe Dallad.

596
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,300
he was full of money, like me.

597
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,675
but he was a union
organization in Youngstown, Ohio.

598
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,175
What a difficulty.

599
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,300
How hard is that?

600
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,175
The next four years are going to be tough
enough to live on beans and pancakes.

601
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,300
They were returning the
Daily Worker to Regatta.

602
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,175
At 36, I told Joe I
couldn't take it anymore.

603
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,176
Leave the party

604
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:07,175
Then you want it back.

605
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,175
He is not a day laborer.

606
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,175
He sleeps well and will
meet you on my trip to Spain.

607
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,175
I'm going to a lawless country

608
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,175
Then he went to
Regatta and I waited.

609
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,300
TO...

610
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,275
Joe killed himself the first time
he pulled his head out of the ditch.

611
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,275
My ideology killed Joe.

612
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,176
For nothing.

613
00:34:24,301 --> 00:34:26,175
What kind of republic
is this?  Nothing?

614
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,075
My husband offered
to come both to avoid it.

615
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,225
so that a fascist bullet
stuck in the mudbag.

616
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,300
This is the
definition of nothing.

617
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,175
It seems a bit reductive to me.

618
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,175
Magnetic

619
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,175
Now I'm here

620
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,300
Who the hell is that?

621
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,567
I didn't hear anyone
else in either unit.

622
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,300
At least you didn't
bring me flowers.

623
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:08,607
Two in one, that's not
what you want, Jane.

624
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,300
Yes, but the door is closing.

625
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,300
NO

626
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,300
As far as I'm concerned, no.

627
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
You knocked him
down.  Don't work too fast.

628
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,175
I can't hold a good man.

629
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,300
Yes.

630
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,175
I need him.

631
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,175
He knew what he wanted.

632
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,175
And the husband?

633
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,500
We were talking.
They are divorcing.

634
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,575
So we can get married
before it starts manifesting.

635
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,300
I would have asked.

636
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,945
Idiot.  This is your community.

637
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,275
Think the rules don't
apply to the Golden Child?

638
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,575
Bright strokes abounded.

639
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,167
Don't alienate the only people in the
world who understand what you're doing.

640
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,525
You may need them someday.

641
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,175
FAED

642
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:03,300
Federation Dext Department.
Engineers, chemists, technicians.

643
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:10,757
brightness.

644
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,175
How much do you get per month?

645
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,176
The point is nothing.

646
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:16,025
What does all this have
to do with agriculture?

647
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,175
workers and longshoremen?

648
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Too

649
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,175
All out?

650
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,700
NO!

651
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,300
Is not you

652
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:35,457
What are you doing?

653
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,176
This is a union.

654
00:36:37,301 --> 00:36:40,175
FAED We have been
dealing with this for a long time.

655
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,225
I would like to try to forgive you.

656
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:45,017
They won't let me take you to the
project because of this nonsense.

657
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,175
They won't even let me
say what the project is.

658
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,175
I know what the project is.

659
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300
Really?

660
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,285
We've all heard of Einstein
and Sitter's letter to Roosevelt.

661
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,225
He warned him that the
Germans might build a bomb.

662
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,175
And I know what it meant
for the Nazis to have a union.

663
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,700
But not me?

664
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,175
I'm not your people.
They vandalized the field.

665
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,700
this is me

666
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,701
You think I'm telling
them about your politics.

667
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,075
When you come
home from a meeting,

668
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,400
Do not look in the
rear view mirror

669
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,897
don't listen to the
voices on the phone

670
00:37:16,022 --> 00:37:18,823
get in line and
stop being so naive.

671
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,867
I really care about what I do.

672
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,367
Because you're not just pretentious.
You are really important.

673
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,920
Certain.

674
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,045
And if you can be
a little pragmatic..,

675
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,325
I'll talk to lenders,
I'll talk to others.

676
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,175
You do not have to worry.
It's all right.

677
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,700
Alliance.

678
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:46,175
Then comes the war.

679
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,225
I filled out my first safety
questionnaire and was good to go.

680
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,175
I have reportedly
joined leftist groups

681
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,300
my work on the atomic
program will not lie.

682
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,390
Why wasn't this done during
the communist associations?

683
00:37:59,515 --> 00:38:02,300
were wars seen as
a security bailout?

684
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,825
Senator, I can't
answer due to security.

685
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,445
I looked into Grant's background
years before I met him.

686
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,300
What's up?
And what will happen now?

687
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,455
After the war,
Dr. Oppenheimer was one of the

688
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,300
most respected scientific
voices in the world.

689
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,625
That's why I asked
him to join the Institute.

690
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,175
He was then a consultant to
the Atomic Energy Commission.

691
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,176
And who is he?

692
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:23,300
They really blame me for this.

693
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,945
I think they just want to know what
happened between 1947 and 1947.

694
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:30,445
1954, to change his mind about
Oppenheimer's authorization.

695
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,955
I wasn't.  I was president
of the AEC, but he was not.

696
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,175
I'm the one who made the
accusations against Robert.

697
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,225
Who did it?

698
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,625
I am a former employee
of the United Congress.

699
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,175
Advise.  Here is the rabid
anti-communist Borton.

700
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,175
He wrote to the FBI
and asked to intervene.

701
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,225
The FBI doesn't
go to the AEC, Rick.

702
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:51,175
And you get a
knife in your hand.

703
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
Did Borton have a son?

704
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,300
It was the McCarthy era.

705
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,175
People lost their
jobs because of him,

706
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,875
He was caught reading
Oppenheimer's security file.

707
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,645
brother, sister and girlfriend,
best friend, minister's wife.

708
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:09,175
Even before boarding
the AEC institute.

709
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,175
How does Borton get access
to Oppenheimer's security file?

710
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,175
Because someone gave it to him.

711
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,175
Someone would also have
observed Robert's silence.

712
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,300
WEAVING?

713
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,099
Who knows.  Robert was
careful not to get angry.

714
00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:24,525
Power brokers in Washington.

715
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:27,325
His views on the atom
have been defined.

716
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:31,184
And he always lacked
patience with us mortals.

717
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,175
I have been subjected
to many cruel treatments.

718
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:41,175
The AEC votes on the
export of isotopes to Norway.

719
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,475
And they designed it to
make me look stupid, Robert.

720
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,215
But, Dr. Oppenheimer, we learned
from Admiral Stross what happened.

721
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,175
Isotopes could be useful to our
enemies for building atomic weapons.

722
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,175
Countess Menyuk used the Space
Shuttle to build atomic weapons.

723
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,176
And what have you done?

724
00:39:56,301 --> 00:39:59,175
You can use a bottle of beer
to create atomic weapons.

725
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,176
You actually did.

726
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:03,405
I'd say the isotopes are
less useful than the electronic

727
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,300
ones in weapons, but
more useful than a sandwich.

728
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:12,300
Genius is no
guarantee of wisdom.

729
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,634
Look at this man
who sees me so blind.

730
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,700
kittens?

731
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,700
kittens?

732
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,175
kittens?

733
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,700
Received.

734
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,700
I'm there

735
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,175
I am in

736
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,700
Let's celebrate

737
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,300
Don't you have to go?

738
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,300
I've been looking
for it all day.

739
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,300
I do not know how to say it.

740
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,300
I'm embarrassed to ask.

741
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,175
Something?

742
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,175
Marry Peter.

743
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,700
Naturally.

744
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,175
I've known him for a while, Hulk.

745
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,700
An.

746
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,176
Does the kitty know you?

747
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:41,300
Yes, of course he knows you.

748
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,550
Of course he knows.

749
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,400
We are terrible people.

750
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,175
Selfish and terrible people.

751
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,300
He forgets I asked you.

752
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,300
Selfish and terrible people.

753
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,300
They do not know

754
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,176
They are selfish and awful.

755
00:41:55,301 --> 00:41:58,295
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

756
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:04,175
Robert, you see beyond
the world we live in.

757
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,300
This has to be paid for.

758
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,650
Of course we will help you.

759
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,175
Everything changes, Robert.

760
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,225
Boy Harry has always changed.

761
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:27,300
The world is turning
in a new direction.

762
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,300
reform the world

763
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,300
This is your moment.

764
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,175
We are forming a working group.

765
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,275
We have to do everything.

766
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,800
You have to.

767
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,417
Lawrence can't do it.

768
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,684
We were told, “Monor
Ravi, you will make it”.

769
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,300
Who are the unicorns?

770
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,300
I thought you might have them.

771
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:03,275
Roger, Robert, this
is Colonel Brooks.

772
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,334
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Nichols.

773
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,300
Get a drag link.

774
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,300
That's how you treat
a lieutenant colonel.

775
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,175
I have come to see how the
humble are treated, this is his son.

776
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,175
I'll let you know if I
meet him one day.

777
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,176
How much?

778
00:43:22,301 --> 00:43:24,301
Theaters of war
around the world.

779
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,175
But I have to stay
in Washington.

780
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,175
Why?

781
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,300
I built the Pentagon.

782
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:33,175
Nebraska liked it so much that they let me take
over the engineering district in Manhattan.

783
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,175
Which?

784
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,175
Whatever it is

785
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,700
The biggest smartass.

786
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,176
You know very well what it is.

787
00:43:38,301 --> 00:43:40,275
You and half the physics
departments in the country.

788
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,300
This is problem number one.

789
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,175
I thought the number one problem
was finding enough uranium ore.

790
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,245
1200 tons

791
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,175
I bought it the
same day I bought it.

792
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,300
Is it processed?

793
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,300
Work begins in Oak
Ridge, Tennessee.

794
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,175
I am looking for a
project manager.

795
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,700
And my name came up.

796
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,350
NO

797
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:03,145
Even if it brought quantum physics
to America, which gave me pause.

798
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,670
What did you discover?

799
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,275
You are a dilettante, a womanizer
and a suspected communist.

800
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,175
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

801
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,767
I said suspicious

802
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,225
Unstable, theatrical,
selfish, neurotic.

803
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,175
There is no good.

804
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,176
No, he's not even a genius.

805
00:44:18,301 --> 00:44:21,175
In your environment, on the other
hand, brilliance is taken for granted.

806
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,300
then no

807
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,867
The only person who had
anything to say was Richard Tolman.

808
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,275
Tolman thinks
you're being honest.

809
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,734
But he also seems to me a person who
knows more about science than people.

810
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,900
And here you are.

811
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:36,176
You don't need a lot of trust.

812
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:38,300
I take nothing for granted.

813
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,175
Why don't you
have a Nobel Prize?

814
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,175
Why aren't you a general?

815
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,175
That's what they made me for.

816
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,176
Maybe I'll have the same chance.

817
00:44:47,301 --> 00:44:49,175
Nobel prize for
building the bomb?

818
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,634
Add the Nobel
prize for dynamite.

819
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,367
And how to proceed?

820
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:00,215
You're talking about
turning theory into a

821
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,275
practical weapons system
faster than the Nazis.

822
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,175
We have a 12 month head start.

823
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,175
18.

824
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,176
How do you know?

825
00:45:08,301 --> 00:45:10,175
Our search for fast
neutrons lasted six months.

826
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,175
A man who was doubted would
make an immediate discovery.

827
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,175
Who do you think
they put in charge?

828
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,300
Bernard Heisenberg

829
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,175
The most intuitive understanding
of atomic structure he's ever seen.

830
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,176
Know your job.

831
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,175
I know him as well as Walter.

832
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,225
Both Isaac and Diebner, we
Germans win his direct competition.

833
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:30,300
We have only one hope
and that is... anti-Semitism.

834
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,577
What Hitler called
quantum physics

835
00:45:34,702 --> 00:45:37,175
Jewish science is the
opposite of Einstein, we

836
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,535
can only hope that Hitler
was so blinded by hatred

837
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,325
Heisenberg's denial
of his own sources,

838
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,925
because it will require
enormous resources.

839
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,225
The best scientists in our
country are currently working

840
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:49,725
together, they are disorganized,
which gives us space.

841
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:52,175
To contribute effectively, all
brains must see the task as a whole.

842
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,300
Poor safety can make
us inefficient at running.

843
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,900
The Germans know
more than we do.

844
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:00,550
The Russians don't.

845
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,175
You remind me
who we're fighting?

846
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,855
Someone with your background doesn't
want to be seen as underestimating them.

847
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,175
the importance of the
security of our communist allies.

848
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,300
We understand it, but
we don't understand it.

849
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,300
You can't tell me no.

850
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,617
My job is to tell you
no, and you're wrong.

851
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,225
So do you already have a job?

852
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,300
Think

853
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,021
I'm starting to understand
where his fame comes from.

854
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:34,504
My favorite answer is that Oppenheimer
couldn't run a hamburger stand.

855
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,650
I couldn't do it

856
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,750
But I can handle the
Manhattan Project.

857
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,425
It's just a way to
balance things out.

858
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:48,175
Establish a proper laboratory
under Lawrence here in Berkeley.

859
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,423
He recognized it
in his Chicago lab.

860
00:46:50,548 --> 00:46:53,175
A large number of search
terms in Tennessee.

861
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,175
in Hanford

862
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:59,365
All America, industrial, mining,
scientific innovation, connected

863
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:03,175
by railroad, to a single point in
space and time, to a single goal.

864
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,175
And here it all comes together.

865
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,175
A secret laboratory in
the middle of nowhere.

866
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,175
A safe and self-sufficient
structure that hosts the works.

867
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,175
Keep everyone there
until the job is done.

868
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,175
They will need a
school, shop or church.

869
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,176
Why?

870
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:18,175
If we don't allow scientists to bring their
families, we will never have the best.

871
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,175
And do you want to
create security in the city?

872
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,175
Build fast.

873
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,700
Where is it?

874
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,175
Welcome to Los Alamos.

875
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,095
There is a boys school
which will have two things in

876
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,175
common and local Indians
can be prepared for burial rights.

877
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,175
But nothing.

878
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,175
40 miles in any direction.

879
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,300
I have to find the
perfect place for success.

880
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,300
Build a city fast.

881
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,175
We hire scientists.

882
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,176
Why do I need my parents?

883
00:47:53,301 --> 00:47:55,175
I told you you can
bring your family.

884
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,176
I'm not a soldier.

885
00:47:56,301 --> 00:47:58,175
I am a soldier

886
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,176
This is a general

887
00:47:59,301 --> 00:48:01,175
I have all the soldiers I need.

888
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,175
What can I say?

889
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,175
How does it look to you?

890
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,175
NO?

891
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,175
They were both bored.

892
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,176
What do these men
have in common?

893
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:08,175
The greatest points of
view on atomic theory.

894
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,176
Understood?

895
00:48:09,301 --> 00:48:12,175
As many as you want

896
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,175
Can you smell my
food in your balls sir?

897
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,175
You know isotopes and explosives
better than anyone in the world.

898
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,175
But you can't tell
us what you did.

899
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:27,175
I don't know if the
Nazis will have them.

900
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,175
Messengers in
Nazi-occupied Copenhagen.

901
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,175
Has Princeton stopped
printing newspapers?

902
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:35,175
Why go to the middle of
nowhere for who knows how long?

903
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,175
For a year, two or three.

904
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,175
Imagine the country.

905
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,175
Give us a minute.

906
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,175
It is about unleashing
a powerful force.

907
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,175
Not before the Nazis.

908
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,175
OMG

909
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,175
The hills don't
work for the Nazis.

910
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,175
Never.

911
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,175
They are owned by them

912
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,176
Not us

913
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:56,175
That's why I need you.

914
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,175
Why do you think
I should do this?

915
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,175
Why?

916
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,155
And if that was the
most important thing

917
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,175
Something that has never
happened in the history of the world?

918
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,176
And this?

919
00:49:05,301 --> 00:49:07,175
I do not think so

920
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:14,300
They won't let me
leave this project.

921
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,685
And I can't get
security clearance,

922
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,175
for a career even after the war.

923
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,175
So you are travel companions.

924
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,176
One of them

925
00:49:22,301 --> 00:49:24,175
This is a national emergency.

926
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,175
I have skeletons.

927
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,300
They entrusted me.

928
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,175
They need us.

929
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,176
Until they do.

930
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:35,175
Is there a chance to
get bored in Denmark?

931
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,195
Yes, no way.

932
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,175
I checked with the British.

933
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,075
There's no other way until we can get
the allied ships back to the continent.

934
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,225
Is it that important?

935
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:49,300
How many people do you
know in real dance time, Paul?

936
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:51,225
It would really be
faster to go by plane.

937
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:53,175
No, the plane is too risky.

938
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,300
The country needs us.

939
00:49:55,450 --> 00:50:00,175
Dad, guys, it's not a building.

940
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,300
That's it for the cyclotron.

941
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,300
Count the architects

942
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:11,225
When is this place
supposed to open?

943
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:15,300
Two months

944
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:22,300
Robin, you're a great improviser,
but this... doesn't work in your head.

945
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:25,175
Four topics

946
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,175
Experimental

947
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,275
Theoretical

948
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,175
Memory diary

949
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,175
Transcending theory.

950
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,176
As?

951
00:50:31,301 --> 00:50:33,300
Here's what I was afraid of.

952
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,417
You smeared it too much.

953
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,300
So in theory, take it.

954
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:43,300
I'm not coming here, Robin.

955
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:50,300
Why?

956
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:01,300
Throw a bomb and it will
fall on the just and the unjust.

957
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,725
I do not wish the
peak of three physical

958
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:07,450
centuries were a weapon
of mass destruction.

959
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:18,300
And he?

960
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:23,300
I don't know if such a
weapon can be trusted.

961
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,300
But I know the
Nazis can't do that.

962
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,300
We have no other choice.

963
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,925
The second thing to do is list

964
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:43,300
Holmes Bethe will head
the theoretical department.

965
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:49,175
Ray, first things first... Take
off that ridiculous uniform.

966
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,176
You are a scientist.

967
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:52,175
Groves insists we unite.

968
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,175
Tell Groves to go fuck his hat.

969
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,300
They need us as we are.

970
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,400
Then be yourself.

971
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,300
It's better.

972
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,175
This is the only key.

973
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,175
The cashiers are already here.

974
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,176
I can show you?

975
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:46,175
No, let's wait for the others.

976
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:53,307
let's begin

977
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,175
Device.

978
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,300
Yes Madam.

979
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:04,175
So we'll be working here until the
Los Alamos T section is finished.

980
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,176
Edward, can I?

981
00:53:05,301 --> 00:53:07,300
This is more important.

982
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,645
Can I calculate
the chain reaction?

983
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,304
I find this possibility
quite disturbing.

984
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,175
No, but it can't be a lie.

985
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,175
Show me how you
created your population.

986
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,300
Yes.

987
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,176
It's a fantasy.

988
00:53:31,301 --> 00:53:33,835
The teller's calculations
cannot be corrected.

989
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,175
Do you know what I
have in Princeton, sir?

990
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,175
What is it for?

991
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,300
I talked to Einstein.

992
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:41,137
There are not many
comments on the truth.

993
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:43,750
That's why I need to
know his point of view.

994
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,400
Albert.

995
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,295
No, Dr. Albert Heidman.

996
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,175
How did you meet Dr. Gert?

997
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,175
We come here almost every day.

998
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:00,300
Things are the most
inspiring structures.

999
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,300
Albert, I have to tell you something.

1000
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,176
Of course not.

1001
00:54:04,301 --> 00:54:06,300
I was just reading.

1002
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,300
Some days she refuses to read.

1003
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,434
Even in Princeton he believes
that the Nazis can poison his food.

1004
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:28,225
Whose world is this?

1005
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,300
scrutineer

1006
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:33,175
What does it mean?

1007
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,175
Vchod, broken
heart, püstüte mum.

1008
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,175
Entry, entry into other nuclei.

1009
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,175
What can criticality do, a great
irreversible explosive power?

1010
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,175
Stopping time of
a chain reaction.

1011
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:50,175
It would set the atmosphere on fire.

1012
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,315
If we blow up the atomic
device, we can launch

1013
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,175
a chain reaction that
could destroy the world.

1014
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,175
So are we here?

1015
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:06,225
Lost in a quantum world made
of probabilities and certainties.

1016
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,175
Can you do the calculations yourself?

1017
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,300
NO

1018
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:14,175
The only thing you and I have in
common is that we despise math.

1019
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,175
Who is working on
this project in Berkeley?

1020
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:17,176
Hans Beidman

1021
00:55:17,301 --> 00:55:21,175
All right, you'll find the truth.

1022
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,175
What if it was a real disaster?

1023
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:29,175
Then you stop and share
your findings with the Nazis.

1024
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:35,225
So neither side is
destroying the world.

1025
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:37,300
Albert,

1026
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,300
this is yours, not mine.

1027
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:47,557
house cashier,

1028
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,300
He is at home

1029
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:10,295
Now that you've told us the critical
assumptions, a picture emerges.

1030
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,300
Scheme

1031
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,275
The probability is not there until
the nuclear reaction approaches zero.

1032
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,300
Nearly zero?

1033
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,175
This is good news.

1034
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,025
Can you make them work again?

1035
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,875
No, you will get
the same answer.

1036
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,555
Until you fire one
of these, that's

1037
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,275
the best guarantee
you'll ever get.

1038
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,300
Almost zero.

1039
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:36,175
Space can only take you so far.

1040
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,175
HI.

1041
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,175
We miss

1042
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,175
You want to adopt a child

1043
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,175
He's kidding

1044
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,300
We wanted to see you.

1045
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,900
What have we left

1046
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:47,300
For the unknown parties.

1047
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,725
Do you know who I
met the other day?

1048
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,175
Eltonton.

1049
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,300
Michelle McAllister

1050
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,175
Are you a new man?

1051
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,300
Yes, a FAZIO man.

1052
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,517
He complained about
our handling of the war.

1053
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:06,300
Plus the lack of
cooperation with our allies.

1054
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:11,300
The government does not appear to be
sharing any research with the Russians.

1055
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:15,175
He said most scientists
think politics is stupid.

1056
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:20,300
Yes.

1057
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:25,300
If someone has something
he wants to pass on,

1058
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:30,300
he bypassed the official
channels where he could be of help.

1059
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:40,300
He will lead to self-production.

1060
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:42,300
Yes, certainly.

1061
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:45,451
I thought you should know.

1062
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,275
Bra underneath

1063
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,300
We are drinking martinis.

1064
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:56,417
We arrive directly.

1065
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,176
There he struck
up a conversation.

1066
00:57:58,301 --> 00:58:02,075
Nothing in our long friendship
would make me believe that.

1067
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,800
Chevelia was actually
looking for information.

1068
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:09,450
and I'm sure he had no
idea what I was doing.

1069
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:18,175
It had already been clear to me for some time
that I should report the incident immediately.

1070
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:23,175
Oppenheimer's case highlights
the tension between scientists

1071
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,175
and hopes of learning how
to make a safety device.

1072
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,175
the candidate dealt with these
issues during his tenure at ABC.

1073
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:33,175
A scientist will appear
before the commission.

1074
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,175
They are carrying them.

1075
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,300
Didn't they tell you?

1076
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:39,175
Mr. President, if I may, I have been nominated
for the position of Commercial Secretary.

1077
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,275
Why?

1078
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,300
Ask scientists
for their opinion.

1079
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:44,176
The toilet is a column table.

1080
00:58:44,301 --> 00:58:47,175
We're looking for a
broad range of opinions.

1081
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,325
I would like to know the names
of the scientists who testified.

1082
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,995
I want to be able
to cross search.

1083
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,175
This is not a process.

1084
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,176
Formality?

1085
00:58:55,301 --> 00:58:56,948
Unconfirmed since 1925 no

1086
00:58:57,073 --> 00:58:59,345
presidential cabinet
appointments.

1087
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:01,275
Here's how to play.

1088
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,300
In your pocket, Lewis.
Then play well.

1089
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,850
Are they bringing scientists?

1090
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:09,075
You don't know scientists
like me, counselor.

1091
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,175
Everyone is annoyed by judgmental
questions, especially everyone.

1092
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,300
I was president of ABC.

1093
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:16,175
I can easily be blamed
for things going wrong.

1094
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,175
But we cannot allow the Senate to
take over the scientific community.

1095
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,175
He doesn't support you, sir.

1096
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,175
Or should we?

1097
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,300
What happened?

1098
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:25,300
invasive

1099
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,176
I fought Oppenheimer
in the United States.

1100
00:59:27,301 --> 00:59:29,295
I don't think it's
time to talk about it.

1101
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:31,175
Is there anyone we can call
to find out what happened?

1102
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,175
Tell him

1103
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,176
They will make a
good impression.

1104
00:59:33,301 --> 00:59:35,175
Can you find out the names of
the scientists they are looking for?

1105
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,176
Most likely

1106
00:59:36,301 --> 00:59:39,175
Find out if he lived in Chicago
or Los Alamos during the war.

1107
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,176
Who cares?

1108
00:59:40,301 --> 00:59:42,265
If he lived in Chicago, they
too worked on their own.

1109
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:44,175
silver to confirm that
there is no obvious cult.

1110
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,700
Poplars

1111
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,645
Robert built this place.  He
was the founder of the Air Sheriff.

1112
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:51,300
He honored him with a.

1113
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,300
This means a greeting.

1114
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:37,175
no kitchen

1115
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,300
Billy

1116
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,300
What was it?

1117
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,175
Barbed wire

1118
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,176
Weapons

1119
01:00:49,301 --> 01:00:51,175
Naturally.

1120
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:55,175
Burnt war, Hans.

1121
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,176
Halifax

1122
01:00:56,301 --> 01:00:58,175
1917.

1123
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,367
Carver's ship carrying
ammunition explodes in the harbor.

1124
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,300
A large and sudden
chemical reaction.

1125
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:13,300
The largest man-made
explosion in history.

1126
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:16,115
Now let's calculate how
much more destructive it will be.

1127
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,440
it was a nuclear reaction,
not a chemical reaction.

1128
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,175
Express the force
in tons of TNT.

1129
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,300
But it would be Salsas.

1130
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:27,300
Then kill all shades.

1131
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:38,175
Using U-235, the bomb
will need... I'm sorry

1132
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:42,175
The bomb will need a
33-pound ball of this size.

1133
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:47,225
Or, using plutonium,
a 10 kg ball.

1134
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:51,817
Here's the amount of uranium
Oakwood refined last month.

1135
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,667
And Hanford's plan
with Antonio this month.

1136
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:05,300
Now we can enrich these quantities.
We have to find a way to detonate them.

1137
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:07,300
Are we boring him, Edward?

1138
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,175
Partially yes.

1139
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:10,300
I asked why.

1140
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:14,475
We all knew that an
effective bomb was possible.

1141
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,725
How about leaving
him something new?

1142
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:18,175
For example?

1143
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:22,300
We use hydrogen instead
of uranium or plutonium.

1144
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:24,300
Heavy hydrogen

1145
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:28,255
deuterium.  You see,
we shrug under heavy

1146
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:32,300
pressure to trigger
a fusion reaction.

1147
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:37,300
And we don't buy
kilotons, we buy megatons.

1148
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:39,350
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1149
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:44,300
How do you generate enough
energy to fuse hydrogen atoms?

1150
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:46,350
Small goldfish.

1151
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:53,175
Since we'll need it anyway,
let's get back to work.

1152
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,875
The isotope question was
not the most important one.

1153
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,175
Disagreement in politics
with Dr. Abenheimer.

1154
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,300
It was a hydrogen bomb, right?

1155
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:07,175
Colleagues, we agreed to
disagree and agreed on many issues.

1156
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:11,175
One of them was the need
for the H-bond program.

1157
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,700
Yes.

1158
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:30,300
Banks, convenient and quickly.

1159
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,175
I know, take me.

1160
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,176
What do we know

1161
01:03:34,301 --> 01:03:38,300
One of our B-29s in the North
Pacific has detected radiation.

1162
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,275
Do we have any filter papers?

1163
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,325
There is no doubt what it is.

1164
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,175
White House officials
have been fired.

1165
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,425
I fear it is an illusion.

1166
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:47,275
Are they filter papers
for long range detection?

1167
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,300
This is an atomic test.

1168
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:57,175
The Russians have the bomb.  We
should be years ahead of them, but...

1169
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:01,225
What were you doing at Los
Alamos with the safety tank?

1170
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:03,175
Of course it was.
You were not there.

1171
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,300
I'm sorry doctor.

1172
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,195
But I was there.

1173
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:12,175
Now we can deal with the
mechanics of the explosion itself.

1174
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,300
Some idea?

1175
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,195
I call it "shooting".  Burning
a piece of fissionable material

1176
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,175
to the larger sphere with enough
force to reach a critical point.

1177
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,300
what do we think?

1178
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:25,865
I was thinking of an implosion.

1179
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:28,175
the balls explode inside
and crush the material.

1180
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,834
I would like to explore this idea.

1181
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:34,325
I'll talk to the Ordinance.  Okay,
you're blowing everything up.

1182
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:35,176
Push forward

1183
01:04:35,301 --> 01:04:37,195
It's a pleasure for
me to see you too.

1184
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,175
Meet the British contingent.

1185
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,175
This is Oppenheimer.  And Suks?

1186
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,175
How long have you been English?

1187
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,225
Ever since Hitler told
me I wasn't German.

1188
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:48,175
I have a stamp in Los Alamos.

1189
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,300
Suppose I ran?

1190
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:53,175
Distant?  It always works.

1191
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,175
This is one of the many
ways we support employees.

1192
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,245
Is it Mr. Silver?

1193
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:02,325
Yes i did it.  I have offered jobs to
all men, librarians, for the computer.

1194
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:04,175
Downsizing, keep
families together.

1195
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,175
Are these women qualified?
Do not be ridiculous.

1196
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,175
These are some of the
brightest minds in our community.

1197
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,300
And they are already
safe, they are clean.

1198
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:12,265
I've notified General
Grills that you will.

1199
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:14,275
lead local deficit
discussions each evening.

1200
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,175
Turn them off.  Compartmentation
is the key to safety.

1201
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:21,175
Only the best men.  Who can
communicate with subordinates?

1202
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,175
These men are not stupid.
They might have some common sense.

1203
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:28,100
I don't like.  You dislike
nothing enough to take a fair test.

1204
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:35,225
Once a week.  Only the best men.

1205
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:38,300
We want to bring my
brother here.  Negative.

1206
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,300
I'm Nicholas.

1207
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:44,275
I'm still nervous about
the security clearance.

1208
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,667
It's there and...
Go to Chicago tomorrow.

1209
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,175
No, you have to wait.

1210
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,725
You know the Nazis
started two years early.

1211
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:52,735
Albenheimer, the
truth about your security

1212
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,175
hard to get certified,
it's not my fault.

1213
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,176
It's yours?

1214
01:05:56,301 --> 01:05:58,295
Maybe it's not your
fault, but it's your problem.

1215
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,175
Why am I leaving

1216
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:04,300
And how many people participated
in these open discussions?

1217
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:07,175
Too many departments
should have been logged.

1218
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,367
You are in the race against the Nazis.

1219
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,175
No, the contest is
against the Soviets.

1220
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,176
Not before starting.

1221
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:16,225
Robert, the starting
gun has just been fired.

1222
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:18,375
What is the nature of the
price of their detonators?

1223
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,375
The Daily reported that these
are plutonium detonation devices.

1224
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,175
Like the one built
at Los Alamos.

1225
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:28,175
The Russians have a bomb.  Truman
needs to know what's going to happen.

1226
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,300
What's next?

1227
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,225
Talk about weapons.
He's talking about weapons.

1228
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:32,750
Naturally.

1229
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:37,300
What other superman does Truman know?
Will we become famous for this?

1230
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,175
Not particularly.

1231
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,175
We still don't know if he
underwent a hydrogen operation.

1232
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,176
Technically feasible.

1233
01:06:42,301 --> 01:06:44,175
It is true.  From what I understand,
it was the cashier who suggested it.

1234
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,176
Yes.

1235
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:47,005
The teller design has
always been wild is not

1236
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:49,925
practical.  You will have
to deliver it with an ox cart.

1237
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:51,225
It's not a plane not me

1238
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:52,175


1239
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,175
Doctor Albinheimer bread.

1240
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,176
He's coming

1241
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:56,300
NO.

1242
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,975
Because if he can get us
going again, the President

1243
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:06,300
The United States needs to know.

1244
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,365
And if the Russians
know about it since then

1245
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:14,175
He's a Los Alamos
spy, so we should go.

1246
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,175
There is no evidence
of a spy at Los Alamos.

1247
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,176
Robert.

1248
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:25,175
Put it under a football stadium.

1249
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,175
It won't work in the morning.

1250
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,700
Likewise

1251
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,175
Poppy, it's time to get down to business.

1252
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,175
What was that?

1253
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,176
My marriage

1254
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:36,175
Yes, do you have a small town?

1255
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,175
Yes, I'm at sea.

1256
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:42,175
How can one trade
in such a place?

1257
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,195
Everyone goes crazy.

1258
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,300
Thank you for your trust, Soled.

1259
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:52,175
Are we really thinking
about this nose thing?

1260
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:55,175
Will you try?

1261
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,700
We did

1262
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,175
A diversified and self-sustaining
nuclear chain reaction.

1263
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,175
Did any group tell you that?

1264
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:09,307
Dr Albinheimer?

1265
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,175
I tried with the staff.

1266
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,175
I asked if I should write it.

1267
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,176
You can do it?

1268
01:08:18,301 --> 01:08:21,901
Harvard forgot to teach it in its
chemistry undergraduate program.

1269
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,175
London, leave our sword here.

1270
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:33,175
What the hell are you doing in Chicago?

1271
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:34,175
Visiting men.

1272
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,175
Why?

1273
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,175
You can not

1274
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:37,175
Why?

1275
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,176
We have all rights.

1276
01:08:38,301 --> 01:08:40,435
You only have the
rights I grant you.

1277
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:42,300
Neither more nor less.

1278
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:44,325
We are adults looking
to start a project.

1279
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,850
This is ridiculous.

1280
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,800
Tell him

1281
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:52,050
Separation is the
protocol we agreed on.

1282
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:55,175
Enough of this madness, no
one can work in these conditions.

1283
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,176
You know it?

1284
01:08:56,301 --> 01:08:59,245
General Lee Simo, I'm done.

1285
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,300
Thanks for nothing.

1286
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:05,300
Better without him.

1287
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,175
Are you no longer worried
about his common sense?

1288
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,175
We will have him killed.

1289
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:15,300
I am joking.

1290
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,245
It's me, not America.

1291
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:21,300
General, not everyone
has trumps like me.

1292
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,825
I don't think I understand.

1293
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:25,176
You wouldn't hire me
despite my background.

1294
01:09:25,301 --> 01:09:27,175
That's why you hired me.

1295
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,175
So you can check me out.

1296
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:32,175
No, I'm not that kind.

1297
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,300
I'm just a humble soldier.

1298
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,176
You are neither
humble nor just a soldier.

1299
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:38,175
You studied engineering at MIT.

1300
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,700
Guilty of being guilty.

1301
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,176
Well, now we understand each other.

1302
01:09:41,301 --> 01:09:42,975
Maybe you can give me
my security clearance.

1303
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,634
so I can do this
miracle for you.

1304
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,635
General Groves, Doctor Open

1305
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,645
On the left when
did you name him?

1306
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:57,175
I knew there were
doubts about him.

1307
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:00,175
I knew he had a very
liberal background.

1308
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,175
Do you think you could ever
knowingly engage in unfaithful behavior?

1309
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,825
I'd be surprised if he did.

1310
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:08,175
He had full confidence
in his honesty.

1311
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,300
Alamos.

1312
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:11,475
Yes, that's exactly
how I recognized him.

1313
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,655
General, your security
guards on the project

1314
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:16,375
He advised you not to ask
Dr. Oppenheimer's permission.

1315
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,300
They couldn't and wouldn't
clean it until I insisted.

1316
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,275
And we can say with certainty
that you had a good experience.

1317
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,225
Information on
Dr. Oppenheimer's safety dossier.

1318
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:25,750
I'm not

1319
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:28,425
I have only one
question to answer today.

1320
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:32,225
In light of current AEC guidelines,
Dr. Oppenheimer's endorsement?

1321
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:34,300
Do you have any directions?

1322
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:47,175
Under current AEC rules,
Dr. Openheimer today?

1323
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:54,307
Physics and New Mexico?

1324
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,175
OMG

1325
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,175
No number

1326
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,175
That's why you
need to communicate.

1327
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,176
My name is Lominance.

1328
01:11:08,301 --> 01:11:10,175
It will all be fine

1329
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,176
This way, gentlemen.

1330
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:18,308
I have two hearts.

1331
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:26,175
Ms. Lee, I'd like to remind you
of what we discussed in Berkeley.

1332
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,300
Department, I
totally understand.

1333
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:49,025
I'm here to update you on our
progress and to ask for your input.

1334
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:51,145
I'll have to share a
few things for this.

1335
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:53,925
Things General
Groves told me not to do.

1336
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:55,175
Sorry, general, I
said I understood.

1337
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:56,834
Not that I agree.

1338
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:00,275
Well, guys, work.

1339
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,175
There were unsubstantiated
rumors of espionage by Los Alamos.

1340
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:08,175
It is assumed that there were Communists
knowingly involved in the project.

1341
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:12,395
I just want to know if anyone is
having discussions with Super.

1342
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,175
I remember you asked your
brother to come to Los Alamos.

1343
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,175
Meanwhile, my
brother left the party.

1344
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,700
And Lominance?

1345
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,176
Lominance was never
used at Los Alamos.

1346
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:21,225
He was a collector.

1347
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:23,175
As ex-Colonel Nichols was well aware,
our security arrangements were strict.

1348
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,175
Our security was
as tight as possible.

1349
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,925
notable personalities, but
attempts have been made.

1350
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:29,176
What does it mean?

1351
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:31,368
We have read all
your posts here.

1352
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,534
Do we need to talk
about Gene Tatlock?

1353
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:37,175
Or the Chevalier story?

1354
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:43,300
Excuse me

1355
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:47,300
Just a minute.  Just a minute

1356
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:54,557
Hi Rusty

1357
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,225
What?

1358
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:58,175
Okay, calm down.

1359
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:01,175
They just enlisted Lominance.

1360
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,300
We're at war, Doctor.

1361
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,175
Don't be an idiot,
Nichols.  We need this guy.

1362
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,295
Can you fix it?

1363
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,145
It wasn't a mistake.
Your friend Lominance

1364
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:11,495
was trying to assemble
the radiation lab.

1365
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,175
You promised yourself
you'd finish it all.

1366
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,175
Well, he doesn't.

1367
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,615
The Berkeley security
guard is concerned about

1368
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:22,300
Communists infiltrating the
FA FACD through this union.

1369
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,300
Anyway, next week I'll
be there and visit him.

1370
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:32,300
Your education has passed.

1371
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:40,404
It is important that you do not maintain
or renew any suspicious relationship.

1372
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:47,075
Doctor, social relationships
between one person and another,

1373
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,275
Who engages in covert warfare
and are communists dangerous?

1374
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,300
Today I would be
more aware of the risks.

1375
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:57,195
It is fair to say that
during the war years:

1376
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,325
they believed such contacts
were potentially dangerous.

1377
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:07,457
Are we unthinkably dangerous?

1378
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,300
Really?

1379
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:13,300
No communist

1380
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:17,300
You see

1381
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:22,300
For a long time I have had
many secrets in my head.

1382
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:28,300
It doesn't matter who I go out with.
I will not talk about these secrets.

1383
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:36,557
You said in your statement that you
must have seen Gene Tatlock in 1943.

1384
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,300
He walked away.

1385
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,175
Not a word.
What did you think you were doing to me?

1386
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,300
Written by

1387
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,400
Pages of nothing.

1388
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:00,175
Where did you go?

1389
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,175
I can not tell you.

1390
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,300
Why?

1391
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,300
Because you are a communist.

1392
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,350
Why did you have to see it?

1393
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:14,225
He said he wanted to
see me before he left.

1394
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:18,300
I couldn't do it at the time,
but I felt he needed to see me.

1395
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,300
He was in psychiatric care.
He was extremely unhappy.

1396
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:26,300
Did you find out why
he has to see you?

1397
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:33,300
He sat there with me.

1398
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:40,757
You spent the
night together, right?

1399
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,176
Yes.

1400
01:15:45,301 --> 01:15:52,308
You walk in and out of my life
without having to tell me why.

1401
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,300
And this power.

1402
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,584
Not that I like it.

1403
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:10,350
I'd rather be here for
you than need you.

1404
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,050
But now you have other priorities.

1405
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:15,300
I have a wife and a son.

1406
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,300
Neither of them talk about it.

1407
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,225
Gene, you asked me to come.

1408
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:29,300
And I'm glad I did.

1409
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,567
But I can't see you anymore.

1410
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,400
But what if I need you?

1411
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,300
You said you'd always answer.

1412
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,000
Is it a word?

1413
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:51,225
Did you think that was consistent
with uncertainty?  It actually was.

1414
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:53,175
Slovakian Ani

1415
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,175
Did you see it after?

1416
01:16:56,300 --> 01:17:03,307
I never saw him again.

1417
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:15,300
I can take the last
train to Princeton.

1418
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:18,175
I didn't tell you anything
that I already told you.

1419
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,575
Isn't this the day
to tell the tale?

1420
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,175
It's very close to you.

1421
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:26,300
If not, we'll use the
transcript and show it to you.

1422
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,176
I will send it

1423
01:17:27,301 --> 01:17:30,175
You ask me when
did you see Geno?

1424
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:34,300
No, you... You're sitting there.

1425
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:39,175
Every day we let them
tear our lives apart.

1426
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:43,300
Why don't you fight?

1427
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:50,300
Dad, I'm not putting it in there.

1428
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,401
Doctor Rama, this is art.
Please sit down.

1429
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,375
Maybe... I just wanted
to see if I could do it.

1430
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,675
Considering your concerns, he should have
spoken to you in more minutes while I was here.

1431
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,175
I'd say it's up to you,
professor, but I'd be careful.

1432
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,300
She understood

1433
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:11,345
And as for the Union,
I wanted you and

1434
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:14,275
a man named Elton
to watch your back.

1435
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,800
Attention?

1436
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:19,300
Yeah, maybe he's
watching it himself.

1437
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:23,375
I would like to
have more details.

1438
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,225
I have an idea, but now and
tomorrow I will leave early.

1439
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:29,350
I'll be back anytime,
if you have time.

1440
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:31,176
You came back the next morning.

1441
01:18:31,301 --> 01:18:33,175
I did, I had to.

1442
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:34,700
Really?

1443
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,967
This time there
was a different man.

1444
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:39,175
He said his name was Pasha.

1445
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,176
Pas.

1446
01:18:40,301 --> 01:18:42,175
You met Colonel Pasha.

1447
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,405
Colonel Pash, please.

1448
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:47,225
Is he reading his
memorandum of June 29, 1943?

1449
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:50,975
Recommended by the
monitoring results of the subjects

1450
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:54,175
other possible links with
the Communist Party.

1451
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,065
Subject met a person
and spent a lot of time

1452
01:18:57,190 --> 01:19:00,175
From Gene, Tatlock, a
communist, whose card is attached.

1453
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,300
It's about Dr. Raupmanhund.

1454
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:03,176
Yes.

1455
01:19:03,301 --> 01:19:05,175
The person you haven't met yet.

1456
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:06,775
Not that, but right after.

1457
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,175
He's the project's head of
security, shouldn't I know him?

1458
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,300
No, he should recognize you.

1459
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,175
I will never put you in the
same room with Pasha.

1460
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,300
Why?

1461
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,915
When Pash found out, he told
the FBI he was going to kidnap him.

1462
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:23,175
board the ship and interrogate
him the Russian way.

1463
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:27,595
General Groves has given
me some responsibilities.

1464
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:31,300
and its like having a
baby and i cant see it.

1465
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,300
I have a remote.

1466
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:37,100
So we need you.

1467
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:40,300
I won't take up much of your time.

1468
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,650
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll tell you the truth.

1469
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:44,665
Mr. Johnson told me about
yesterday's conversation.

1470
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:46,275
that he really interested me.

1471
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,467
He said he worked all day.

1472
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:52,300
Yes, I didn't want to talk to
Luminance without permission.

1473
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,765
I have no particular
interest, but...

1474
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:59,175
something more, I
think more serious.

1475
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,065
Now that the FBI has
highlighted such a thing.

1476
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:03,265
the information will not
be admissible in court,

1477
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:05,060
Pash made it clear that
he didn't have that intention.

1478
01:20:05,185 --> 01:20:07,225
Leave no witnesses
for the prosecution.

1479
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:11,175
The FBI talked him out of it, but
he's the guy you were dancing with.

1480
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,725
Did you hear that together
there are also other parties

1481
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:16,575
interested in the work of
the radiation laboratory?

1482
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:19,027
A man of the Soviet Council

1483
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:22,405
through the law of mediation

1484
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:28,275
who was able to convey information
to people involved in the project.

1485
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,300
NO,

1486
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:34,655
Honestly, I see it happening.

1487
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:37,265
argument that the commander-in-chief
must provide information

1488
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:39,875
The Russians are
allies after all, but I don't

1489
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,345
like the idea of ​​it going
through the back door.

1490
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:45,670
Maybe that wouldn't be bad.
I'll keep an eye on it.

1491
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,195
And did you tell the Pasha?

1492
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:52,175
I was trying to place it in the
context of Russia, not Germany.

1493
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:56,205
Ors Pash is the son of a
Russian Orthodox bishop.  he born

1494
01:20:56,330 --> 01:21:00,175
here but returned to Russia
in 1918 to fight the Bolsheviks.

1495
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,175
This is a man who killed the
Communists with his own hands.

1496
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:06,265
I don't decide who has
information and who doesn't.

1497
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:09,925
It's my job to legally
prevent him from graduating.

1498
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:12,050
Can you be a
little more specific?

1499
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:19,300
There is a man whose name has
been mentioned a few times.  Eltonton.

1500
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:23,300
I think he's a Shell chemist.

1501
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:29,300
He was talking to a friend who
knew someone from the project.

1502
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,175
And he thought he would be fine?

1503
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,225
Tried to give them
Eltonton without opening it.

1504
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:39,425
A can of worms, a rooster
for you and a ghost, I told them.

1505
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:41,175
Do you let the general grow too?

1506
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:44,175
Negative.  I confess
to him that I want to die.

1507
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:48,300
Do you remember his
speech on the Chevalier affair?

1508
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,995
I've seen too many versions, but
I've never gotten confused before.

1509
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,175
but now I will definitely come.

1510
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,300
What was your conclusion?

1511
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,325
A typical American student
is under the influence of

1512
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:03,300
the idea that there is
something wrong to tell a friend.

1513
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:08,300
Naturally.  When can we
expect to be contacted?

1514
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,467
People who are not included
in this project are not included.

1515
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:15,300
Is this person a
member of the project?

1516
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:19,300
Faculty member yes,
but not project member.

1517
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:22,015
So Eltonon made his approach

1518
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:25,300
Through a Berkeley
faculty member?

1519
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:34,300
As far as I know, yes.  More
people could have been involved.

1520
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:43,265
If I sound uncooperative, I
think you can understand why.

1521
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:47,524
I can't accept my insistence on
keeping innocent people out of trouble.

1522
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,175
You're trying to protect your
partner.  Who is protecting you?

1523
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:55,300
You did it.  If you gave me a name,
you are giving me an order.  I will do it.

1524
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,175
It's a mistake, Robert.  You
must enter this name voluntarily.

1525
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,175
Why are you without?

1526
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,175
He did, but that's
not the point, is it?

1527
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,175
Negative Negative.  It actually
happened a few months later, right?

1528
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,300
It was not like this.

1529
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,175
It seems that he is
the one who insists.

1530
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:12,325
Well, you... you're
pushy, but that's your job.

1531
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:16,175
And my job is to protect
the people who work for me.

1532
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:21,175
Instead of going through some
steps that may distract you and

1533
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:26,300
might interest you, I would like
to talk to you about them first.

1534
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:30,300
I'm making a plan, I'll
have to digest everything.

1535
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:36,455
In the months
between your interview

1536
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:38,825
and Dr. Oppenheimer
and his possible name

1537
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,815
Knight, you have
wasted resources.

1538
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:43,325
are you trying to find out
the name of the broker?

1539
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:48,175
Relevant sources, yes.  Our
anonymous activity was extremely difficult.

1540
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,575
And when did you get your name?

1541
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,175
When Oppenheimer
proposed, he walked out.

1542
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,176
distant?

1543
01:23:53,301 --> 01:23:55,725
They thought it would be better
to spend my time in Europe.

1544
01:23:55,850 --> 01:23:58,175
Where can I find the status
of the Nazi bomb project?

1545
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,700
Who made it?

1546
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:04,300
General Groves.
He moved me to London.

1547
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:11,957
It's a little early for
a Christmas party.

1548
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,175
Something is happening.
Looks like he's gone.

1549
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,176
Where is it?

1550
01:24:17,301 --> 01:24:19,300
The ancient city of Ruth.

1551
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:32,175
Come on, think about it.  You
can't tell me who you can tell.

1552
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:37,175
What makes you
think I know where it is?

1553
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:41,175
Because you know damn well what
Mr. Dorman is when it comes to him.

1554
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,175
Like now?

1555
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:46,175
Attention!

1556
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:51,300
An early Christmas
present for you all.

1557
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:06,175
The British driver caught me on the basketball court.
They filled me up with oxygen, but I screwed it up.

1558
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:09,175
I was unconscious when
I opened in Scotland.

1559
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:12,175
But I pretended to sleep.

1560
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,175
It's a core group.

1561
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:18,300
Big enough to end the war.

1562
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:27,300
Heisenberg called
me in Copenhagen.

1563
01:25:28,050 --> 01:25:31,545
I'm cold, my former
student worked for the Nazis.

1564
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:35,300
He said a few
things to get me out.

1565
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:38,175
Permanent fission
reactions in uranium.

1566
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:42,425
It looks more like a reactor than a bomb.
Did you mention gas diffusion?

1567
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:45,175
It seemed more
focused on heavy water.

1568
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,176
As a moderator?

1569
01:25:46,301 --> 01:25:48,300
Yes, instead of graphite.

1570
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:53,350
What?

1571
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:55,175
He went the wrong way.

1572
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:56,700
Or head.

1573
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,825
And you were here
to help us, Nils?

1574
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:02,300
Will you excuse us for a moment?

1575
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:10,607
I wasn't here to help Robert.

1576
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,625
I knew you could
make it without me.

1577
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:16,175
where do you come from?

1578
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,300
We'll talk later.

1579
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,334
The power you are about to
unleash will leave the Nazis forever.

1580
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,300
And the world is not ready.

1581
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:26,575
You took the stone unprepared
for the pain that would result.

1582
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:30,300
We need to let politicians know
that this is not a new weapon.

1583
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,300
It's a new world.

1584
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:35,300
I'll do my best
there, except for you.

1585
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:38,300
You are the Prometheus of America.

1586
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:42,300
The man who gave them the
power to destroy themselves.

1587
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,300
And they will respect it.

1588
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,300
And your work
will start very soon.

1589
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:54,300
Sorry, Oppie, but I got a call.

1590
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,300
Zo San Francisco.

1591
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:05,300
Robert

1592
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,500
Robert

1593
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,300
Robert

1594
01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:16,245
What happened?

1595
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:19,300
My father called

1596
01:27:19,950 --> 01:27:22,300
We found it in the
bathtub yesterday.

1597
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:24,176
WEAVING?

1598
01:27:24,301 --> 01:27:26,300
He took some pills

1599
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:29,300
He left a note when he saw it.

1600
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:33,175
He was taking barbiturates
with Nils Chloraleiride in his blood.

1601
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:38,175
There was a note.

1602
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:40,225
He looked out of the castle.

1603
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:47,357
We were together

1604
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,300
Said you needed me, I...

1605
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,175
I do not know

1606
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:55,175
I do not do it.

1607
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:56,175
I do not know

1608
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,700
I can not come

1609
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,300
No, it wasn't me.  It was me.

1610
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:03,865
you can't come to the city.

1611
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:07,175
the whole nose stinks, so
every particle has an outcome.

1612
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:11,300
Poor insult, Dickens.

1613
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:18,557
It will be clear that
he will bow to you.

1614
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:23,175
Donald, would you like
to contribute here please?

1615
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,176
you're awake

1616
01:28:24,301 --> 01:28:28,045
Mom, I won't quit my job
because plutonium is radioactive.

1617
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:30,175
We don't know what it can do to
the female reproductive system.

1618
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:33,175
Your reproductive system
is more exposed than mine.

1619
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,176
Please tell me

1620
01:28:34,301 --> 01:28:36,175
Zoom the device to nowhere.

1621
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,175
Not everything can be rushed.

1622
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:40,175
Well, the rush is there
and it's coming, so take it.

1623
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:42,175
You are right.
A man who does his job.

1624
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,175
Tell us what's going on.

1625
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:45,176
You are no help

1626
01:28:45,301 --> 01:28:48,175
For weeks, I've been asking for the pops
at the bottom of your fluorescent lenses.

1627
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:49,175
The British can do it.
Insurance

1628
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:50,176
Absolutely yes.

1629
01:28:50,301 --> 01:28:52,300
It's your job, Tada.

1630
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,175
do a search

1631
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,767
We hide neither.
We don't even build them.

1632
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:06,175
I brought one to the event.

1633
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,700
Leave him

1634
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,175
his departure

1635
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,176
Is that Prima Donna?

1636
01:29:10,301 --> 01:29:12,175
I accept.  She has to go now.

1637
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,700
Naturally.

1638
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:17,175
Kisti, swap Metabytes.
Seth, I'm giving you plutonium.

1639
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:19,300
Lily, go see Kisti.

1640
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:22,175
Fuchs, take the role of
Tad because he needs you.

1641
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:25,175
I'll only grant you
the explosive device.

1642
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:29,300
And nobody leaves Los Alamos.

1643
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:45,175
Both believed.

1644
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:48,175
Negative.  I won't let you go.

1645
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:51,300
Forget Hans.  Forget Fuchs.

1646
01:29:51,550 --> 01:29:54,175
He stays here.  Find out what you want.

1647
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:56,300
Fuchs and the hydrogen bomb.

1648
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,175
However, we will
meet to discuss.

1649
01:29:58,300 --> 01:29:59,176
You don't have time to go out.

1650
01:29:59,301 --> 01:30:01,175
You're a politician now, Robert.

1651
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:04,325
You dropped out of
physics many years ago.

1652
01:30:04,450 --> 01:30:08,300
A week.  At one o'clock.
Me and you.

1653
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:16,007
Now remove the damn barrier.

1654
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:23,307
So the lack of development of
your Los Alamos watch was great.

1655
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:25,700
Yes.

1656
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,175
Yet after the war you tried
to deny that it was feasible.

1657
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:32,300
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Technically, I claimed the opposite.

1658
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:35,375
Didn't you try to kill him at the AEC
meeting after the Russian bomb test?

1659
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:39,300
No, no, no.  But that was the
recommendation of the AEC, wasn't it?

1660
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,401
The best answer after
hours of discussion.

1661
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:48,300
The hydrogen bomb is a thousand
times more powerful than the atomic bomb.

1662
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:52,750
His only target will
be the biggest city.

1663
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:54,176
A weapon of mass genocide.

1664
01:30:54,301 --> 01:30:57,300
It's circling this
side of the map,

1665
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:00,175
Where will they take us,
starting from New York?

1666
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:01,300
I'm in Washington.

1667
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:05,175
It's an offensive weapon.  There is
no difference in terms of deterrence.

1668
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:09,175
Do we really need a greater deterrent
than our slow nukes that are our friends?

1669
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:13,175
If you drown in three meters or three thousand
meters of water, what's the difference?

1670
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:15,175
We might drown anyway.

1671
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:17,767
We can only drown on two legs.

1672
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:31,715
As I said, the treasurers'
proposals are still there.

1673
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:34,175
it is not as practical
as during the war.

1674
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:37,175
A hydrogen bomb
might work, I'll know.

1675
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:40,175
I don't think we should devote all
of our resources to this opportunity.

1676
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:43,475
So how would you like Truman
to reassure the American people?

1677
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,425
Simply limiting the
spread of atomic weapons.

1678
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:48,675
through international
control and nuclear energy.

1679
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,175
I mean a world government.

1680
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:53,175
The United Nations
was Roosevelt's intention.

1681
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:56,175
I asked what Truman
was supposed to do, right?

1682
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,448
It is communism, not fascism,
that will change the world.

1683
01:31:58,573 --> 01:32:00,175
which now
threatens our survival.

1684
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:04,300
Lewis, do you realize that if
we build a hydrogen bomb,

1685
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,175
the Russians will have no
choice but to build their own.

1686
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:08,725
Maybe they are
already working on it,

1687
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:11,175
Information obtained
from a Los Alamos spy?

1688
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:12,225
No spies at Los Alamos.

1689
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:15,417
Friends, let's not
divert the subject.

1690
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,175
I think we should use this momentum
to get concessions from the Russians.

1691
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:21,325
promising not to build
a hydrogen bomb.

1692
01:32:21,450 --> 01:32:23,450
In this way, it
reveals its existence.

1693
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,575
You convinced yourself
that they already know.

1694
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:30,195
Sure sure.  Right now, I
want committee members

1695
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,175
They met privately and
finalized our proposals.

1696
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:36,175
Not sure if you want
to go just for that.

1697
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:40,300
With all due respect, we are an
advisory board.  We will recommend them.

1698
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:42,175
Naturally.

1699
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:46,300
Doctor Oppenheimer

1700
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:47,900
HI.

1701
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:49,750
William Borden.

1702
01:32:49,950 --> 01:32:51,175
He joins the Atomic
Energy Commission.

1703
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,300
This.

1704
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:55,300
I was a pilot during the war.

1705
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:59,175
One night, returning from a
raid, I saw an incredible sight.

1706
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:04,175
I have a meteor.  The V-2
rocket was headed for England.

1707
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:06,675
I can't help but
imagine what an enemy

1708
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,275
missile carrying atomic
warfare would be like.

1709
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,175
Silence

1710
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:18,307
Let's make sure it's not us.

1711
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:31,575
Bobby, I don't think
you want to face Shros.

1712
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:34,300
If we both talk,
they'll listen to me.

1713
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:36,384
They hear the prophet
when you speak.

1714
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:38,325
When Shros speaks,
they hear each other.

1715
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:40,295
Listen to the Prophet

1716
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:43,175
A prophet cannot be wrong.
Not even once.

1717
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:47,300
Did you accuse Oppenheimer of
sabotaging the development of the super?

1718
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:51,525
I've never been one to
misunderstand terms like sabotage.

1719
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:53,300
But was Mr. Borden?

1720
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:55,175
As I understand it, maybe.

1721
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:59,175
How did Mr. Borden draw
up such a detailed indictment?

1722
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,175
He was no longer
a public servant.

1723
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:04,525
Apparently, Dr. Oppenheimer had
unlimited access to his file.  Oppenheimer

1724
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:09,175
Like mr.  Nichols, I gave him or someone
else from the AEC access to the file.

1725
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:12,300
These are very
serious allegations.

1726
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:14,005
it is your intention
to insinuate that

1727
01:34:14,130 --> 01:34:17,075
Is Dr. Oppenheimer
disloyal to the United States?

1728
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,450
I always thought
and still think that he

1729
01:34:19,575 --> 01:34:21,275
was loyal to the United
States of America.

1730
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:26,175
I believe this to be true and will read it
until I see convincing evidence to the contrary.

1731
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:30,300
Believe it or not, is Dr. Oppenheimer
a prisoner of security?

1732
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:51,115
We should at least
think about it for a

1733
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:54,300
moment, because the
means justify the ends.

1734
01:34:56,850 --> 01:34:59,175
Germany is about to surrender.

1735
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,176
Yes.

1736
01:35:00,301 --> 01:35:06,300
Mr. Bonger, the enemy is the greatest
threat to humanity, that's our job.

1737
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:11,300
He was dead.  That's right.

1738
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,600
Japanese combat

1739
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:16,625
Their defeat seems certain.

1740
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:19,175
Not if you're a GI
ready to invade.

1741
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:21,175
We can end this war.

1742
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:25,300
But how can we justify
the use of this weapon?

1743
01:35:28,650 --> 01:35:30,175
We are theorists.

1744
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:31,700
Yes.

1745
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:37,300
We imagine the future and
our imagination scares us.

1746
01:35:38,350 --> 01:35:40,695
They will not fear it
until they understand it.

1747
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:43,300
they won't understand
it until they use it.

1748
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:47,175
When the world discovered
the terrible secret of Los Alamos,

1749
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:50,175
Our work here will bring about a
peace humanity has never seen.

1750
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:53,175
A peace based on a
form of international peace

1751
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:56,300
The cooperation that
Roosevelt always expected.

1752
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:02,275
A step forward?

1753
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,175
Two years and a million dollars.

1754
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:07,175
It is difficult to determine
the price in your city.

1755
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:08,176
Not exactly.
Only from accounts.

1756
01:36:08,301 --> 01:36:10,175
Free rural deliveries.

1757
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:12,325
In the first year, 80
children were born.

1758
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:15,225
This year ten are born a month.

1759
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:18,175
Checks on lands that do not
comply with the general restriction.

1760
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:19,175
Clearly general.

1761
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:20,700


1762
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:27,175
Upside down

1763
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:28,175
Let's go

1764
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:29,700
Everybody keep your heads down.

1765
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:38,175
That's what war is like.

1766
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:39,175
Two suicide bombers.

1767
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:40,700
I need an appointment.

1768
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:44,175
September.

1769
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:45,176
July.

1770
01:36:45,301 --> 01:36:48,275
That's great, guys.

1771
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,175
August.

1772
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:51,175
July.

1773
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:52,175
Stairs

1774
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,176
July.

1775
01:36:53,301 --> 01:36:55,300
I need my brother

1776
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:00,175
Frank goes to the desert.

1777
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,176
He leaves politics behind.

1778
01:37:01,301 --> 01:37:03,568
He's been working with Mars for two years.

1779
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:14,175
What do we call the test?

1780
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:18,175
The animal of my heart.
God for three.

1781
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:20,175
What?

1782
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:22,300
Really

1783
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:32,175
You insisted on bringing
your brother Frank.

1784
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:33,175
A known communist.

1785
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:34,700
Former communist

1786
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:37,175
You brought in a
known ex-communist.

1787
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:40,175
The most secret and important
American defense project.

1788
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:42,175
I knew my brother
could be trusted.

1789
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:43,700
Absolutely yes.

1790
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,675
And you felt that your judgment of
who the team can be trusted was correct.

1791
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,175
Everybody keep your heads down.

1792
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:51,300
Everyone ready?

1793
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:02,175
Hope you learned something.

1794
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:04,175
We learned that we should
have been much further away.

1795
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:05,175
I will solve the problem

1796
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:06,175
Quickly

1797
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:07,175
We need Washington
in the morning.

1798
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:08,700
We will give him a date.

1799
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:26,175
You're a long way
from Chicago, Leo.

1800
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:29,225
If we don't act now, they'll
use this thing in eastern Japan.

1801
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:32,425
We had set up a meeting with
Truman, but someone screwed it up.

1802
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:34,175
You met the Minister of War.

1803
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:36,300
The fact that we built it

1804
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,125
does not mean that we
have to decide how to use it.

1805
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:41,300
History will judge us for this.

1806
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:44,417
We have prepared
a petition in Chicago.

1807
01:38:44,850 --> 01:38:47,584
I... I'm not telling you to.

1808
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,175
Tell me your worries
and I'll let them go.

1809
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:54,700
My worries?

1810
01:38:55,150 --> 01:38:56,550
Germany is defeated.

1811
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:58,175
Japan cannot survive on its own.

1812
01:38:58,300 --> 01:38:59,175
How do you know?

1813
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,300
You put us in this situation.

1814
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:03,225
You and Einstein with your letter to
Roosevelt saying we can build the bomb.

1815
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:04,176
Germany, I believe

1816
01:39:04,301 --> 01:39:07,175
That's not how
weapons are made, Cillit.

1817
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:08,175
I hope you will have to help me.

1818
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:09,175
Stop at a meeting.

1819
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:10,175
Lawrence during a meeting.

1820
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:11,300
Is not you

1821
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:13,175
You are a big science salesman.

1822
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:16,300
You can convince
anyone of anything.

1823
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:19,300
Even about yourself

1824
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:21,500
Excuse me

1825
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:24,175
A firestorm in Tokyo
kills 100,000 people.

1826
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:27,300
Mostly civilians

1827
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:30,175
When we do these things and
no one objects, I fear for America.

1828
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:33,175
Pearl Harbor and three years
of brutal conflict in the Pacific.

1829
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:36,767
It gains too much favor
with the American public.

1830
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,176
Is it enough to see
the target bomb?

1831
01:39:38,301 --> 01:39:42,175
An aerial bomb may not do as
much damage as the Tokyo bombs.

1832
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:43,176
What are we assuming?

1833
01:39:43,301 --> 01:39:48,175
20,000 or 30,000 dead
in a medium sized city.

1834
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:54,300
However, don't underestimate the
psychological impact of an atomic explosion.

1835
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:58,175
A 10,000 foot pillar of fire.

1836
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:02,300
Lethal effects of neutrons
from a kilometer in all directions.

1837
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:07,175
From a single device dropped
from the little-known SP-29.

1838
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:13,300
The atomic bomb will be a
terrible revelation of divine power.

1839
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:16,325
If true, it will be certain.

1840
01:40:16,450 --> 01:40:18,575
World War II will be over.

1841
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:20,225
My parents came home.

1842
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:22,300
Military targets.

1843
01:40:22,970 --> 01:40:24,725
But none of them are big enough.

1844
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:30,300
Possibly a vital war facility
with workers housed nearby.

1845
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:33,675
And we can give a warning
to reduce civilian casualties.

1846
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,175
They would send everything
they have against us.

1847
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:37,775
I was about to
get on that plane.

1848
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:40,300
But if we advertise it
and it doesn't work..,

1849
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:43,475
We will destroy the
possibility of Japan's surrender.

1850
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,175
Is there no way to show Japan
the bomb and offer surrender?

1851
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:51,175
We intend to show it
as clearly as possible.

1852
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:52,275
Twice

1853
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,175
Show the power of weapons
once and the other to

1854
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:58,175
prove that we can
make it until they give up.

1855
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:01,300
We have a list of 12
places to choose from.

1856
01:41:01,450 --> 01:41:03,300
Sorry, 11.

1857
01:41:03,650 --> 01:41:05,175
I took Kyoto off the list.

1858
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:08,367
Because of its cultural
importance to the Japanese people.

1859
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,875
My wife and I spent
our honeymoon there.

1860
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,467
It's a wonderful city.

1861
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,325
Let me make
things easier for you.

1862
01:41:18,450 --> 01:41:21,175
which, according
to my intelligence.

1863
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,275
I can't share it with you,
the Japanese don't give up.

1864
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:25,175
Under all circumstances.

1865
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:28,900
Successful and total occupation
of the main islands soon after.

1866
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:32,175
Many lives will be the longest
of Americans and Japanese.

1867
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:35,825
The use of the atomic bomb
in Japanese cities saves lives.

1868
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:38,175
If we have a moral advantage.

1869
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:39,176
What do you think about this?

1870
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:40,796
If we use this weapon
without warning.

1871
01:41:40,921 --> 01:41:42,176
our allies will
see it as a threat.

1872
01:41:42,301 --> 01:41:44,301
We will find ourselves
in an arms race.

1873
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:46,725
How often can we
be with the Soviets?

1874
01:41:46,850 --> 01:41:50,225
Secrecy will not prevent the
Soviets from joining the atomic world.

1875
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:52,175
We were told they
didn't have any uranium.

1876
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:54,225
You have been misinformed.

1877
01:41:54,350 --> 01:41:56,175
The Russian bomb is imminent.

1878
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:59,367
After the war the program
must continue at full speed.

1879
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,176
Minister Simpson, if I may.

1880
01:42:02,301 --> 01:42:06,225
Not all project
scientists agree.

1881
01:42:06,350 --> 01:42:09,595
In fact, this may be a good time
to consider other points of view.

1882
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:12,175
If you will speak as soon as possible
this project will not be disturbed from

1883
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:17,300
the outset by some scientists of
questionable judgment and uncertain loyalty.

1884
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,775
One of them just tried
to see the President.

1885
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:23,225
We need these guys now,
but as soon as we can, we

1886
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:25,225
need to remove this
scientist from the program.

1887
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:27,300
Don't you agree, doctor?

1888
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:30,300
If a Russian bomb is needed,

1889
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:33,525
perhaps we should invite
the best scientists to Trinity.

1890
01:42:33,650 --> 01:42:37,300
President Truman has no
plans to raise expectations,

1891
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:40,175
to be included in
Stalin's atomic project.

1892
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:41,809
Inform him of our discovery
and present it to him.

1893
01:42:41,934 --> 01:42:43,475
as a way to win the war.

1894
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,400
he made no promises
that could not be kept.

1895
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:49,175
However, the Potsdam peace
conference will be held in July.

1896
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:52,025
The last chance for President
Truman to give a speech of this kind.

1897
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:54,300
Can you give us a
working bomb by then?

1898
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,300
Absolutely yes.  We'll test
fire before the conference.

1899
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:06,407
Ground floor.  The observation point has
10,000 meters to the north, south and west.

1900
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:10,300
Where do we start from?

1901
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,175
South 10,000.

1902
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:15,225
Base camp is 10
miles south of here.

1903
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:21,300
There is another hilltop
lookout 20 miles away.

1904
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:23,175
Is that so?
Your lines are already here.

1905
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:27,175
The Air Force has requested
a lightweight line for its B-29s.

1906
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:29,175
Which B-29?
Our bombs in the tower.

1907
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:33,175
They want to use the test
to verify the safe distance.

1908
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:34,175
It's risky

1909
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:35,176
But it's not as risky as
dropping someone on Japan.

1910
01:43:35,301 --> 01:43:37,175
and they hoped we were
right about the blast radius.

1911
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:40,175
It's a little surprising.
We shoot 15.

1912
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:42,300
The 15?  This is the 15th.

1913
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:45,700
15.

1914
01:43:46,950 --> 01:43:51,175
with Frank and Kistiakowsky
at the Southern Observation

1915
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:54,176
Point, we will all be
assigned to base camp,

1916
01:43:54,301 --> 01:43:57,175
sunset or fire observations.

1917
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:04,307
Pay some attention to the eyes.

1918
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:15,175
The safety distances
depend on your calculations.

1919
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:18,500
It's literally time to defend
your science weapons.

1920
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:50,175
And the radiation cloud?

1921
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:53,175
It should settle within two to three
miles in the absence of strong winds.

1922
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:55,175
Vacuum measures in progress.

1923
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:59,175
But we need good weather
for visibility so it should be good.

1924
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:01,175
All out

1925
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:08,307
You are 15 at night.

1926
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:14,176
It's a difficult term.

1927
01:45:14,301 --> 01:45:17,300
If someone does something,
he speaks right away.

1928
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:43,300
Can you survive the blast test?

1929
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:48,175
It was not possible

1930
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:51,300
Is there anything
else that can stop us?

1931
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:27,175
What's going on, huh?

1932
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:31,175
I will send a message

1933
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:34,175
He worked for us.

1934
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:36,175
Take it to the street

1935
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:41,175
Robert.

1936
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:45,300
Rick Land.

1937
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:55,295
Three years, 4,000
people, $2 billion.

1938
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:57,300
So it won't come out.

1939
01:49:57,950 --> 01:49:59,350
We're both done.

1940
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:04,175
Three kilotons, I think.

1941
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:05,176
Less things?

1942
01:50:05,301 --> 01:50:07,300
I don't understand
what happened.

1943
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:11,175
And what did Fermi mean
by atmospheric ignition?

1944
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:13,175
There was a moment
when it seemed like a chain

1945
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:16,425
reaction of the atomic
bomb could never stop.

1946
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:19,175
Ignition of the atmosphere

1947
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:22,225
And what was Fermi
still doing in side bets?

1948
01:50:22,350 --> 01:50:24,300
Let's call it gallows humor.

1949
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:33,225
Are we saying that if we push this button
we have a chance to destroy the world?

1950
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:37,175
In more than three years of research,
nothing has led to this conclusion.

1951
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:40,175
It's just the most unlikely.

1952
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:41,300
How far?

1953
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:43,300
The chances are almost nil.

1954
01:50:44,550 --> 01:50:46,300
Almost none

1955
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:49,175
What do you just want from the theory?

1956
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:53,300
Zero would be fine.

1957
01:50:54,350 --> 01:51:01,225
An hour and 58
minutes behind us.

1958
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:03,175
Optimal.

1959
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:10,300
Load.

1960
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:24,175
Military parties left zero.

1961
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:25,175
They go this way.

1962
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:26,175
Throw me the keys.

1963
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:27,175
Spin the cars

1964
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:28,176
Ready for the emergency.

1965
01:51:28,301 --> 01:51:30,300
After the photo shoot.

1966
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:57,300
Everyone, get on your cylinders.

1967
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:54,300
Twenty minutes

1968
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:07,175
Winds.

1969
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:12,175
Gentleman

1970
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:14,175
Arriving

1971
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:15,175
Now.

1972
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:16,175
In glass

1973
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:17,176
Blocks UV rays.

1974
01:53:17,301 --> 01:53:19,175
Block the glass.

1975
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:22,175
I had a base of 10.

1976
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:24,175
This is fire

1977
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:26,175
Robert.

1978
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,300
Try to work in the world.

1979
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:41,176
What does it mean?

1980
01:53:41,301 --> 01:53:45,175
If the detonator is still charged,
the voltage will drop by one volt.

1981
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:47,175
If you push that
button, you break it.

1982
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:48,700
I will start

1983
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:00,175
Everyone down

1984
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:04,175
Don't fold until you see
what works in the hills.

1985
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:08,175
Then watch the explosion it
causes on your eyeglasses.

1986
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:09,176
I will keep it here.

1987
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:11,175
Create a detonator.

1988
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:15,175
Are you in favor of
these two explosions?

1989
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:17,175
Do you think I exist?

1990
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:18,700
Yes.

1991
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:45,175
These things are
heavy on your heart.

1992
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:47,175
Thirty seconds

1993
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:53,300
Give me your rate.

1994
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:08,300
I have a match, I have a match,
I'm in.  I have a game, Quattro.

1995
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:25,307
Nine.  Eight.  Seven.  Six.
Five.  Four.  Three.  Four.

1996
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:38,300
Three.  Two.  One

1997
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:18,607
And now I'm Conde,
destroyer of worlds.

1998
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:53,300
It worked

1999
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:31,175
No dollar interest.

2000
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:33,175
Continues

2001
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:35,175
I'm fine like this, Kisti.

2002
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:37,175
AND.

2003
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:39,300
Yes, six

2004
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:19,300
Give me the vase immediately.

2005
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:50,175
HI.

2006
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:51,175
Hi Cyst

2007
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:52,175
What?

2008
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:53,175
Charlotte.

2009
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:54,176
Charlotte, go on.

2010
01:59:54,301 --> 01:59:56,175
I do not know

2011
01:59:56,300 --> 01:59:59,300
Can I help you with the cheese?

2012
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:05,300
kittens?

2013
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:17,475
If they had flown it very high, the
explosion would have been just as powerful.

2014
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:21,300
With all due respect,
Dr. Oppenheimer, we've got you covered.

2015
02:00:31,550 --> 02:00:34,425
Real vase holder,
stolen for a short time.

2016
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:37,300
A brief description
would be an exaggeration.

2017
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:43,175
He was talking about a powerful
new weapon that was stolen.

2018
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:47,300
I hope we will use
it against Japan.

2019
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:49,300
That's all

2020
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:54,300
Where we gave them
an Ace is to play hands.

2021
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:57,300
You are a six pack.

2022
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:00,300
About CO in the Pacific.

2023
02:01:00,450 --> 02:01:04,175
If anything happens, Washington.

2024
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:07,295
Before.

2025
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:10,300
When you will be informed.

2026
02:01:10,450 --> 02:01:13,300
Naturally.

2027
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:16,300
To the best of my knowledge.

2028
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:36,175
What would the Japanese give
up if they knew what awaited them?

2029
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:40,175
I do not know

2030
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:42,175
Everything is here,
this is the petition.

2031
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:47,300
How is this possible regardless of
Japanese?  Not signing an article?

2032
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:50,175
Many people are like that.
Many people.

2033
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:52,300
Pydrode

2034
02:01:52,700 --> 02:01:55,415
The fact that we have
established this link any other

2035
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:58,625
right or responsibility
to decide how to use it.

2036
02:01:58,750 --> 02:02:00,175
And no one else.

2037
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:02,175
But they are the only ones who know.

2038
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:05,175
I explained the passages in the
various points of view of the congregation.

2039
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:07,300
But what is your opinion?

2040
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:11,300
When this is used, the
battle will become clear.

2041
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:17,300
Perhaps all wars will
become unthinkable.

2042
02:02:17,650 --> 02:02:20,300
Until someone makes
a bigger connection.

2043
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,300
I thought they would call.

2044
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:46,300
Very fast.

2045
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:48,300
And this is the sixth.

2046
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:04,300
Charlotte?

2047
02:03:04,650 --> 02:03:07,175
Triggers?

2048
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:10,300
Anything?

2049
02:03:10,650 --> 02:03:12,175
Charlotte?

2050
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:14,300
Trumpet on the radio

2051
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:57,225
general?

2052
02:03:57,350 --> 02:04:00,175
I am proud of you
and all your people.

2053
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:02,175
It went well

2054
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:05,300
Apparently it exploded
with an explosion.

2055
02:04:05,450 --> 02:04:10,300
Everyone here feels pretty good.

2056
02:04:11,150 --> 02:04:12,300
It's been a long journey.

2057
02:04:12,450 --> 02:04:15,115
I think it was one of the
smartest things I've ever done

2058
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:18,300
That's when I chose the
director of Los Alamos.

2059
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:25,705
we asked for
two billion dollars.

2060
02:04:25,830 --> 02:04:32,300
the greatest scientific
gamble in history and we won.

2061
02:05:59,350 --> 02:06:04,300
The world will
remember this day.

2062
02:06:23,170 --> 02:06:28,115
it is too early to tell

2063
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:32,175
What are the
consequences of a bombing?

2064
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:35,101
But I bet the
Japanese don't like it.

2065
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:57,175
I'm honored.

2066
02:06:57,300 --> 02:07:04,307
I am proud of what
you have achieved.

2067
02:07:06,850 --> 02:07:11,250
I wish we had time to
use it against the Germans.

2068
02:08:58,350 --> 02:09:05,357
Doctor Oppenheimer.  Doctor
Oppenheimer.  It's beautiful.

2069
02:09:08,706 --> 02:09:15,713
Image.  The inmates need help.

2070
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:28,175
Dr. Oppenheimer, I'm honoured.
Mr. President, please.  Thank you.

2071
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:31,300
16 minutes.

2072
02:09:32,150 --> 02:09:35,665
How does it feel to be the
most famous man in the world?

2073
02:09:35,790 --> 02:09:39,225
In the world?  You helped save
the lives of many Americans.

2074
02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:44,300
What we did in
Hiroshima... in Nagasaki.

2075
02:09:44,450 --> 02:09:49,175
Sure, sure, sure.  Your invention has
allowed us to bring our children home.

2076
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:52,300
It wasn't my invention.

2077
02:09:53,300 --> 02:09:56,300
You are on the cover.

2078
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:01,875
Jim told me you were concerned
about the Soviet arms race.

2079
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:08,165
Yes, it is.  Now we have
a chance to make sure

2080
02:10:08,290 --> 02:10:15,297
International cooperation and
interest in the field of atomic energy.

2081
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:19,387
Did you know when the
Soviets would have the bomb?

2082
02:10:19,850 --> 02:10:25,300
I don't think I can give you...
Never.  Never.  Never.

2083
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:30,175
Mr. President, Russians have
excellent physiques and rich resources.

2084
02:10:30,300 --> 02:10:31,175
Abundance?

2085
02:10:31,300 --> 02:10:32,300
Yes.

2086
02:10:32,700 --> 02:10:34,300
I do not believe.

2087
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:42,275
Well, don't put everything
they've got into it.

2088
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:48,300
I heard you left Los
Atoms.  What should we do?

2089
02:10:58,400 --> 02:10:59,425
Return it to the Indians.

2090
02:10:59,550 --> 02:11:05,675
Dr. Oppenheimer, if what he
says about the Soviets is true.

2091
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:12,300
We have to build Los
Alamos, not close it.

2092
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:24,300
Mr. President, I feel like
I've flattened all my hands.

2093
02:11:43,200 --> 02:11:50,207
Do you think they care who built
the bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki?

2094
02:11:54,950 --> 02:12:01,300
They want to know
who posted it.  I did it.

2095
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:08,857
Hiroshima is not about you.

2096
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:17,707
Doctor Oppenheimer

2097
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:30,607
Don't let crying bring me back.

2098
02:12:31,450 --> 02:12:36,105
Robert saw that the
handshake had captured him.

2099
02:12:36,230 --> 02:12:41,935
out of nowhere, and the moment
I met him, I was fully embraced

2100
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:49,067
his father's fame and used
his profile to influence politics.

2101
02:12:52,300 --> 02:12:54,625
Can you say "Dr."?  In
the years following the war

2102
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:57,175
Did it have a major impact
on US atomic policy?

2103
02:12:57,300 --> 02:12:58,176
I think it's great.

2104
02:12:58,301 --> 02:13:00,175
We know that's what they mean.

2105
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:03,315
Really?  We will ensure that
the isotopes we personally deal

2106
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:06,525
with are not to eliminate any
opposition to their expulsion.

2107
02:13:06,650 --> 02:13:10,175
Can you check out the beer?
You are building atomic weapons.

2108
02:13:10,300 --> 02:13:14,300
I was the speaker, but the opinion
of the scientists was unanimous.

2109
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:18,935
Meanwhile McCarthy was on the rise
because he knew he was vulnerable.

2110
02:13:19,060 --> 02:13:23,300
His brother was blacklisted
from all universities in the country.

2111
02:13:24,050 --> 02:13:28,300
The crewwoman works on
the railway and lays the rails.

2112
02:13:29,150 --> 02:13:32,300
Like Chevalier,
he's gone into exile.

2113
02:13:33,170 --> 02:13:36,945
But all this did not
stop Robert's progress.

2114
02:13:37,070 --> 02:13:41,300
The GAC recommends arms
control instead of the hydrogen bomb.

2115
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:47,175
Truman was shocked
when he rejected their advice.

2116
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:50,175
I miss Richard more
than he can bear.

2117
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:54,300
I'm glad you didn't live to
see what the fuss was about.

2118
02:13:54,500 --> 02:14:00,300
The birthday boy arrives.
Take it off

2119
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:02,175
Have fun with him.

2120
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:05,235
Robert my son and his
girlfriend the most beautiful

2121
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:08,300
words for me the father of
the atomic bomb, that is...

2122
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:19,300
Suspicious.
What do you think, Lewis?

2123
02:14:20,300 --> 02:14:21,775
I guess I had to wrap you up.

2124
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:24,175
in the world.

2125
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:28,300
What does Fukes mean
to the rest of the world?

2126
02:14:29,150 --> 02:14:32,300
Fukes.  Fukes class

2127
02:14:33,650 --> 02:14:36,300
Honey, you didn't hear me.

2128
02:14:37,750 --> 02:14:40,825
The Fukes class.
They are British scientists

2129
02:14:40,950 --> 02:14:44,300
Formed an explosives
team at Los Alamos.

2130
02:14:45,150 --> 02:14:46,551
It turned out that he was…

2131
02:14:47,300 --> 02:14:51,300
... as good as him.
God. I'm sorry.

2132
02:14:53,550 --> 02:15:00,557
When the truth about Fukes emerged,
the FBI increased its surveillance of him.

2133
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:03,734
He knew his phone was tapped.

2134
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:05,325
He fell all over the place.

2135
02:15:05,450 --> 02:15:08,300
Destroyed

2136
02:15:11,670 --> 02:15:14,175
But never stop
saying what you think.

2137
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:16,300
A man of faith.

2138
02:15:16,600 --> 02:15:20,175
And maybe he thought that
fame could really protect him.

2139
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:24,175
Eisenhower had another
chance when he took office.

2140
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:26,300
He took it.

2141
02:15:26,700 --> 02:15:33,175
America and Russia can be
compared to two scorpions in a bottle.

2142
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:40,175
Each can kill the other, but
only at the risk of his own life.

2143
02:15:40,300 --> 02:15:42,175
There are several aspects
of politics about him.

2144
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:46,175
Modern scientists blame
me, but how could I protect it?

2145
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:48,175
Too secret to discuss.

2146
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:50,175
Honesty is the only medicine.

2147
02:15:50,300 --> 02:15:55,175
Washington authorities should start
with the country of American media.

2148
02:15:55,300 --> 02:15:58,367
This is the last straw
for Roberto Sotomayor.

2149
02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:01,175
So he had to lose
his security class.

2150
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:03,175
And with it his reliability.

2151
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:05,175
But how can they do it?

2152
02:16:05,300 --> 02:16:07,175
He was a war hero.

2153
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:09,525
He had already told
everyone about his past.

2154
02:16:09,650 --> 02:16:11,575
He would prefer
not to wet them all.

2155
02:16:11,700 --> 02:16:14,175
How did the Board get access
to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

2156
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:16,275
Could it have been Nichols?

2157
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:18,725
No, I can't imagine that.

2158
02:16:18,850 --> 02:16:22,175
Whoever it was, at least if I was
the storm that burned a person.

2159
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:25,300
From the White House or
from my desk, to the AEC.

2160
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:27,300
You see it there, right?

2161
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:31,267
I've worked all
my life to get here.

2162
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:35,475
Now from all over the country,
Canada and the United States.

2163
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:38,300
They will put me back in my place.

2164
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:40,567
flat shoe salesman.

2165
02:16:41,400 --> 02:16:43,300
Lewis, we can win.

2166
02:16:43,550 --> 02:16:46,175
I think we can take the sun off
the grass, but you did your job.

2167
02:16:46,300 --> 02:16:48,225
It was a bitter bill.

2168
02:16:48,350 --> 02:16:50,175
Will Hill's testimony
prove us right?

2169
02:16:50,300 --> 02:16:51,176
Hill will be fine.

2170
02:16:51,301 --> 02:16:54,225
I don't know him, but he was
their son by Silveridge in Chicago.

2171
02:16:54,350 --> 02:16:59,475
Robert has never been forgiven for failing to
support the petition against the bombing of Japan.

2172
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:03,300
This photo was taken
31 days after the bombing.

2173
02:17:03,950 --> 02:17:08,300
Almost all the inhabitants of
the street for almost a kilometer,

2174
02:17:08,950 --> 02:17:12,300
burned immediately
and violently.

2175
02:17:13,350 --> 02:17:16,985
The Japanese talked
about people wearing stripes.

2176
02:17:17,110 --> 02:17:21,300
clothing in which the
skin is burned in strips.

2177
02:17:21,950 --> 02:17:24,300
Many thought they were lucky

2178
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:29,175
They emerged from the ruins of
their home with only minor injuries.

2179
02:17:29,300 --> 02:17:32,300
But they died anyway.

2180
02:17:32,700 --> 02:17:35,567
They died after a
few days or weeks,

2181
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,611
due to the rithium-like
rays contained within it a

2182
02:17:38,736 --> 02:17:41,670
large amount emitted at
the time of the explosion.

2183
02:17:42,550 --> 02:17:44,525
Did you read that
link in the newspaper?

2184
02:17:44,650 --> 02:17:47,065
British physicists worked

2185
02:17:47,190 --> 02:17:49,345
It was not the final
act of WWII, but

2186
02:17:49,470 --> 02:17:52,470
the first act of this
cold war with Russia.

2187
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:54,176
which physique?

2188
02:17:54,301 --> 02:17:57,300
I think you know him.
Patrick Blackett.

2189
02:17:59,970 --> 02:18:02,455
He may not be wrong.
Stimson is telling me that

2190
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:05,175
They chained the
essentially defeated enemy.

2191
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:08,300
Robert, you now
have all the influence.

2192
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:13,375
Please encourage them
to continue my super quest.

2193
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:15,375
Anything can and
will happen, Edward.

2194
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:18,967
Why?  It's not a good
use of our resources.

2195
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:20,520
Do you really believe it?

2196
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:25,300
Wow, Robert Oppenheimer,
the sphinx, your atomic guru.

2197
02:18:26,250 --> 02:18:28,300
Nobody knows what you believe.

2198
02:18:29,300 --> 02:18:30,300
Six

2199
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:36,175
Once again our Program Director
is Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2200
02:18:36,300 --> 02:18:42,300
I hope he has arrived and that we
here will look at your work with pride.

2201
02:18:43,250 --> 02:18:47,300
Today, however, this pride must
be tempered by deep concern.

2202
02:18:49,450 --> 02:18:53,650
If atomic weapons are to be added
to the arsenal of the warring world,

2203
02:18:54,450 --> 02:18:58,300
then the day will come when people
will curse the name of Los Alamos.

2204
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:04,300
I'm sorry I was wrong.

2205
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:06,175
Wait, forget it.

2206
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:08,300
Seems auspicious.

2207
02:19:09,550 --> 02:19:11,575
Here is Oppenheimer.
What's the title?

2208
02:19:11,700 --> 02:19:14,300
J. Robert Oppenheimer, Hayfight.

2209
02:19:16,850 --> 02:19:18,300
And the United States won.

2210
02:19:19,250 --> 02:19:20,300
This will work

2211
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:22,475
Those were your
words the other day.

2212
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:24,325
We had to go back.

2213
02:19:24,450 --> 02:19:26,575
But how do you know what
Time magazine will write?

2214
02:19:26,700 --> 02:19:28,225
Henry Luce was a friend.

2215
02:19:28,350 --> 02:19:35,357
Sit here and I'll tell
you how it's done.

2216
02:19:39,720 --> 02:19:42,120
But you were always in front.

2217
02:19:42,250 --> 02:19:43,176
Survival in Washington.

2218
02:19:43,301 --> 02:19:46,175
I still wanted to know
how to do something.

2219
02:19:46,300 --> 02:19:48,300
Exact.

2220
02:19:50,900 --> 02:19:52,176
What did you say about Borden?

2221
02:19:52,301 --> 02:19:55,102
Why were you caught
with a knife in your hand?

2222
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:59,175
I found out that Borden
keeps a knife for you.

2223
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:06,175
Depends on how much
effect Borden can have.

2224
02:20:06,300 --> 02:20:07,700
Tell him

2225
02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:09,325
Did I say something funny?

2226
02:20:09,450 --> 02:20:13,225
Borden, Borden, Borden.  When
we all know they are made of straw.

2227
02:20:13,350 --> 02:20:16,195
It probably appears
in the princely state.

2228
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:19,175
And then you acknowledge
it before Congress.

2229
02:20:19,300 --> 02:20:21,175
But more useful than the center.

2230
02:20:21,300 --> 02:20:27,175
How many?

2231
02:20:27,300 --> 02:20:29,300
Maybe it's too good, Robert.

2232
02:20:29,550 --> 02:20:31,225
That was six years ago.

2233
02:20:31,350 --> 02:20:33,175
You know, they're
really vindictive.

2234
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:34,300
Patiently saying that it is…

2235
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:37,225
It was pretty obvious to
Slamka that he was neutral.

2236
02:20:37,350 --> 02:20:41,175
Wakes up!  This is trash!

2237
02:20:41,300 --> 02:20:43,500
It's always been
straw and you know it!

2238
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:45,800
Wake up, you will
have to fight him.

2239
02:20:48,750 --> 02:20:53,550
It wasn't Nichols or Hoover,
one of Truman's men.  It was you.

2240
02:20:53,950 --> 02:20:56,555
You gave the file to
Borden and you uploaded it.

2241
02:20:56,680 --> 02:20:59,375
Oppenheimer.
You convinced him... Borden!

2242
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:01,300
He didn't give me
anything convincing.

2243
02:21:01,950 --> 02:21:03,675
Don't rush to
use the whole file.

2244
02:21:03,800 --> 02:21:06,175
Write your results.
Send them to the FBI.

2245
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:10,300
Of course the material is very
extensive, but there is nothing new.

2246
02:21:10,700 --> 02:21:12,367
Your results will be listed.

2247
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:14,925
And it will be necessary to answer.

2248
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:16,895
Hoover will pass
them on to McCarthy.

2249
02:21:17,020 --> 02:21:19,175
Oppenheimer is too slimy
for the compliant clown.

2250
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:21,905
I talked to Hoover about it.
Hold McCarthy.

2251
02:21:22,030 --> 02:21:24,175
He is in contact with the AEC.

2252
02:21:24,300 --> 02:21:25,176
A test

2253
02:21:25,301 --> 02:21:27,527
Negative.  There is no
court.  It cannot be given

2254
02:21:27,652 --> 02:21:31,300
Oppenheimer.
You can't torture him.

2255
02:21:32,300 --> 02:21:35,195
We must systematically
destroy Oppenheimer's credibility.

2256
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:38,175
and we will never again talk
about matters of national security.

2257
02:21:38,300 --> 02:21:41,300
And then?

2258
02:21:42,450 --> 02:21:45,300
We will shut you down.
Out of the spotlight.

2259
02:21:45,870 --> 02:21:52,877
A simple bureaucratic procedure
has a nice approval.  To be healed.

2260
02:21:55,300 --> 02:21:59,300
Submit your allegations to the FBI.

2261
02:21:59,800 --> 02:22:04,300
Hoover will send them to the AEC.
You have to move.

2262
02:22:04,850 --> 02:22:06,300
You are writing an indictment.

2263
02:22:06,650 --> 02:22:10,475
But tell Oppenheimer his security
clearance doesn't need to be renewed.

2264
02:22:10,600 --> 02:22:12,325
However, give him
a chance to object.

2265
02:22:12,450 --> 02:22:15,175
As you can see, Robert, it hasn't
been signed yet.  Can I keep it?

2266
02:22:15,300 --> 02:22:16,700
NO

2267
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:20,175
If you decide to object,
do not include it in the copy.

2268
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:25,175
When you object and trust me, I
will appoint a board of directors.

2269
02:22:25,300 --> 02:22:28,225
Of course they will count.

2270
02:22:28,350 --> 02:22:30,175
prosecutor

2271
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:31,175
Name and surname

2272
02:22:31,300 --> 02:22:32,175
WEAVING?

2273
02:22:32,300 --> 02:22:33,275
RogerRob

2274
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:37,175
Oh.  Oh.  Rob will have security
clearance to review Oppenheimer's file.

2275
02:22:37,300 --> 02:22:40,300
Just like great advice.
There won't be a defense attorney.

2276
02:22:42,070 --> 02:22:46,225
The closed case concerns the so-called defamatory
information contained in your accusation.

2277
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:51,300
No public, no journalists,
no burden of proof.

2278
02:22:51,500 --> 02:22:53,275
No burden of proof.

2279
02:22:53,400 --> 02:22:56,300
We are not prisoners.

2280
02:22:57,450 --> 02:22:59,300
Eye of Len

2281
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:06,300
What did you say?

2282
02:23:07,550 --> 02:23:10,300
That's how it's played.

2283
02:23:11,300 --> 02:23:13,275
Forgive my naivety.

2284
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:18,300
Amateurs seek
the sun, let's eat.

2285
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:21,300
Power remains in the shadows.

2286
02:23:21,950 --> 02:23:24,300
But, sir, you are now
out of the shadows.

2287
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:26,587
Yes, that's why it should work.

2288
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:31,175
Tell him you
resigned this morning.

2289
02:23:31,300 --> 02:23:32,275
This will help you.

2290
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:35,300
And then Hill in the afternoon.

2291
02:23:35,550 --> 02:23:37,300
Hill will help us.

2292
02:23:39,170 --> 02:23:42,175
As you can see, Robert, the
situation is not on your side.

2293
02:23:42,300 --> 02:23:43,300
Can I keep it?

2294
02:23:43,450 --> 02:23:45,300
NO

2295
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:52,300
If you decide to appeal,
they'll need to send you a copy.

2296
02:23:53,570 --> 02:23:58,225
Take my current
chauffeur, sister.

2297
02:23:58,350 --> 02:24:04,175
I won't sell my
lawyers for this.

2298
02:24:04,300 --> 02:24:05,700
Of course not.

2299
02:24:06,020 --> 02:24:07,176
But don't take too long.

2300
02:24:07,301 --> 02:24:09,368
I can't keep Nichols for a day.

2301
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:16,807
I'm sorry it has
come to this, Robert.

2302
02:24:17,300 --> 02:24:19,300
I think this is wrong.

2303
02:24:32,300 --> 02:24:35,175
Nichols wants you to find him
so he can record everything.

2304
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:37,225
Stross wants me to leave.

2305
02:24:37,350 --> 02:24:40,175
Stross knows he can't do it.

2306
02:24:40,300 --> 02:24:43,175
He was about to plead
guilty to the charges.

2307
02:24:43,300 --> 02:24:44,176
you will lose your job.

2308
02:24:44,301 --> 02:24:46,175
You will lose your reputation.

2309
02:24:46,300 --> 02:24:47,176
We will lose the house!

2310
02:24:47,301 --> 02:24:49,300
Robert, we have to fight.

2311
02:24:53,150 --> 02:24:55,484
I cannot represent you
as the Council of the EC.

2312
02:24:55,700 --> 02:24:56,176
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

2313
02:24:56,301 --> 02:24:58,300
He has the best.

2314
02:24:58,500 --> 02:25:01,300
But I have to warn you.

2315
02:25:03,450 --> 02:25:04,984
It won't be a fair fight.

2316
02:25:05,150 --> 02:25:09,175
Did you mention microfilm in your
interview with Boris Paš in 1943?

2317
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:10,175
NO

2318
02:25:10,300 --> 02:25:11,175
Touch 11.

2319
02:25:11,300 --> 02:25:12,176
Thanks for my paragraph.

2320
02:25:12,301 --> 02:25:16,175
You never said the man at the
consulate is an expert in using microfilm?

2321
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:17,176
I am sorry.  I am sorry.
I am sorry.  I am sorry.

2322
02:25:17,301 --> 02:25:19,025
I'd like to know it,

2323
02:25:19,150 --> 02:25:21,275
What document does
Mr. Robb and can we get a copy?

2324
02:25:21,400 --> 02:25:23,175
The document is
confidential, Mr. Garrison.

2325
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:25,175
I think we should go back
to first hand information.

2326
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:26,300
First hand

2327
02:25:26,550 --> 02:25:28,300
Is it me Roger?

2328
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:32,175
Recorded interview.

2329
02:25:32,300 --> 02:25:37,325
My client is sitting here
potentially lying to himself.

2330
02:25:37,450 --> 02:25:42,175
And all this time
you had a precedent?

2331
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:45,395
Nobody told your client to
twist his previous answer.

2332
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:48,175
It happened 12 years ago.
Can we listen to this recording?

2333
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:50,175
You're not allowed,
Mr. Garrison.

2334
02:25:50,300 --> 02:25:52,245
You have made a small pre-cut.

2335
02:25:52,370 --> 02:25:56,370
Please please please.  Is this
case about prison or the truth?

2336
02:25:56,950 --> 02:26:00,175
If this is true, where is the statement?
Where's the witness list?

2337
02:26:00,300 --> 02:26:02,755
Mr. Garris, this is
not a trial because you

2338
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:05,175
know very well.  Trial
rules do not apply.

2339
02:26:05,300 --> 02:26:07,175
We are dealing
with national security.

2340
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:11,145
Yes, sir.  With all due respect, I don't
understand what national security is.

2341
02:26:11,270 --> 02:26:15,175
prevents the prosecution from
providing us with the witness list.

2342
02:26:15,300 --> 02:26:17,175
Joanne, you know my words.

2343
02:26:17,300 --> 02:26:20,295
Either it's in the transcript
or it's not accepted.

2344
02:26:20,420 --> 02:26:23,225
I already explained how I
created a story filled with Recocan.

2345
02:26:23,350 --> 02:26:26,225
So why would anyone make
up such an elaborate story?

2346
02:26:26,350 --> 02:26:28,300
Because I was an idiot.

2347
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:30,300
Why lie?

2348
02:26:30,450 --> 02:26:34,300
Obviously with the intention of not
revealing who your intermediary is.

2349
02:26:34,770 --> 02:26:37,625
Your friend, Paquon
Chanaali, is a commissioner.

2350
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:39,325
Is he still your boyfriend?

2351
02:26:39,450 --> 02:26:41,300
Yes.

2352
02:26:42,970 --> 02:26:45,175
Dr. Rami, thank you for coming.

2353
02:26:45,300 --> 02:26:47,245
How did the accusation come about?

2354
02:26:47,370 --> 02:26:52,175
Tell them they passed the law.

2355
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:53,176
What did he say?

2356
02:26:53,301 --> 02:26:55,275
He didn't come down to them.

2357
02:26:55,400 --> 02:26:58,435
But Frost told him that
you and Ruth Dohmen

2358
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:01,300
have been in a
relationship for years.

2359
02:27:01,950 --> 02:27:04,315
He was persuasive the entire
time he watched them in Pasadena.

2360
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:07,175
Lawrence said Richard
died of a broken heart.

2361
02:27:07,300 --> 02:27:09,175
Mr. Surd, what
kind of heart is this?

2362
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:11,300
Broken heart

2363
02:27:11,700 --> 02:27:13,767
Richard never learned.

2364
02:27:14,100 --> 02:27:15,634
as long as he proves it.

2365
02:27:15,900 --> 02:27:17,300
I do not know

2366
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:22,175
Dr. Rabbi, what government
positions does he currently hold?

2367
02:27:22,300 --> 02:27:24,865
I am the Chairman of the
General Advisory Council.

2368
02:27:24,990 --> 02:27:28,175
I am a member of the EIC
committee and I am Dr. Oppenheimer.

2369
02:27:28,300 --> 02:27:30,967
How long have you
known Oppenheimer?

2370
02:27:31,150 --> 02:27:35,175
I have known him
very well since 1928.

2371
02:27:35,300 --> 02:27:39,300
Well enough to speak of
her loyalty and his character.

2372
02:27:39,450 --> 02:27:43,300
Dr. Oppenheimer is a
man of honorable character.

2373
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:46,645
And it is loyal to the
United States of America.

2374
02:27:46,770 --> 02:27:50,300
friends, institutions
that are part of.

2375
02:27:51,450 --> 02:27:52,850
Eat food

2376
02:27:58,100 --> 02:28:05,107
who's this?

2377
02:28:12,350 --> 02:28:13,176
There is nothing
to be afraid of.

2378
02:28:13,301 --> 02:28:17,365
After the Russian
atomic bomb test

2379
02:28:17,490 --> 02:28:21,300
Lawrence turned to you
about the hydrogen bomb.

2380
02:28:21,900 --> 02:28:23,275
You'd better ask him.

2381
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:24,175
What's up?

2382
02:28:24,300 --> 02:28:25,300
What will you buy?

2383
02:28:25,450 --> 02:28:29,175
Was Dr. Oppenheimer always
against the hydrogen bomb?

2384
02:28:29,300 --> 02:28:32,235
No, he was thinking about the
future of the merger program.

2385
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:35,275
at the expense of our
low-quality fission program.

2386
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:37,375
But it turned out
that was not the case.

2387
02:28:37,500 --> 02:28:39,875
In case you can do both.

2388
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:43,045
Suppose this counsel doesn't feel
the sense of fulfillment it does have.

2389
02:28:43,170 --> 02:28:46,370
testimony here, Dr. Oppenheimer
was absolutely right.

2390
02:28:46,750 --> 02:28:48,175
Should he be clean or not?

2391
02:28:48,300 --> 02:28:50,585
Why are you doing
all this against a man?

2392
02:28:50,710 --> 02:28:53,175
The Dr proved it with his
own hands.  Openheimer

2393
02:28:53,300 --> 02:28:54,834
Check your card.

2394
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:57,275
We have the atomic
bomb and the whole series.

2395
02:28:57,400 --> 02:28:58,225
We have the whole
series of superbombs.

2396
02:28:58,350 --> 02:29:00,175
More of what you want

2397
02:29:00,300 --> 02:29:01,700
My friends

2398
02:29:02,450 --> 02:29:05,305
But I've known
Minister Stoltz for years.

2399
02:29:05,430 --> 02:29:08,175
I feel the need to express
my warm support to him.

2400
02:29:08,300 --> 02:29:11,175
Louis de Chon for
science and scientists.

2401
02:29:11,300 --> 02:29:13,845
But right now, if
there's nothing...

2402
02:29:13,970 --> 02:29:17,275
Senator, I'd like to ask again.

2403
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:20,300
we have a list of witnesses.

2404
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:22,465
And I remind the
candidate that you are not.

2405
02:29:22,590 --> 02:29:24,175
always have this
information in advance.

2406
02:29:24,300 --> 02:29:27,300
Dr. Hill will be
here after lunch.

2407
02:29:27,550 --> 02:29:29,955
Mr. President, the
next scheduled witness,

2408
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:33,300
Dr. Lawrence, it
appears to be colitis.

2409
02:29:36,450 --> 02:29:39,245
We'll go with William
Borden instead.

2410
02:29:39,370 --> 02:29:43,300
Mr. Borden, please have a seat.

2411
02:29:44,700 --> 02:29:47,585
Mr. Borden, when he
learned of the investigation...

2412
02:29:47,710 --> 02:29:51,175
Dr. Oppenheimer, have
you come to any conclusions?

2413
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:52,300
I did it

2414
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:55,345
The time has come to
express these conclusions.

2415
02:29:55,470 --> 02:29:58,175
Letter from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation to Mr. J. Gopover?

2416
02:29:58,300 --> 02:29:59,300
That's right

2417
02:29:59,500 --> 02:30:01,785
You discussed writing
the letter before writing it

2418
02:30:01,910 --> 02:30:04,175
A letter with someone from
the Atomic Energy Commission?

2419
02:30:04,300 --> 02:30:06,175
I will not do that

2420
02:30:06,300 --> 02:30:08,625
You actually remembered that
letter when I was in front of you.

2421
02:30:08,750 --> 02:30:11,775
If so, could you
be very nice to me?

2422
02:30:11,900 --> 02:30:14,295
Dear Mr. Hoover, The
purpose of this letter...

2423
02:30:14,420 --> 02:30:16,225
I'm sorry, I'd
apologize if I could...

2424
02:30:16,350 --> 02:30:20,300
What is the purpose of the delay?
You just have to read the letter.

2425
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:23,534
Mr President, this is the
first letter I have seen.

2426
02:30:24,100 --> 02:30:26,595
And here I see at least one
declaration of the type you speak of.

2427
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:29,175
I don't think anyone
wants it on the record.

2428
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:31,575
These are allegations
that did not exist before.

2429
02:30:31,700 --> 02:30:34,325
which have come to light and
were not part of Nichols' prosecution.

2430
02:30:34,450 --> 02:30:37,175
These are allegations that I
do not believe belong here.

2431
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:39,055
The witness wrote this
initiative letter of him presented

2432
02:30:39,180 --> 02:30:41,225
evidence that had already been
presented to the commission.

2433
02:30:41,350 --> 02:30:44,145
His conclusions are a
valid and positive testimony.

2434
02:30:44,270 --> 02:30:47,825
the results of his friends, Dr. Oppenheimer.
It is a statement that applies to both parties.

2435
02:30:47,950 --> 02:30:50,175
How long has the consultant
been holding this letter?

2436
02:30:50,300 --> 02:30:51,974
I don't think I need
to be subjugated.

2437
02:30:52,099 --> 02:30:54,495
cross-examination
by him, Mr. Garrison.

2438
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:56,955
Mr. Garrison, since we're
on the board of directors

2439
02:30:57,080 --> 02:30:59,975
They read the letter, wouldn't it
be better to put it in the minutes?

2440
02:31:00,100 --> 02:31:01,500
Go on.

2441
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:08,645
Dear Mr. Hoover, The purpose of this letter
is to express my views based on the following:

2442
02:31:08,770 --> 02:31:12,175
long-term study of the
available categorized

2443
02:31:12,300 --> 02:31:15,335
evidence, it is very
likely that J. Robert

2444
02:31:15,460 --> 02:31:19,175
Oppenheimer is an
agent of the Soviet Union.

2445
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:22,175
The following
conclusions are justified.

2446
02:31:22,300 --> 02:31:24,550
One, from 1929 to 1942, with the

2447
02:31:24,675 --> 02:31:27,175
most most likely, J.
Robert Oppenheimer

2448
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:32,175
A communist staunch enough
to feed the Soviets information.

2449
02:31:32,300 --> 02:31:38,175
Second, it's more likely that he's been
working as an espionage agent ever since.

2450
02:31:38,300 --> 02:31:42,445
After the third, most
likely, he moved on.

2451
02:31:42,570 --> 02:31:47,175
Soviet directive affecting
US military policy.

2452
02:31:47,300 --> 02:31:48,300
Sorry Robert.

2453
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:54,175
Does anyone want to tell the
truth about what's going on here?

2454
02:31:54,300 --> 02:31:57,175
We will now hear
from Dr. David's Hill.

2455
02:31:57,300 --> 02:32:04,307
Dr. Hill, does he want
to make a statement?

2456
02:32:10,300 --> 02:32:13,300
Okay thanks.

2457
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:18,125
I've been asked to
testify about Louis Straws.

2458
02:32:18,250 --> 02:32:22,225
he held high-level government
positions for many years.

2459
02:32:22,350 --> 02:32:28,300
and is known for his seriousness,
industriousness and intelligence.

2460
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:32,735
The opinions I have to
express are my own, but

2461
02:32:32,860 --> 02:32:36,625
I think much of what I
say will help indicate that.

2462
02:32:36,750 --> 02:32:40,215
why most of the
scientists in this country

2463
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:44,175
He preferred that Mr.  Slamek was
completely alien to the government.

2464
02:32:44,300 --> 02:32:47,775
You mean the hostility of some

2465
02:32:47,900 --> 02:32:50,755
Scientists directed to Mr.
straws

2466
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:57,300
Because of his commitment to security,
as demonstrated in the Oppenheimer case?

2467
02:32:58,600 --> 02:33:05,607
Negative.  Because of his personal
grudge against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2468
02:33:06,300 --> 02:33:09,175
Book!  Book!

2469
02:33:09,300 --> 02:33:15,465
It seems that most of the scientists in
this country are Robert Oppenheimer.

2470
02:33:15,590 --> 02:33:22,195
He has been washed and tested for
expressing his honest opinions of him.

2471
02:33:22,320 --> 02:33:23,995
Dr. Bush, I thought
I was performing.

2472
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:26,175
Service to my country
when I approached this case.

2473
02:33:26,300 --> 02:33:29,565
No parliament should
judge in this country

2474
02:33:29,690 --> 02:33:33,275
because it has expressed
the strong views of him.

2475
02:33:33,400 --> 02:33:37,065
If you want to try this
case, you should try me.

2476
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:41,175
Friends, forgive me if
I'm angry, but I'm upset.

2477
02:33:41,300 --> 02:33:45,175
Dr. Hill, we have already learned
that Mr. Straws will not sue.

2478
02:33:45,300 --> 02:33:49,175
He didn't even attend the
hearings against Dr. Oppenheimer

2479
02:33:49,300 --> 02:33:52,535
The Oppenheimer affair was
initiated and accomplished

2480
02:33:52,660 --> 02:33:56,300
largely through the
hostility of Louis Straws.

2481
02:33:56,700 --> 02:34:01,305
Oppenheimer got the men talking
about Straws' attitude towards shipping.

2482
02:34:01,430 --> 02:34:06,300
Norway and isotopes a Straws never
forgave him this public humiliation.

2483
02:34:07,300 --> 02:34:10,105
Another discussion between the
two centered around their differences.

2484
02:34:10,230 --> 02:34:13,175
in deciding how the elderly
contribute to national security.

2485
02:34:13,300 --> 02:34:16,075
The straws turned it into
a personal security system,

2486
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:19,175
To destroy Oppenheimer's
effectiveness.

2487
02:34:19,300 --> 02:34:21,033
And Straws managed to find a

2488
02:34:21,158 --> 02:34:23,575
couple ambitious
men who disagree

2489
02:34:23,700 --> 02:34:28,175
He was jealous of Oppenheimer's behavior
and prestige in government circles.

2490
02:34:28,300 --> 02:34:31,071
I always thought
and still think that he

2491
02:34:31,196 --> 02:34:33,330
is loyal to the United
States of America.

2492
02:34:33,900 --> 02:34:38,425
I believe it and I will leave it until I
see the truth that is convincing for others.

2493
02:34:38,550 --> 02:34:43,417
Believe it or not, is
Dr. Oppenheimer a security risk?

2494
02:34:46,150 --> 02:34:49,095
In many cases that I have seen,
Dr. Oppenheimer will intervene.

2495
02:34:49,220 --> 02:34:52,687
in a way that is extremely
difficult for me to understand.

2496
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:55,655
I completely disagree with him
on many points and I disagree with

2497
02:34:55,780 --> 02:34:58,895
him the actions honestly seem
confusing and complicated to me.

2498
02:34:59,020 --> 02:35:02,905
At this point, I feel like I want
to see the life interests of this.

2499
02:35:03,030 --> 02:35:07,497
I understand the countries in their
hands better and therefore trust them more.

2500
02:35:08,750 --> 02:35:10,300
Thank you sir.  Well thank you.

2501
02:35:14,300 --> 02:35:15,176
I am sorry

2502
02:35:15,301 --> 02:35:19,175
Did you shake his hand?

2503
02:35:19,300 --> 02:35:22,175
I could have spit in his face.

2504
02:35:22,300 --> 02:35:24,475
I'm not sure the border
will appreciate that.

2505
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:26,955
Isn't he nice enough for you?

2506
02:35:27,080 --> 02:35:29,225
You are all very nice gentlemen.

2507
02:35:29,350 --> 02:35:33,175
Gray needs to see what Rob is
doing.  Why doesn't he stop him?

2508
02:35:33,300 --> 02:35:35,300
And are you shaking
the towers again?

2509
02:35:36,900 --> 02:35:39,300
You have to stop being a martyr.

2510
02:35:40,500 --> 02:35:45,367
Under current AEC guidelines,
does Dr. Oppenheimer check?

2511
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:55,815
According to my interpretation
of the Atomic Energy Act,

2512
02:35:55,940 --> 02:36:00,300
Not when I hired Dr. It's open,

2513
02:36:01,800 --> 02:36:07,300
If I was on the committee, I
wouldn't have checked it today.

2514
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:09,875
Sure sure.  Thanks, General.
That's all.  But I don't think so

2515
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:13,334
I wouldn't exonerate any
of these men, that's all.

2516
02:36:15,650 --> 02:36:17,695
Dr. Oppenheimer
bore no responsibility.

2517
02:36:17,820 --> 02:36:20,175
selection or selection of the
opinions of the class, right?

2518
02:36:20,300 --> 02:36:21,700
Negative There is none

2519
02:36:21,950 --> 02:36:23,930
And you don't want
to leave this forum

2520
02:36:24,055 --> 02:36:25,425
today without a
questioning suggestion

2521
02:36:25,550 --> 02:36:27,435
His fundamental allegiance
to the United States of America

2522
02:36:27,560 --> 02:36:29,275
State-run Los Alamos?

2523
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:34,734
It is not possible.  I hope I haven't
convinced anyone otherwise for a moment.

2524
02:36:35,450 --> 02:36:37,300
Thanks General.

2525
02:36:41,950 --> 02:36:48,957
You shouldn't keep them waiting.

2526
02:36:56,300 --> 02:36:57,176
Will arrive.

2527
02:36:57,301 --> 02:36:59,300
Do you want it here?

2528
02:37:04,850 --> 02:37:06,945
A fool or a teenager would
dare to acknowledge it.

2529
02:37:07,070 --> 02:37:10,004
someone else's relationship?
And you don't have a lawyer.

2530
02:37:10,300 --> 02:37:16,300
Kitty and I are adults.  We went through
fire together.  It will all be fine.

2531
02:37:17,650 --> 02:37:21,450
Would you describe your view
on communism as pro-neutrality?

2532
02:37:22,900 --> 02:37:27,300
against the Communists.  I have
nothing to do with communism since 1936.

2533
02:37:28,300 --> 02:37:30,175
Since I met Robert.

2534
02:37:30,300 --> 02:37:32,300
That's all

2535
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:36,685
The record shows that he
did not question Oppenheimer.

2536
02:37:36,810 --> 02:37:39,175
A neutral and impartial
adviser to the Gray Board.

2537
02:37:39,300 --> 02:37:42,105
The prosecutor who used
all of them was questioned

2538
02:37:42,230 --> 02:37:45,225
tricks of a rather
sophisticated legal education.

2539
02:37:45,350 --> 02:37:49,300
Now that the gray council has authorized
the prosecution, you are charging.

2540
02:37:50,120 --> 02:37:53,475
If I were on the gray
board, I would protest.

2541
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:57,175
the tactics of a man who
really was a prosecutor.

2542
02:37:57,300 --> 02:38:01,300
A man nominated by Louis
Straus, not the Council.

2543
02:38:04,400 --> 02:38:05,176
who was he?

2544
02:38:05,301 --> 02:38:07,175
How come?

2545
02:38:07,300 --> 02:38:09,300
who was?

2546
02:38:10,350 --> 02:38:11,750
Roger Roberts

2547
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:13,600
Mrs. Oppenheimer.

2548
02:38:18,050 --> 02:38:20,175
Did he have a Communist
Party membership card?

2549
02:38:20,300 --> 02:38:23,175
I'm... I'm not sure.

2550
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:24,175
I'm not sure

2551
02:38:24,300 --> 02:38:25,700
Naturally.

2552
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:31,300
Certain?

2553
02:38:32,750 --> 02:38:39,455
I think the act of joining
the party probably

2554
02:38:39,580 --> 02:38:46,587
required sending money
and receiving postcards, right?

2555
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:51,300
Yes.

2556
02:38:54,300 --> 02:38:59,175
I am sorry

2557
02:38:59,300 --> 02:39:01,175
Yes?

2558
02:39:01,300 --> 02:39:06,175
That was a long time ago.

2559
02:39:06,300 --> 02:39:08,175
Mr. Robert couldn't make
it long enough to forget it.

2560
02:39:08,300 --> 02:39:09,175
Not exactly.

2561
02:39:09,300 --> 02:39:10,325
Do you return the
ticket or tear it up?

2562
02:39:10,450 --> 02:39:12,225
A card I had forgotten existed.

2563
02:39:12,350 --> 02:39:13,225
Communist Party membership card.

2564
02:39:13,350 --> 02:39:15,300
I have not the foggiest idea.

2565
02:39:18,650 --> 02:39:22,450
Is it possible to distinguish between
Soviet communism and communism?

2566
02:39:23,550 --> 02:39:25,475
When I was a member I thought
there were definitely two things.

2567
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:27,825
I was thinking about the
United Communist Party.

2568
02:39:27,950 --> 02:39:30,225
The state takes care
of our internal problems.

2569
02:39:30,350 --> 02:39:32,300
Now I don't believe it anymore.

2570
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,175
Everything is interconnected
and spread throughout the world.

2571
02:39:35,300 --> 02:39:37,175
And I believe it
since I left the party.

2572
02:39:37,300 --> 02:39:39,175
Sixteen years ago.

2573
02:39:39,300 --> 02:39:40,175
Seventeen years ago.

2574
02:39:40,300 --> 02:39:41,176
my fault

2575
02:39:41,301 --> 02:39:43,175
But you... Sorry, eighteen.

2576
02:39:43,300 --> 02:39:46,300
18 years ago.

2577
02:39:47,950 --> 02:39:49,355
You realize your
husband is contributing.

2578
02:39:49,480 --> 02:39:51,175
To the last national anthem
of the Spanish Civil War?

2579
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:53,175
The last civil war since 1942.

2580
02:39:53,300 --> 02:39:55,295
I knew Robert donated
money from time to time.

2581
02:39:55,420 --> 02:39:58,175
Did you know that this money
goes to Communist Party channels?

2582
02:39:58,300 --> 02:39:59,175
Do not you think?

2583
02:39:59,300 --> 02:40:00,176
Excuse me?

2584
02:40:00,301 --> 02:40:03,175
This means through the channels
of the Communist Party, right?

2585
02:40:03,300 --> 02:40:06,245
Yes.

2586
02:40:06,370 --> 02:40:09,545
Then I don't think this
is the same thing the

2587
02:40:09,670 --> 02:40:13,470
husband has nothing to do
with the communist party?

2588
02:40:13,800 --> 02:40:16,475
You don't have to answer yes or no.
You can answer however you want.

2589
02:40:16,600 --> 02:40:18,275
I know thanks.

2590
02:40:18,400 --> 02:40:21,175
This is your problem.
It is not expressed correctly.

2591
02:40:21,300 --> 02:40:22,275
Do you understand what I mean?

2592
02:40:22,400 --> 02:40:23,175
Yes.

2593
02:40:23,300 --> 02:40:24,176
Why do not you answer?

2594
02:40:24,301 --> 02:40:27,535
Because I don't like your statement
that it has to do with communism.

2595
02:40:27,660 --> 02:40:29,246
Except that Robert
never had anything.

2596
02:40:29,371 --> 02:40:31,525
In collaboration with
the Communist Party.

2597
02:40:31,650 --> 02:40:34,405
I know you gave money to
Spanish refugees.  I know.

2598
02:40:34,530 --> 02:40:37,175
intellectually interested
in communist ideas.

2599
02:40:37,300 --> 02:40:39,475
Two types of
communists. Ordinary

2600
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:42,467
intellectuals and communists.

2601
02:40:42,700 --> 02:40:45,275
Here's what I couldn't answer.

2602
02:40:45,400 --> 02:40:47,300
I didn't succeed either.

2603
02:40:49,550 --> 02:40:55,345
Robert, you can't win.
This is a kangaroo court.

2604
02:40:55,470 --> 02:41:01,300
predetermined result I
exposed myself more.

2605
02:41:01,900 --> 02:41:03,301
I had my reasons

2606
02:41:04,850 --> 02:41:11,857
He's right about one thing.

2607
02:41:13,850 --> 02:41:16,175
I'm not sure you
understand, Albert.

2608
02:41:16,300 --> 02:41:17,700
NO.

2609
02:41:18,350 --> 02:41:21,675
I left my country and
never spoke to him.

2610
02:41:21,800 --> 02:41:24,000
You have served
your country well.

2611
02:41:24,200 --> 02:41:29,334
If this is the reward he's offering you,
maybe you should turn your back on him.

2612
02:41:29,550 --> 02:41:32,175
Oh shit.  Shit.  I was
not out of this country.

2613
02:41:32,300 --> 02:41:35,300
Then tell him to go to hell.

2614
02:41:36,550 --> 02:41:41,525
Interesting, Leon.  No more
briefing hearings.  This is a process.

2615
02:41:41,650 --> 02:41:43,300
About the hearing?

2616
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:47,175
He doesn't want to tell everyone
that you initiated the hearings.

2617
02:41:47,300 --> 02:41:50,610
Nothing can prove it.

2618
02:41:53,600 --> 02:41:56,225
We are not in court sir,
there is no burden of proof.

2619
02:41:56,350 --> 02:41:58,300
It is true.  They are not prisoners.

2620
02:41:59,750 --> 02:42:04,275
Just deny it.  Why did he come
here to destroy me?  What's the goal?

2621
02:42:04,400 --> 02:42:07,175
Do people need a reason to
do the right thing in their opinion?

2622
02:42:07,300 --> 02:42:09,935
I told you.
Up and down the courthouse

2623
02:42:10,060 --> 02:42:13,175
He blamed me
from the first call.

2624
02:42:13,300 --> 02:42:19,300
I don't know, but Oppenheimer said it
would be the last time I would see him.

2625
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:23,175
Oppenheimer knows
how to manipulate him.

2626
02:42:23,300 --> 02:42:26,435
He straightens his elbows.  He prayed
that night while you were a scholar.

2627
02:42:26,560 --> 02:42:29,525
they thought they could
understand how he used his work.

2628
02:42:29,650 --> 02:42:32,325
They will never think
that he is so naive.

2629
02:42:32,450 --> 02:42:38,300
Doctor, during your work
on the hydrogen bomb,

2630
02:42:39,550 --> 02:42:42,675
Yes, certainly.  But he kept
working anyway, didn't he?

2631
02:42:42,800 --> 02:42:46,175
Yes, because it was worth
exploring and not preparing a weapon.

2632
02:42:46,300 --> 02:42:48,175
Are you saying it was more
of an academic field trip?

2633
02:42:48,300 --> 02:42:50,625
No, it wasn't an academic
thing.  The point is, you could have

2634
02:42:50,750 --> 02:42:53,175
built a hydrogen bomb.  It
was a matter of life and death.

2635
02:42:53,300 --> 02:42:56,375
Until 1942 you actively supported
the development of the hydrogen bomb.

2636
02:42:56,500 --> 02:42:58,175
Did you print what
I was working on?

2637
02:42:58,300 --> 02:43:00,375
Support and work on it.  Yes.

2638
02:43:00,500 --> 02:43:02,745
When did these moral
doubts get so strong?

2639
02:43:02,870 --> 02:43:05,395
did you actively oppose the
development of the hydrogen bomb?

2640
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:07,835
When was the US policy proposed?

2641
02:43:07,960 --> 02:43:10,325
The state must do
these things at any

2642
02:43:10,450 --> 02:43:12,565
cost, whatever the
balance between the two

2643
02:43:12,690 --> 02:43:15,225
firearms and atomic
weapons as part of our arsenal.

2644
02:43:15,350 --> 02:43:19,300
What moral qualities
do they have with this?

2645
02:43:19,450 --> 02:43:22,225
What moral qualities does he have?

2646
02:43:22,350 --> 02:43:24,175
Yes, it's true.  Oppenheimer
wanted to have an atomic bomb.

2647
02:43:24,300 --> 02:43:27,225
He wanted to be a man who
could move the world.  He

2648
02:43:27,350 --> 02:43:30,175
says the nuclear chain is
to put it back in the bottle.

2649
02:43:30,300 --> 02:43:33,175
Well, I'm here to tell
you that I know one.

2650
02:43:33,300 --> 02:43:37,175
If J. Robert Oppenheimer could
do it all, he would do it again.

2651
02:43:37,300 --> 02:43:39,875
You know you never said that.

2652
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:43,175
He feels sorry for Hiroshima.
He would do anything.  Why?

2653
02:43:43,300 --> 02:43:48,300
Because to him is the most
important man who ever lived.

2654
02:43:48,450 --> 02:43:52,175
We used the atomic
bomb liberally.

2655
02:43:52,300 --> 02:43:54,275
In fact, Dr. Badger argued
that in choosing a target

2656
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:56,175
Dropping an atomic
bomb on Japan, right?

2657
02:43:56,300 --> 02:43:57,176
Yes

2658
02:43:57,301 --> 02:44:00,175
So did you know, did you know, that
by dropping an atomic bomb on a target

2659
02:44:00,300 --> 02:44:03,175
you killed thousands of civilians
with one assassin wounded.  It is true?

2660
02:44:03,300 --> 02:44:06,175
Yes, it's true.
Not as much as it seems.

2661
02:44:06,300 --> 02:44:09,175
How many people died?

2662
02:44:09,300 --> 02:44:10,176
Seventy thousand

2663
02:44:10,301 --> 02:44:13,175
Seventy thousand from Hiroshima and...
One hundred thousand from both.

2664
02:44:13,300 --> 02:44:15,175
Every day of bombing.

2665
02:44:15,300 --> 02:44:18,175
Yes, it is.  One of the
weeks and years to come.

2666
02:44:18,300 --> 02:44:21,175
It is estimated that there are between
fifty and one hundred thousand.

2667
02:44:21,300 --> 02:44:23,175
At least two hundred
and twenty thousand dead.

2668
02:44:23,300 --> 02:44:24,176
Yes.

2669
02:44:24,301 --> 02:44:26,175
This is the reason
for the moral scoop.

2670
02:44:26,300 --> 02:44:28,175
Horrible.

2671
02:44:28,300 --> 02:44:32,175
But did you testify to me that the
bombing of Hiroshima was a success?

2672
02:44:32,300 --> 02:44:34,175
Technically it was a success.

2673
02:44:34,300 --> 02:44:36,175
Technically very successful.

2674
02:44:36,300 --> 02:44:43,307
It's right next to us and we,
even as humans, can't go this way.

2675
02:45:06,300 --> 02:45:07,176
We are acting.

2676
02:45:07,301 --> 02:45:09,145
You are against rollover

2677
02:45:09,270 --> 02:45:12,175
Thermal nuclear weapons in
Japan due to moral concerns?

2678
02:45:12,300 --> 02:45:13,176
You said I would.

2679
02:45:13,301 --> 02:45:15,105
If I was against
dropping the nuke.

2680
02:45:15,230 --> 02:45:17,175
Bomb Hiroshima
for moral reasons.

2681
02:45:17,300 --> 02:45:19,175
We expressed ourselves... I know.  A
thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand.

2682
02:45:19,300 --> 02:45:21,175
I wanted... I see you

2683
02:45:21,300 --> 02:45:25,175
I should have made our arguments against
his release, but I did not support them.

2684
02:45:25,300 --> 02:45:28,175
So, after three years of working
day and night, he made a bomb.

2685
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:30,175
Then you squared
off against the tool.

2686
02:45:30,300 --> 02:45:34,175
The Minister of War asked me
what the opinion of the scientists was.

2687
02:45:34,300 --> 02:45:36,175
I gave them
counter-opinions and opinions.

2688
02:45:36,300 --> 02:45:37,176
You supported the study.

2689
02:45:37,301 --> 02:45:39,175
You had no problems
with the plan.

2690
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:40,175
supported

2691
02:45:40,300 --> 02:45:41,176
I didn't mean "supported".

2692
02:45:41,301 --> 02:45:43,175
You helped select
the target, right?

2693
02:45:43,300 --> 02:45:44,176
I've done my job

2694
02:45:44,301 --> 02:45:46,175
I had no political
position at Los Alamos.

2695
02:45:46,300 --> 02:45:48,175
I did whatever was asked of me.

2696
02:45:48,300 --> 02:45:51,175
Then you wouldn't marry a
hydrogen bomb, would you?

2697
02:45:51,300 --> 02:45:53,175
That's not what I
asked you, doctor.

2698
02:45:53,300 --> 02:45:58,175
The GAC reported that she left
after the broadcast and the target said.

2699
02:45:58,300 --> 02:46:01,175
A super bomb
should never be built.

2700
02:46:01,300 --> 02:46:02,176
What do I mean, what do I mean?

2701
02:46:02,301 --> 02:46:06,175
I thought you knew what I meant.

2702
02:46:06,300 --> 02:46:09,175
Are the Russians doing
nothing to increase their power?

2703
02:46:09,300 --> 02:46:12,175
If we did it, they should too.

2704
02:46:12,300 --> 02:46:16,175
Our efforts would only encourage their
efforts, just as they did with the atomic bomb.

2705
02:46:16,300 --> 02:46:19,300
Just like the atomic bomb.

2706
02:46:20,150 --> 02:46:24,300
In 1945 there was no moral
school, in 1949 it was plentiful.

2707
02:46:28,650 --> 02:46:32,955
Oppenheimer, when are you here?

2708
02:46:33,080 --> 02:46:38,300
Did he develop strong moral
beliefs about the hydrogen bomb?

2709
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:52,207
When it was clear to me that whatever weapon
we had available we would tend to use it,

2710
02:46:53,950 --> 02:46:59,300
Martyr J. Robert Oppenheimer, I
gave him exactly what he wanted.

2711
02:46:59,450 --> 02:47:06,457
He remembers Trinity, not
Hiroshima, not Nagasaki.

2712
02:47:08,800 --> 02:47:11,300
You should thank me.

2713
02:47:11,550 --> 02:47:15,300
It is not so

2714
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:17,567
Do we still have enough votes?

2715
02:47:17,850 --> 02:47:20,475
Or it could be the
pinnacle of my career.

2716
02:47:20,600 --> 02:47:23,467
the biggest public
humiliation of my life?

2717
02:47:23,700 --> 02:47:26,300
It's about the whole sentence.

2718
02:47:26,550 --> 02:47:29,175
Don't draw.
Well then take the press.

2719
02:47:29,300 --> 02:47:33,375
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, this
Council, based on his testimony

2720
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:37,275
From him and many
of his current and former

2721
02:47:37,400 --> 02:47:43,300
colleagues, that you
are a loyal citizen.

2722
02:47:43,850 --> 02:47:47,795
However, in light of your
continued associations and

2723
02:47:47,920 --> 02:47:52,300
disrespect for this
country's security apparatus,

2724
02:47:52,700 --> 02:47:55,085
with your somewhat
disturbing behavior

2725
02:47:55,210 --> 02:47:57,275
in relation to the
hydrogen bomb program.

2726
02:47:57,400 --> 02:48:02,734
and the incredible lack of honesty
in this committee and in some of your

2727
02:48:02,900 --> 02:48:08,367
responses we voted two to one to deny
the renewal of your security clearance.

2728
02:48:08,900 --> 02:48:11,665
Written opinion
complete with dissent

2729
02:48:11,790 --> 02:48:15,300
Evans' report will be published
by the AEC in the coming days.

2730
02:48:15,850 --> 02:48:18,300
That's all

2731
02:48:20,850 --> 02:48:23,300
Council member.

2732
02:48:27,500 --> 02:48:29,300
Robert.

2733
02:48:29,500 --> 02:48:31,175
Robert.

2734
02:48:31,300 --> 02:48:36,300
Do not say that

2735
02:48:37,950 --> 02:48:40,300
Don't buy sheets.

2736
02:48:41,170 --> 02:48:48,177
It's official?

2737
02:48:55,800 --> 02:49:00,300
Unexpected problems arose.

2738
02:49:04,550 --> 02:49:07,300
Yes, was I rejected?

2739
02:49:07,700 --> 02:49:09,175
I'm afraid so, sir.

2740
02:49:09,300 --> 02:49:11,300
Naturally.

2741
02:49:17,050 --> 02:49:18,176
Who are those who resisted?

2742
02:49:18,301 --> 02:49:21,315
There were three of them,
led by a junior senator.

2743
02:49:21,440 --> 02:49:25,300
Massachusetts and a
man trying to make it.

2744
02:49:25,500 --> 02:49:28,175
I don't like what you
did to Oppenheimer.

2745
02:49:28,300 --> 02:49:30,175
What is his name?

2746
02:49:30,300 --> 02:49:31,700
Kennedy.

2747
02:49:31,900 --> 02:49:33,300
John F. Kennedy.

2748
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:38,945
When you let them talk or get

2749
02:49:39,070 --> 02:49:41,175
involved, will the
world forgive you?

2750
02:49:41,300 --> 02:49:44,300
not gonna happen

2751
02:49:45,250 --> 02:49:47,300
We will see

2752
02:49:48,100 --> 02:49:54,300
I am sorry

2753
02:50:02,050 --> 02:50:03,450
Please.

2754
02:50:07,450 --> 02:50:14,457
You told me I'd be fine.

2755
02:50:15,550 --> 02:50:17,475
I didn't have all
the facts, did I?

2756
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:19,175
Here is the truth

2757
02:50:19,300 --> 02:50:23,175
President Eisenhower pinned the
Medal of Freedom to my chest last year.

2758
02:50:23,300 --> 02:50:25,175
because I've always done
the right thing for this country.

2759
02:50:25,300 --> 02:50:27,300
They don't want
me in the toilet.

2760
02:50:27,500 --> 02:50:29,175
No problem

2761
02:50:29,300 --> 02:50:32,275
Maybe they should invite
Oppenheimer over for him.

2762
02:50:32,400 --> 02:50:34,275
Maybe they will.

2763
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:36,955
I told you he's turning the
scientists against you one by one.

2764
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:39,175
Me, starting with Einstein.

2765
02:50:39,300 --> 02:50:42,175
I told you about it, Einstein.
I said near the pond.

2766
02:50:42,300 --> 02:50:44,300
You know it, but you know it, sir,

2767
02:50:45,150 --> 02:50:48,185
no one knows what they are saying.

2768
02:50:48,310 --> 02:50:51,300
it is impossible that they
have never talked about you.

2769
02:50:51,450 --> 02:50:54,300
It's impossible that they
talked about such a thing...

2770
02:50:54,550 --> 02:50:56,300
It's more important than I know.

2771
02:50:59,300 --> 02:51:06,307
Okay thanks.

2772
02:51:14,700 --> 02:51:21,300
The man of today

2773
02:51:22,450 --> 02:51:28,175
He once organized a reception for
me.  He actually gave me an award.

2774
02:51:28,300 --> 02:51:30,300
Yes.

2775
02:51:30,500 --> 02:51:35,300
You all thought I had lost the
ability to recognize what had begun.

2776
02:51:35,670 --> 02:51:41,300
So the award wasn't really
for me.  It was for all of you.

2777
02:51:43,200 --> 02:51:50,207
Now it's your turn to face the
consequences of your success.

2778
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:55,300
And one day, when they've
punished you enough,

2779
02:51:56,600 --> 02:52:01,300
you will need salmon
and potato salad.

2780
02:52:04,700 --> 02:52:07,300
Thank you peach

2781
02:52:07,550 --> 02:52:10,300
Self...

2782
02:52:11,350 --> 02:52:15,300
Oh Frank.  You are
happy, I am happy.

2783
02:52:15,550 --> 02:52:21,175
I'll turn around and
say all is forgiven.

2784
02:52:21,300 --> 02:52:27,300
Remember, it won't be for you.

2785
02:52:28,600 --> 02:52:35,607
It will be for them.

2786
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:40,175
Help me.  Help me.

When I came to you
with these calculations,

2788
02:52:55,300 --> 02:53:01,175
we thought we could set off a chain reaction
that would destroy the entire world.

2789
02:53:01,300 --> 02:53:04,175
I am in the world

2790
02:53:04,300 --> 02:53:07,300
What happened?

2791
02:53:08,750 --> 02:53:13,300
I think we did.

2792
02:53:14,300 --> 02:53:17,300
I think so.

2793
02:53:18,300 --> 02:53:21,300
I think we did.

2794
02:53:22,300 --> 02:53:25,300
I think we did.

2795
02:53:26,300 --> 02:53:29,300
I think we did.

2796
02:53:29,425 --> 02:53:36,432
