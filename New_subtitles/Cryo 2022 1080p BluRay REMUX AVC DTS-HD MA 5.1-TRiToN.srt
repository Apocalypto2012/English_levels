1
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:31,923
Do you know the first
Bible story I heard as a boy?

2
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,299
Lazarus raised from the dead.

3
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:39,898
After that, I always wished
I could bring back Mother.

4
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:43,671
Of course, that never happened,

5
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:49,314
But I'll always remember
those first embers of hope.

6
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:52,383
Maybe someone could.

7
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,522
I won't hurt you.

8
00:03:45,822 --> 00:03:46,822
Who are you?

9
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:49,186
Hey.

10
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:51,122
It's all right, it's all right.

11
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:52,157
Come on out.

12
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,896
What are your names?

13
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:56,931
What are yours?

14
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,230
We don't know.

15
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:01,770
None of us?

16
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:02,903
We heard a gunshot.

17
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,092
- What you doing?
- Who are you?!

18
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:28,127
Where am I?!

19
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:30,634
You were in cryo, you idiot!

20
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:37,707
Cryo?

21
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:39,544
Like cryonics, right?

22
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:42,580
Long term human preservation?

23
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,242
I wasn't certain at
first, but I engineered

24
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:46,881
the cryo chambers.

25
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,212
Those machines we woke up in.

26
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:49,785
That's right.

27
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,620
We were the team assembled
to test cryo sleep.

28
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:56,121
Okay, so we're a team, which
means we must all have jobs.

29
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:59,355
I don't even remember my name.

30
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,324
So apart from
losing our memories,

31
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:04,162
anyone experiencing any
other negative side effects?

32
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:07,011
Shouldn't there
have been someone

33
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:09,134
who was supposed to
meet us here?

34
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:11,103
To let us know if the
test even and worked,

35
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:12,973
to help us remember
what had happened?

36
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:15,206
The inventor, maybe
he woke us up.

37
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:16,812
The inventor...?

38
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:18,880
Of the cryo sleep technology.

39
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:20,750
He was my colleague.

40
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:23,214
He was supposed to wake us
up and evaluate the test.

41
00:05:24,184 --> 00:05:25,184
So where is he?

42
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:28,692
Maybe those machines
we were in malfunctioned.

43
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,023
That's impossible.

44
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:31,058
How so?

45
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:32,862
'Cause I built 'em.

46
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:36,029
Does anyone hear that?

47
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:36,898
There's something scratching.

48
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:38,130
Power's out.

49
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,175
Perhaps that's what woke us up.

50
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,166
That's not what woke us up.

51
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:43,102
The cryo chambers have
to be opened manually.

52
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:45,368
There's gotta be another
power source.

53
00:05:45,403 --> 00:05:49,647
Look, if those chambers
malfunctioned, we would all be dead.

54
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,945
You sure remember a lot.

55
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:53,145
We heard a gunshot.

56
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,653
Why do you think I was
hiding out?

57
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,084
I saw someone's shadow moving
around the moment I woke up.

58
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,668
I hear something.

59
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,988
It sounds like rats!

60
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:02,264
This inventor of
yours, he wasn't planning

61
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:04,321
on using a gun to wake us up,
was he?

62
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:06,664
Maybe we should go.

63
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:12,934
Just stay here, okay?

64
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:13,969
He'll come.

65
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,937
I say we get some rest.

66
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,108
Weren't we just hibernating?

67
00:06:25,443 --> 00:06:27,245
I wish I could remember.

68
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,049
Our memories are gonna
come back.

69
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:33,053
It's just that our senses are
gonna be a little unreliable.

70
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:38,124
Don't trust anything you see.

71
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:10,487
I found these.

72
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,063
The inventor never showed.

73
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,338
Anyone remember their names?

74
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,228
All right guys, let's
go have a look around.

75
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:58,006
Did you notice there's no number
on him?

76
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:01,746
You think he had something
to do with the gunshot?

77
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,474
You heard a gunshot?

78
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,381
We should keep a close eye
on him.

79
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:22,228
You still think
the inventor's here?

80
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:23,999
Oh, he's here all right.

81
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:26,870
He'd sacrifice anything
to protect his work.

82
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:28,872
He said cryo was his gift
to mankind.

83
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:31,809
We could discover a new planet,

84
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,877
even go as far as
the ninth sphere.

85
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:35,043
The ninth sphere?

86
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,277
Of heaven.

87
00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:41,346
Yeah, the inventor loved
making religious allusions.

88
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,251
He thought technology
could achieve the divine.

89
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,357
Why would there be an airlock?

90
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:00,299
All right.

91
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,609
Well, let's spread out and see
if we can find the inventor.

92
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,171
Let's find us some beds.

93
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:07,240
Yeah, maybe he fell asleep.

94
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:54,892
This place is a mess.

95
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,195
Hey.

96
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,230
Sunlight.

97
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:05,364
I think it leads outside.

98
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:10,204
It's sealed off up there.

99
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,404
Let's keep looking.

100
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,311
Dante.

101
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:07,381
The ninth sphere of heaven.

102
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,416
Dante.

103
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:12,122
"They are
preserved for a wise purpose."

104
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:15,488
Which purpose is known unto God.

105
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:18,623
And God's course is
one eternal round.

106
00:13:38,414 --> 00:13:39,414
Guys!

107
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:42,747
Someone?!

108
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:05,506
Open it.

109
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:20,718
This is fresh.

110
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:26,526
If the inventor was here,
he's dead now.

111
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,462
We can't be sure this
is his blood.

112
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:29,595
Then who woke us up?

113
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:34,930
Well, I'm out.

114
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:36,404
Wait.

115
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:37,439
Wait!

116
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,278
Get outta my way.

117
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,382
No.

118
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:48,779
Not a chance.

119
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:49,945
What are we doing?

120
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,782
This genius here wants
to poison us.

121
00:14:51,817 --> 00:14:52,783
What?

122
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:54,455
Why not let him go?

123
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,556
Because we don't know
how long we've been asleep.

124
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:59,229
What are you talking about?

125
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:00,670
Well, if the inventor
was supposed to wake us up,

126
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:04,300
and he didn't,
then somebody else did.

127
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:06,599
Could have been somebody
just looking for shelter

128
00:15:06,634 --> 00:15:07,798
or human touch.

129
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:11,505
Anything could have
happened out there.

130
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:17,742
Look, you all can do what
you, but I'm taking off.

131
00:15:17,777 --> 00:15:18,809
The engineer's right.

132
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:20,283
Just don't go up there just yet.

133
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:21,482
Why not?

134
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:22,890
'Cause we don't know
what's up there.

135
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:24,594
- I'll take my chances.
- Wait, wait, wait.

136
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:27,323
We're dealing with the
unknown now, all right?

137
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:28,951
And we have to account
for entropy,

138
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:31,690
which suggests that a state
of order will certainly

139
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:33,263
I don't have time for
your bullshit!

140
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:35,859
Listen, why do you
think there's an air lock?

141
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,894
You don't have
any protective gear.

142
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:39,698
If you go up there
and open that airlock,

143
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,536
the air could kill you, and
then we'll be stuck down here.

144
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:44,637
So, what, like chemical warfare?

145
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:46,936
Not necessarily, it
could have been a virus

146
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:48,773
or a sun flare.

147
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:50,676
Hell, Darwinism.

148
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:52,348
Entropy.

149
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:53,459
Things will always descend
into a state of disorder.

150
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:55,450
Anything could have happened.

151
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:58,552
My discipline, biochemistry.
It's coming back.

152
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:03,656
Assuming the inventor
didn't make it...

153
00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:07,693
How long could those cryo
chambers preserve someone?

154
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:10,861
Well, they were meant
to preserve life

155
00:16:10,896 --> 00:16:12,907
at all costs, even heal the
most critical conditions.

156
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:13,996
So how long?

157
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:15,701
I mean, theoretically speaking,

158
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:18,539
it could be centuries, even
a thousand years or more,

159
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:19,574
I don't know.

160
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:21,872
No, no.

161
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:23,643
How do we know the inventor
isn't outside

162
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:25,513
waiting for us right now?

163
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:26,646
We don't.

164
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:27,614
I'm gonna go out there
and check.

165
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:28,714
We have to assume.

166
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:30,683
That we're not alone down here.

167
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:33,884
In case you forgot, we just
found a blood-soaked machete.

168
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:39,989
It's still safer down here.

169
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:42,024
No, down here,
at least we can breathe.

170
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:44,598
Okay.

171
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:45,731
Okay, all right.

172
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:48,470
But we need light.

173
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:50,439
These aren't gonna cut it.

174
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:53,937
If I'm gonna stay down
here, we have to get

175
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,444
the main power back on.

176
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:15,794
Do you think you'll need a hand?

177
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,598
You, you're coming with me.

178
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:18,764
What, why me?

179
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,974
Because Gramps here
isn't gonna fit.

180
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:20,865
Gramps will kick your.

181
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,734
What are these two?

182
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:22,769
I'm happy to help.

183
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:25,067
Get in here!

184
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:26,102
Go.

185
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:42,525
There!

186
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:44,527
Yeah, that's it.

187
00:17:45,562 --> 00:17:47,430
It looks like it's
been sabotaged.

188
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,686
You're gonna use a metal pole?

189
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,611
Would you rather use your hand?!

190
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:07,616
Here we go.

191
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:11,685
Okay, come here!

192
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,456
- What?
- Come here, grab this!

193
00:18:15,757 --> 00:18:17,119
So cryo sleep wiped everything

194
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:20,056
except how to fix the generator,

195
00:18:20,091 --> 00:18:22,091
You know, my training's
kicking it.

196
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:24,159
- Pretty sure I'm military.
- What?

197
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:26,370
Communications and technology.

198
00:18:38,516 --> 00:18:40,615
Do not drop that on me.

199
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,595
- Okay, all right!
- You almost done?

200
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,794
Yeah, almost.

201
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:56,532
We gotta let the generator run
for a bit

202
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:58,666
before I can turn the
circuit breaker back on.

203
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:00,461
I don't know how much
longer I can hold this.

204
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:06,443
- Okay, that should do it.
- Okay.

205
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,939
All right, on three.

206
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:08,974
One!

207
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:10,040
Two!

208
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:11,075
Three!

209
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:17,014
He's injured!

210
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:19,885
- His chest, his whole chest!
- Grab him!

211
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:22,822
Follow me, I know what to do.

212
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,956
Hey, you're okay, you're okay.

213
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:28,597
Easy, easy, easy.

214
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:34,900
What the hell?

215
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:36,242
I thought you said the
wound was on his chest.

216
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:38,101
- What happened?
- No, I didn't do anything.

217
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,180
He just had me holding up all
these wires and I couldn't.

218
00:19:40,204 --> 00:19:41,709
I believe that.

219
00:19:41,744 --> 00:19:43,216
Bandages and tape
behind you, do you mind?

220
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,108
Lucky for you I remember my job.

221
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,143
I'm a doctor.

222
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:52,159
What happened to your number?

223
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:54,183
That's what I'd like to know.

224
00:19:56,055 --> 00:19:58,121
I don't know, this is just
what I found.

225
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:01,630
Maybe the numbers fell off.

226
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:02,705
No, they're stitched on.

227
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,604
How am I supposed to know
what happened?

228
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,001
You're the only variable.

229
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:15,578
You serious?

230
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:21,210
Well, I think this settles it.

231
00:20:21,245 --> 00:20:22,849
We need to try our luck outside.

232
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:24,213
No, they were being careless.

233
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:25,984
This was avoidable.

234
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:28,723
How long do you think we
will last in a place like this?

235
00:20:28,758 --> 00:20:30,824
We don't have the resources.

236
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:32,089
That may not be true.

237
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,232
What do you see?

238
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:45,135
This is definitely
the other power source.

239
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,874
There's computers, radios, food.

240
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,008
Plenty of food.

241
00:20:50,043 --> 00:20:51,944
So life or death behind
this door.

242
00:20:53,244 --> 00:20:54,782
Anyone know the code?

243
00:20:56,885 --> 00:21:00,722
All right, we've got 1, 2, 3, 5.

244
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:02,790
Why don't we try the
mystery man's number here?

245
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:13,229
Let me try.

246
00:21:13,264 --> 00:21:15,198
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, please, please.

247
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,782
Two more incorrect
guesses and we're gonna be

248
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:17,970
locked out permanently.

249
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,346
Who's to even say that
it's one of our numbers?

250
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,975
It could be any thousand
number of possibilities.

251
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,141
He's right.

252
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:26,242
Let's search the facilities
some more.

253
00:21:26,277 --> 00:21:29,014
Give it a little more time.
It might come back to us.

254
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:30,851
It could be written down
somewhere.

255
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,625
Be careful.

256
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:54,611
Hey, this is fun.

257
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:58,813
They say music's good for memory.

258
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:02,081
Nice.

259
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:18,767
Anything?

260
00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:19,966
I've checked every room.

261
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:21,902
There's no one else down here.

262
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:23,970
Well, keep looking.

263
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:26,643
The inventor's here all right.

264
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,045
I found these and some water.

265
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,784
Well, that's something.

266
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:11,116
Well, don't you have a
knack for finding things?

267
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:14,416
Any indication what's in them?

268
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:16,088
No idea.

269
00:23:16,123 --> 00:23:18,453
But I found enough to
last maybe a week.

270
00:23:18,488 --> 00:23:19,993
Anyone have a can opener?

271
00:23:30,302 --> 00:23:31,302
What is it?

272
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:40,783
Soldier, I don't think
that's sanitary.

273
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,222
Seems okay.

274
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:52,993
It's not steak, but it'll do.

275
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:54,830
Thank God.

276
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:56,029
I'm so hungry.

277
00:23:56,064 --> 00:23:58,097
Being frozen burns
a lot of calories.

278
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,488
You're cheating, you
can't talk out loud.

279
00:24:15,512 --> 00:24:17,347
I'm just thinking out loud!

280
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:18,821
Hey, Grandpa Graybeard.

281
00:24:21,188 --> 00:24:22,396
Hold on just a minute, folks.

282
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,452
It's Professor Plum.

283
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:25,058
He hasn't shown up at all.

284
00:24:25,093 --> 00:24:26,059
No, I don't know.

285
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:27,863
Nope, I think I got it here.

286
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:31,394
Okay, so I accuse Mrs. White
with the revolver in the study.

287
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:35,101
Very bold of you.

288
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:43,043
He's right!

289
00:24:43,078 --> 00:24:44,110
Dang!

290
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:45,441
This freaking game is rigged.

291
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:46,849
What? No! How do you rig Clue?

292
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:47,509
No, no, no.

293
00:24:47,544 --> 00:24:49,181
I deserve another!

294
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:16,879
Is it from cryo sleep?

295
00:25:18,377 --> 00:25:21,950
There's no way to tell. It
could be how her body reacts.

296
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:24,854
Why haven't our memories
come back yet?

297
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:26,064
Maybe we were asleep too long.

298
00:25:26,088 --> 00:25:27,088
They'll come.

299
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:29,485
Let's just call it a night.

300
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,827
That's a good idea.

301
00:25:38,562 --> 00:25:39,902
It's all right.

302
00:25:39,937 --> 00:25:40,937
I'll watch her.

303
00:25:51,608 --> 00:25:52,608
Okay.

304
00:25:54,347 --> 00:25:57,018
If you are watching this,
I'm going to use

305
00:25:57,053 --> 00:25:59,152
this camera to keep track
of information.

306
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:03,156
We don't remember any
personal details,

307
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:06,423
but we have figured out the
roles for the rest of the team.

308
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,524
There's an engineer
who we know helped

309
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,295
construct the cryo chambers.

310
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:14,134
He's convinced himself that
the inventor is still alive

311
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:16,268
despite evidence of the contrary.

312
00:26:18,305 --> 00:26:21,240
And the biochemist,
who is here to monitor

313
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:26,377
the effects of coolant on our
enzymes, DNA, and molecules.

314
00:26:26,412 --> 00:26:29,017
He is frantic and unpredictable.

315
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:33,318
There is the military
communications

316
00:26:33,353 --> 00:26:35,122
and technology specialist.

317
00:26:37,423 --> 00:26:39,027
I know he's hiding something.

318
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:43,658
And the doctor,

319
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:46,067
who doesn't wanna show
that she's getting sick.

320
00:26:48,104 --> 00:26:50,137
The only person
I don't know is...

321
00:26:53,373 --> 00:26:54,373
God.

322
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:57,408
I'm a psychologist.

323
00:28:22,297 --> 00:28:23,494
We need to ration.

324
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:27,234
Good morning.

325
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:28,763
I think.

326
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:31,700
- How you feeling?
- I'm fine, thanks.

327
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:38,443
I keep getting this feeling
that someone is watching me.

328
00:28:38,478 --> 00:28:40,115
I know what you mean.

329
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:43,580
I was just telling the engineer

330
00:28:43,615 --> 00:28:44,515
that we probably need to ration.

331
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,681
Where's the soldier?

332
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:13,082
For a soldier, you don't
have very many battle scars.

333
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,415
Well, now you have one
to remember.

334
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,647
How's your injury doing?

335
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:25,160
Let me take a look.

336
00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:29,725
Let me ask you something.

337
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:33,171
Aren't you a little concerned
that someone

338
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:35,203
might murder you in your sleep?

339
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:41,539
That's a bit personal, isn't it?

340
00:29:41,574 --> 00:29:42,574
Is it?

341
00:29:50,352 --> 00:29:52,748
You're worried that
gunshot killed the inventor.

342
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:55,553
I'm worried about the figure
that was hovering over me

343
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:57,291
when I woke up.

344
00:29:57,326 --> 00:29:59,821
There's a lunatic out there
and we're going to carry on

345
00:29:59,856 --> 00:30:02,824
with our little experiment
like nothing's wrong?

346
00:30:04,597 --> 00:30:06,663
The engineer seems to think
you did it.

347
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,634
The engineer is a moron.

348
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:13,439
He's suspicious of
all the wrong signs.

349
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:15,606
What exactly should he
be looking for?

350
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:18,246
It's poison outside?

351
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:22,448
Fine, but wouldn't the
intruder be getting sick

352
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:25,649
from exposure to
radioactivity or something?

353
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:28,652
Wouldn't they want to load up
on our food

354
00:30:28,687 --> 00:30:30,192
and make a break for it?

355
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:34,856
Or try taking us out,
one by one?

356
00:30:46,771 --> 00:30:49,772
Hey, could you give me
a psychoanalysis?

357
00:30:50,874 --> 00:30:53,215
Could you start with your
medical examination first

358
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,250
if you don't mind?

359
00:31:17,604 --> 00:31:18,636
It's for the pain.

360
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:42,363
Apart from the burn, you're
healthy as one can be.

361
00:31:44,895 --> 00:31:45,895
Excuse me.

362
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:01,310
Blood pressure's high.

363
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:04,808
Considering the circumstances.

364
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:13,751
Deep breath for me.

365
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:28,799
What do you think of all this?

366
00:33:31,573 --> 00:33:33,441
I just want answers.

367
00:33:33,476 --> 00:33:34,970
I just wanna know my own name.

368
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,511
Know that I'm safe.

369
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:43,451
Any luck on discovering
when we are?

370
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,718
No.

371
00:33:46,753 --> 00:33:49,391
Without any samples to compare,
and without carbon dating,

372
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:50,986
it's gonna be nearly...

373
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:52,021
Shit.

374
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:54,891
Excuse me.

375
00:33:54,926 --> 00:33:56,629
Is everything all right?

376
00:33:56,664 --> 00:34:00,402
Yeah, it's just...

377
00:34:00,437 --> 00:34:01,997
Does it feel cold in here
to you?

378
00:34:06,575 --> 00:34:08,003
Why are we doing this again?

379
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:12,348
It's your psychoanalysis.

380
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,042
Just wanna make sure
you're sane.

381
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:17,947
So if you could please
just answer

382
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:19,520
as truthfully as possible.

383
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:21,853
What is your name?

384
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:24,888
Sergeant I don't give a shit.

385
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:28,122
You still don't remember.

386
00:34:28,157 --> 00:34:29,629
Let me know when you do.

387
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,899
And you have military training.

388
00:34:35,934 --> 00:34:36,934
What branch?

389
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,004
What about all your injuries?

390
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,710
Are there any images,
impressions?

391
00:34:44,745 --> 00:34:46,008
A tour in the Middle East?

392
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,621
Okay, what's the last
thing you do remember?

393
00:34:57,626 --> 00:34:59,626
You, actually.

394
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:06,831
I am freezing.

395
00:35:08,098 --> 00:35:09,702
Is there anything
I can do to help?

396
00:35:14,104 --> 00:35:15,807
Hey, come sit here.

397
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:36,663
I was thinking-
It's much better.

398
00:35:36,698 --> 00:35:37,698
Thank you.

399
00:35:39,195 --> 00:35:40,997
It's nothing to worry about.

400
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:09,597
I remember you,
telling me something

401
00:36:09,632 --> 00:36:11,500
right before I went into
cryo sleep.

402
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:13,667
Really?

403
00:36:13,702 --> 00:36:14,734
Okay, well, that's good.

404
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:15,966
Something about cryo sleep.

405
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:17,737
What did I say,
was it important?

406
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:19,805
Yeah, yeah.

407
00:36:20,774 --> 00:36:22,973
Are there any images
or any impressions?

408
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:27,011
Soldier?

409
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:30,453
Is it the cryo sleep?

410
00:36:32,952 --> 00:36:36,954
Probably just a cold, a
little fever or something.

411
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:46,569
Soldier?

412
00:36:48,132 --> 00:36:49,802
- I can't remember.
- What was it?

413
00:36:49,837 --> 00:36:52,871
- I was standing there and-
- And then?

414
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:53,971
I can't remember.

415
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:55,269
Yes, yes you can, just think.

416
00:36:55,304 --> 00:36:58,041
I was in the cryo chamber, and.

417
00:36:58,076 --> 00:36:59,207
And what did I say?

418
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:00,010
You were looking at me
and I don't.

419
00:37:00,045 --> 00:37:01,011
What was it?

420
00:37:01,046 --> 00:37:02,650
I don't fucking remember!

421
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:12,924
I shouldn't have
pushed you so far.

422
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,860
That was unprofessional of me.

423
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:17,028
I'm truly sorry.

424
00:37:22,705 --> 00:37:23,705
What did you say?

425
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,609
I'm truly sorry.

426
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:33,682
Go to hell.

427
00:38:09,345 --> 00:38:10,916
So what about the soldier?

428
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:14,217
What about him?

429
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:17,285
Do you think we should
trust him?

430
00:38:19,058 --> 00:38:20,058
Do you?

431
00:38:25,702 --> 00:38:27,031
What can I do for you?

432
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:18,885
Hey.

433
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,282
Could I borrow you for a minute?

434
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,064
I promise I will be
ready for your evaluation

435
00:39:22,088 --> 00:39:23,219
in just a moment.

436
00:39:23,254 --> 00:39:25,892
No, it's not that,
it's the doctor.

437
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,664
I'm worried that cryo sleep
may have left

438
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,897
some lingering effects on
her cellular processes.

439
00:39:30,932 --> 00:39:32,162
Seriously, I am fine.

440
00:39:32,197 --> 00:39:33,064
Are you sure?

441
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:34,099
How do you know that?

442
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:35,308
She's been acting strangely,

443
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:37,431
and all the physical
manifestations.

444
00:39:37,466 --> 00:39:38,971
I don't know,
you seem cognitively.

445
00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:40,236
Enough.

446
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:41,677
Both of you, please.

447
00:39:42,405 --> 00:39:43,877
You're stressing me out.

448
00:40:08,497 --> 00:40:09,497
See?

449
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:12,070
You guys better go,
I'll catch up/.

450
00:40:13,337 --> 00:40:14,171
What?

451
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:15,469
Guys?

452
00:40:15,504 --> 00:40:17,174
We have a problem.

453
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:30,892
What's wrong?

454
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:34,125
This morning,
there were 12 cans,

455
00:40:35,293 --> 00:40:36,699
and now there's only 11.

456
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:40,362
What, someone stole food?

457
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:42,398
Who would do that?

458
00:41:35,925 --> 00:41:39,223
This food and water is
not going to last forever,

459
00:41:39,258 --> 00:41:42,226
which is something we
need to be mindful of.

460
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:45,834
No one is to take food
without asking.

461
00:41:49,532 --> 00:41:52,566
Hey.

462
00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:54,304
What are you doing?

463
00:41:55,505 --> 00:41:57,142
What?

464
00:41:57,177 --> 00:41:59,782
What are you doing with
the doctor's cryo chamber?

465
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,886
I just had to be sure.

466
00:42:06,153 --> 00:42:07,153
Sure about what?

467
00:42:09,618 --> 00:42:11,156
That her chamber

468
00:42:11,191 --> 00:42:13,191
everything's okay.

469
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:14,226
And?

470
00:42:33,213 --> 00:42:37,479
And someone here is not
who they say they are.

471
00:42:39,582 --> 00:42:42,957
I don't think this was part
of the inventor's design.

472
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,522
Communications and technology.

473
00:42:54,663 --> 00:42:57,169
I don't know what that is.

474
00:42:59,008 --> 00:43:00,601
What about these?

475
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:02,977
Why are you going through
my stuff?

476
00:43:03,012 --> 00:43:04,440
You have radios?

477
00:43:04,475 --> 00:43:05,342
We're saved!

478
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:07,443
No, we're not.

479
00:43:07,478 --> 00:43:10,380
We're buried underground
surrounded by brick walls.

480
00:43:10,415 --> 00:43:12,382
The frequency isn't gonna
reach anyone.

481
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:14,120
So what do we do?

482
00:43:14,155 --> 00:43:16,265
I mean, there has to be some
way we can get them to work.

483
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:17,552
We need to get outside.

484
00:43:18,588 --> 00:43:19,994
Wait just hold on a second.

485
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:21,138
Have you forgotten
about the toxins?

486
00:43:21,162 --> 00:43:22,656
Someone is still out there.

487
00:43:22,691 --> 00:43:23,998
No.

488
00:43:24,033 --> 00:43:25,340
Whoever opened up
the cryo chambers

489
00:43:25,364 --> 00:43:27,265
is in this room right now.

490
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,905
- How can you be sure?
- He can't.

491
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,973
Like you said, there's no one.

492
00:43:32,008 --> 00:43:33,106
Right.

493
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:36,010
Down here, including
a missing body.

494
00:43:36,705 --> 00:43:38,210
Unless you found one?

495
00:43:39,213 --> 00:43:41,642
Then the only way to be
sure is by going outside,

496
00:43:41,677 --> 00:43:44,249
because if it is one of
us, staying down here

497
00:43:44,284 --> 00:43:45,987
is just as unsafe.

498
00:43:46,022 --> 00:43:49,683
We can't go outside until
we've tested that it's safe.

499
00:43:49,718 --> 00:43:51,256
What would that take?

500
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:08,504
I think I should go.

501
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:09,945
No way.

502
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,441
Why not?

503
00:44:11,476 --> 00:44:13,608
You won't come back, you'll
leave us all down here.

504
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:15,687
You did say you wanted to leave.

505
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:17,414
Okay, well, if not me, then who?

506
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:18,449
Me.

507
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,220
I'm going.

508
00:44:23,488 --> 00:44:25,092
You know that in your
prison condition,

509
00:44:25,127 --> 00:44:26,137
it's gonna be so much
more dangerous for you.

510
00:44:26,161 --> 00:44:28,062
It could be less dangerous.

511
00:44:28,097 --> 00:44:29,239
And anyway, anything is better

512
00:44:29,263 --> 00:44:31,164
than staying down here
doing nothing.

513
00:44:59,689 --> 00:45:00,689
You should go.

514
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:03,625
Me?

515
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,231
What no, no, no, no.

516
00:45:05,266 --> 00:45:07,167
I have been against this
from the start.

517
00:45:07,202 --> 00:45:08,202
It has to be you.

518
00:45:09,237 --> 00:45:11,039
You need samples, right?

519
00:45:11,074 --> 00:45:12,744
To try to determine how
long we've been down here

520
00:45:12,768 --> 00:45:14,471
and figure out if the air
is safe?

521
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:15,506
Yeah.

522
00:45:16,805 --> 00:45:17,771
Can't somebody else do that?

523
00:45:17,806 --> 00:45:19,146
I will go.

524
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:21,346
You tell me what to-
No! Not you.

525
00:45:23,614 --> 00:45:24,614
You.

526
00:45:25,317 --> 00:45:27,418
You'll go first thing
in the morning.

527
00:45:41,269 --> 00:45:43,533
I don't know how much
more of this I can eat.

528
00:45:46,736 --> 00:45:49,473
As long as we're down
here, what choice do we have?

529
00:46:26,677 --> 00:46:30,415
Don't trust anything you see.

530
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,150
Hey, shh.

531
00:47:01,745 --> 00:47:03,316
You're all right.

532
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:06,319
It's me.

533
00:47:06,354 --> 00:47:07,386
What is it?

534
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:09,223
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

535
00:47:09,258 --> 00:47:12,787
I was just wondering if...
we could talk?

536
00:47:12,822 --> 00:47:14,723
Yeah, sure.

537
00:47:14,758 --> 00:47:16,098
Are you feeling better?

538
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,496
I'm all right.

539
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:21,763
Come with me.

540
00:47:29,608 --> 00:47:32,840
I told the others that
the soldier planted this.

541
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:36,382
I had to pin some kind of
evidence on him.

542
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:42,223
But I know it was you.

543
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:45,787
And I am grateful for
the true evidence

544
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:49,428
that you're still out there
and you're watching over us.

545
00:48:03,774 --> 00:48:08,645
We have had a few
unforeseen complications,

546
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,581
but don't worry.

547
00:48:10,616 --> 00:48:13,452
Nothing will stand in the
way of this experiment.

548
00:48:14,983 --> 00:48:20,228
I don't know if or when you'll
get this message, but.

549
00:48:23,497 --> 00:48:28,533
I know that you'll be back for
us, and I'll be here waiting.

550
00:48:33,705 --> 00:48:36,871
I'm gonna record the this,
if that's all right with you,

551
00:48:36,906 --> 00:48:37,906
for my research.

552
00:48:39,348 --> 00:48:41,381
We can count it as
your psychoanalysis.

553
00:48:42,747 --> 00:48:44,285
That's fine.

554
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,650
All right, let's just
start with the basics.

555
00:48:46,685 --> 00:48:47,685
What's your name?

556
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:53,789
I still don't remember, but
I'm certain I'm a physician.

557
00:48:56,563 --> 00:48:57,595
What about family?

558
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:02,600
I don't think I have any.

559
00:49:02,635 --> 00:49:06,274
I think my mother died
when I was a child.

560
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,278
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

561
00:49:10,313 --> 00:49:11,708
I lost my father to dementia.

562
00:49:17,452 --> 00:49:18,748
You remember your father?

563
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,291
Hardly.

564
00:49:23,524 --> 00:49:25,491
It was devastating when
his mind started slipping,

565
00:49:25,526 --> 00:49:28,692
he would just repeat everything,
verbatim.

566
00:49:30,366 --> 00:49:33,862
It's uncanny how preset
the brain is

567
00:49:33,897 --> 00:49:35,633
when you just strip it all away.

568
00:49:39,342 --> 00:49:41,342
I don't really remember much.

569
00:49:41,377 --> 00:49:42,508
What do you remember?

570
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:46,611
I remember volunteering
for this.

571
00:49:50,551 --> 00:49:52,518
I wanted my research to
mean something,

572
00:49:53,851 --> 00:49:54,916
to influence mankind.

573
00:49:56,557 --> 00:49:57,952
They picked only a few of us.

574
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,464
Cryo sleep was supposed to
open doors to space travel,

575
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:10,305
to slow aging, cure disease,
even help us to evolve.

576
00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:13,737
This was our chance to
unite the world

577
00:50:13,772 --> 00:50:16,036
through perfect preservation.

578
00:50:17,072 --> 00:50:20,843
The inventor asked us to
imagine the possibilities.

579
00:50:28,787 --> 00:50:29,918
But then we woke up.

580
00:50:32,395 --> 00:50:35,396
And now I'm sick, and frozen.

581
00:50:36,762 --> 00:50:38,696
And so I thought
we must have failed.

582
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:40,071
Doctor, I'm sure there's
still time.

583
00:50:40,095 --> 00:50:42,304
But then something
started happening,

584
00:50:43,637 --> 00:50:44,878
and I started to wonder
if maybe there's

585
00:50:44,902 --> 00:50:47,573
more to this than we thought.

586
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,571
Guys, I found the rats.

587
00:51:20,641 --> 00:51:22,135
I can run the experiments
on them!

588
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:24,137
I don't need to go outside.

589
00:51:29,177 --> 00:51:31,551
This is why I wanted
to talk to you.

590
00:51:31,586 --> 00:51:34,620
I keep hearing things,
I keep seeing visions,

591
00:51:34,655 --> 00:51:36,919
like I know what's going
to happen.

592
00:51:36,954 --> 00:51:37,954
We need to leave.

593
00:51:37,988 --> 00:51:39,053
Doctor.

594
00:51:39,088 --> 00:51:40,626
The engineer told us
not to trust

595
00:51:40,661 --> 00:51:41,803
the side effects of cryo sleep.

596
00:51:41,827 --> 00:51:42,892
No, it's more than that.

597
00:51:42,927 --> 00:51:44,498
I am telling you.

598
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:46,863
I'm sorry, but these
sound like hallucinations,

599
00:51:46,898 --> 00:51:48,029
night terrors.

600
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:49,701
You of anyone should
understand that.

601
00:51:49,736 --> 00:51:52,440
No, it is more than
that. Please listen to me.

602
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:55,872
I thought the experiment
was going to work.

603
00:51:55,907 --> 00:51:57,742
I didn't think it was going to.

604
00:51:59,515 --> 00:52:02,846
I didn't think it was
going to be like this.

605
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:08,688
Doctor?

606
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:15,628
What, what is it?

607
00:52:15,663 --> 00:52:16,663
It's time.

608
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,732
It's time.

609
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:23,131
Hello?

610
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:28,069
Everything okay in here?

611
00:52:29,138 --> 00:52:31,710
Yes, we'll be right there.

612
00:52:34,517 --> 00:52:35,517
All right.

613
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:55,569
Okay,

614
00:52:55,604 --> 00:52:58,033
once outside, stay within
range, and report everything.

615
00:52:59,608 --> 00:53:00,608
Yeah.

616
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,170
Okay.

617
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:21,892
A coward dies
a thousand deaths, friend.

618
00:54:17,653 --> 00:54:18,718
He's running.

619
00:54:18,753 --> 00:54:20,720
Kid's afraid of his own shadow.

620
00:54:20,755 --> 00:54:22,161
He'd run from anything.

621
00:54:22,185 --> 00:54:23,822
Hello?

622
00:54:23,857 --> 00:54:24,889
Are you still there?

623
00:54:27,256 --> 00:54:28,794
Hello?

624
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:30,697
Did we just send him
to his death?

625
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,969
Hey hey, look at me.

626
00:54:39,004 --> 00:54:40,938
Look at me, hey hey hey,
look at me.

627
00:54:40,973 --> 00:54:42,071
Look at me.

628
00:54:42,106 --> 00:54:43,809
What happened out there,
big guy?

629
00:54:45,076 --> 00:54:46,977
Please don't make me
go back out there.

630
00:54:47,012 --> 00:54:48,616
Why, what did you see?

631
00:54:49,916 --> 00:54:51,311
It's hot, it's unfamiliar...

632
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,623
It's not safe.

633
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,822
The air?

634
00:54:56,857 --> 00:54:57,857
Poisoned.

635
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:00,023
All of it.

636
00:55:00,058 --> 00:55:01,893
The whole world, we're...

637
00:55:02,896 --> 00:55:04,060
We're stuck down here.

638
00:55:05,932 --> 00:55:07,195
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

639
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,230
I tried.

640
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:10,067
I tried.

641
00:55:10,805 --> 00:55:11,805
I tried.

642
00:55:25,985 --> 00:55:27,017
I'm sorry.

643
00:55:30,957 --> 00:55:32,891
I have to get out of here.

644
00:55:36,424 --> 00:55:37,632
This isn't right.

645
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:41,702
We should have remembered
by now.

646
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:43,132
We're overlooking something.

647
00:55:44,201 --> 00:55:47,202
- The inventor would-
- The inventor is dead!

648
00:55:48,238 --> 00:55:50,370
There's no one coming for us!

649
00:55:52,946 --> 00:55:55,881
Why am I getting sicker
than the rest of you?

650
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:58,312
Everyone responds
differently to cryo sleep.

651
00:55:58,347 --> 00:55:59,918
No, no.

652
00:55:59,953 --> 00:56:03,152
So far, only she's
responded differently.

653
00:56:03,187 --> 00:56:04,197
You did something, didn't you?

654
00:56:04,221 --> 00:56:05,363
What are you talking about?

655
00:56:05,387 --> 00:56:07,156
To her cryo chamber,
to all of us.

656
00:56:07,191 --> 00:56:08,366
There's nothing wrong
with her chamber.

657
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:09,356
How do you know that?

658
00:56:09,391 --> 00:56:11,765
Because I built them.

659
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,975
Then why don't we
go have a look?

660
00:56:12,999 --> 00:56:14,207
- No, we don't...
- What aren't you.

661
00:56:14,231 --> 00:56:15,901
Enough!

662
00:56:15,936 --> 00:56:18,299
I've had enough outta you.

663
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:20,675
Would you two cut it out?

664
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,370
I am so sick of hearing
your egos go at it.

665
00:56:30,918 --> 00:56:31,918
You're right.

666
00:56:33,954 --> 00:56:34,954
I'm sorry.

667
00:56:39,388 --> 00:56:43,896
Hey. We're gonna figure
this out. Okay?

668
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:03,311
I'm going to bed.

669
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,077
Where'd you get that?

670
00:58:39,112 --> 00:58:40,540
Found it in the tool room.

671
00:58:40,575 --> 00:58:42,784
Thought we could use it
for protection.

672
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,083
What are you doing up?

673
00:58:45,118 --> 00:58:46,854
I could ask you the same thing.

674
00:58:51,322 --> 00:58:52,794
We're being watched.

675
00:58:53,962 --> 00:58:56,490
I'm positive this entire place
is bugged.

676
00:58:56,525 --> 00:58:59,031
Hidden cameras and
microphones everywhere.

677
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:02,034
You'd know something about that.

678
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:04,003
Communications and technology?

679
00:59:06,238 --> 00:59:08,436
You think you've got
everyone figured out.

680
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,208
But there's more going on here.

681
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,344
The engineer knows more than
he lets on.

682
00:59:15,379 --> 00:59:17,610
The biochemist stalks
around when he thinks

683
00:59:17,645 --> 00:59:19,183
no one is watching.

684
00:59:19,218 --> 00:59:23,220
And the doctor-
Is a sick, dying woman.

685
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:27,422
You know what, let's say
the air outside is poisoned,

686
00:59:27,457 --> 00:59:29,094
and someone snuck down here.

687
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,933
How do you think their body
would respond?

688
00:59:32,968 --> 00:59:34,176
Well, let's not forget
about you.

689
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,969
What about me?

690
00:59:36,004 --> 00:59:39,038
I know I heard a
gunshot that first night.

691
00:59:39,073 --> 00:59:41,975
Were you supposed to bring
a gun to this experiment?

692
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:44,472
And you can't have an arsenal,
which tells me you have what,

693
00:59:44,507 --> 00:59:46,012
a few bullets left?

694
00:59:47,015 --> 00:59:48,542
Maybe more if you came prepared.

695
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:53,547
We all have our secrets.

696
00:59:55,419 --> 00:59:56,616
You should be careful.

697
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:01,126
Good night, Soldier.

698
01:00:14,537 --> 01:00:17,912
Would you state your name
to camera?

699
01:00:19,542 --> 01:00:21,113
I wish I could.

700
01:00:22,215 --> 01:00:24,611
Why is the doctor freezing
to death?

701
01:00:27,121 --> 01:00:29,352
Do you ask everyone that?

702
01:00:31,455 --> 01:00:33,928
Cryogenesis is causing
some anomalous form

703
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,062
of hypothermia
and hallucinations.

704
01:00:37,395 --> 01:00:39,395
I saw you tampering
with her chamber.

705
01:00:58,449 --> 01:01:00,713
There is a problem with
her chamber, all right?

706
01:01:00,748 --> 01:01:02,627
There was a power problem
that somehow disrupted

707
01:01:02,651 --> 01:01:05,190
the physiochemical
thawing process.

708
01:01:05,225 --> 01:01:06,191
What's happening?

709
01:01:06,226 --> 01:01:07,654
Why didn't you say anything?

710
01:01:07,689 --> 01:01:09,238
I was waiting for the
imposter to reveal them self.

711
01:01:09,262 --> 01:01:11,295
I mean, somebody's here
trying to pick us off,

712
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:12,725
kill the inventor.

713
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,408
You seem to think the
inventor is still coming.

714
01:01:14,432 --> 01:01:16,069
I mean, but there was
all that blood.

715
01:01:16,104 --> 01:01:17,642
It belonged, obviously,
to somebody on this team,

716
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:19,974
I mean, the imposter could
have disposed of the body

717
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,580
and then jumped into
one of the cryo chambers

718
01:01:21,604 --> 01:01:22,669
and then woke up with us.

719
01:01:22,704 --> 01:01:23,978
It could be the doctor!

720
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,474
The inventor foresaw
all of this,

721
01:01:25,509 --> 01:01:27,476
and he'll reveal himself
when the time is right.

722
01:01:27,511 --> 01:01:30,149
So until that time, I
will act as his voice!

723
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,426
You remember a lot about
the inventor.

724
01:01:43,461 --> 01:01:45,362
What did he look like?

725
01:01:45,397 --> 01:01:46,528
He, uhh...

726
01:01:46,563 --> 01:01:48,431
Do you know how old he is,
his race?

727
01:01:49,566 --> 01:01:50,763
The details are.

728
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:53,304
Are you sure the inventor
is even a man?

729
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:59,211
Did you know that
the doctor thinks

730
01:01:59,246 --> 01:02:01,114
she can see the future now?

731
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:06,647
Maybe cryo sleep is taking
more than our memories.

732
01:02:07,518 --> 01:02:11,388
What if the inventor
lost his way?

733
01:02:29,342 --> 01:02:32,112
The inventor will return.

734
01:02:32,147 --> 01:02:34,081
And he'll tell us who to trust.

735
01:02:34,116 --> 01:02:35,709
And he'll take us
to a safe haven,

736
01:02:37,548 --> 01:02:39,053
even the ninth sphere.

737
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:04,600
What's going on?

738
01:04:04,635 --> 01:04:07,867
Someone stole more food.

739
01:04:07,902 --> 01:04:10,441
Someone meaning someone here.

740
01:04:11,774 --> 01:04:12,641
Whatever.

741
01:04:12,676 --> 01:04:13,840
It may not matter now.

742
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,479
I have a solution.

743
01:04:15,514 --> 01:04:16,579
Of course you do.

744
01:04:36,931 --> 01:04:39,338
0, 0, 9.

745
01:04:39,373 --> 01:04:40,867
The ninth sphere.

746
01:04:40,902 --> 01:04:43,375
That's what the inventor
always talked about, right?

747
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:50,646
I thought...

748
01:04:50,681 --> 01:04:52,516
All right, no one
else touches the keypad.

749
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,721
What are you doing?

750
01:04:59,756 --> 01:05:01,195
I just wanted to see the sun.

751
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,725
No, it's poisonous out there!

752
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:04,858
Remember?

753
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,928
Why don't you come back
down here...

754
01:05:10,965 --> 01:05:12,404
Where it's safe?

755
01:05:24,715 --> 01:05:27,419
Does someone want to explain

756
01:05:27,454 --> 01:05:30,257
why our food keeps disappearing?

757
01:05:34,021 --> 01:05:36,461
The killer could be
trying to starve us out.

758
01:05:36,496 --> 01:05:37,759
Yeah.

759
01:05:37,794 --> 01:05:39,497
That a military tactic?

760
01:05:39,532 --> 01:05:41,928
Someone here is not
telling to truth!

761
01:05:41,963 --> 01:05:43,864
Please, just calm down.

762
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:46,603
I'm sick of being calm!

763
01:05:49,575 --> 01:05:53,280
And just how sick are you,
Doctor?

764
01:05:53,315 --> 01:05:54,743
Huh, what is your diagnosis?

765
01:05:54,778 --> 01:05:58,219
Because I thought sick
people don't want to eat.

766
01:06:00,355 --> 01:06:02,487
I have been so cold
and so hungry.

767
01:06:02,522 --> 01:06:03,818
We're all hungry!

768
01:06:03,853 --> 01:06:05,985
- Don't yell at her!
- Doctor.

769
01:06:06,889 --> 01:06:07,889
You're dying.

770
01:06:09,364 --> 01:06:10,858
Don't drag us down with you.

771
01:06:16,338 --> 01:06:17,469
I'm sorry.

772
01:06:17,504 --> 01:06:19,702
Sorry is not gonna
cut it this time.

773
01:06:19,737 --> 01:06:21,033
Let's just hear her out.

774
01:06:21,068 --> 01:06:23,607
No, there's no talking
your way outta this!

775
01:06:24,544 --> 01:06:26,940
Did you eat the food or not?

776
01:06:26,975 --> 01:06:27,975
I did it.

777
01:06:35,555 --> 01:06:36,785
You did what?

778
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,400
I saw her take it.

779
01:06:48,535 --> 01:06:50,304
But she needs it.

780
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:51,437
She really is sick.

781
01:06:51,472 --> 01:06:53,406
I guess that settles it, huh?

782
01:06:53,441 --> 01:06:55,001
Come here!

783
01:06:55,036 --> 01:06:56,970
Leave her alone!

784
01:06:57,005 --> 01:06:58,609
Can't you see that
she's suffering.

785
01:06:58,644 --> 01:07:01,007
We all just need to calm down.

786
01:07:01,944 --> 01:07:03,614
All right, the key is
in our memories,

787
01:07:03,649 --> 01:07:05,847
if we can just remember.

788
01:07:05,882 --> 01:07:06,882
This again!

789
01:07:06,916 --> 01:07:09,422
What is keeping you so calm?

790
01:07:09,457 --> 01:07:11,886
You don't seem to be
afraid of dying down here.

791
01:07:11,921 --> 01:07:15,021
How do you always have
all the answers?

792
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:19,927
You're telling every single
one of us what to do.

793
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:24,900
Well?

794
01:07:29,675 --> 01:07:30,938
No.

795
01:07:30,973 --> 01:07:31,939
No!

796
01:07:31,974 --> 01:07:33,578
I'm not going out like this!

797
01:07:33,613 --> 01:07:35,844
I'm not about to
starve to death!

798
01:07:46,692 --> 01:07:47,955
Stay away from me.

799
01:07:53,831 --> 01:07:54,962
Where are you going?

800
01:07:58,935 --> 01:07:59,935
To lie down.

801
01:07:59,969 --> 01:08:03,773
Don't steal from us again.

802
01:08:03,808 --> 01:08:04,873
She won't.

803
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:08,449
Sure she will.

804
01:08:11,849 --> 01:08:13,115
People never change.

805
01:08:22,926 --> 01:08:24,123
How are you feeling?

806
01:08:33,541 --> 01:08:34,541
Hey.

807
01:08:37,974 --> 01:08:39,171
Hey!

808
01:08:39,206 --> 01:08:41,613
Why did you sign up for this?

809
01:08:41,648 --> 01:08:42,812
I wanted to last.

810
01:08:44,013 --> 01:08:47,113
I just love the idea
of permanence.

811
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:03,635
I've been doing some of
my best work on your cells

812
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:05,164
to try to identify the problem.

813
01:09:06,673 --> 01:09:09,707
Unfortunately, prognosis isn't
really my area of expertise.

814
01:09:09,742 --> 01:09:10,708
My cells?

815
01:09:10,743 --> 01:09:11,823
Where did you get my cells?

816
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,780
I'm sorry.

817
01:09:16,815 --> 01:09:17,847
I probably forgot.

818
01:09:19,081 --> 01:09:20,751
Everything's drifting
in and out.

819
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:24,722
It's like there's a tug of
war going on inside my head.

820
01:09:26,528 --> 01:09:29,727
And part of me keeps
getting more and more lost.

821
01:09:31,159 --> 01:09:33,192
Nothing is making any sense.

822
01:09:34,899 --> 01:09:38,538
And I am so cold.

823
01:09:44,073 --> 01:09:45,479
Doctor, your hand.

824
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:00,527
We have to move out of the
past to remember the future.

825
01:10:00,562 --> 01:10:01,594
We have to wake up.

826
01:10:01,629 --> 01:10:03,189
We already woke up.

827
01:10:03,224 --> 01:10:04,224
Remember?

828
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,600
Guys, help, I think she's
hallucinating again.

829
01:10:07,635 --> 01:10:08,766
- What is it?
- I don't know,

830
01:10:08,801 --> 01:10:10,603
she just started ramping
off nonsense.

831
01:10:10,638 --> 01:10:11,934
No, no, I remember.

832
01:10:13,707 --> 01:10:14,970
Oh God, I'm sorry.

833
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:17,511
I'm in hell.

834
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:26,817
This isn't the ninth circle
of heaven.

835
01:10:28,689 --> 01:10:30,117
It's the ninth circle of hell.

836
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,565
The frozen lake.

837
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:51,238
Hey guys.

838
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:54,010
Guys!

839
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,967
Where is he now?

840
01:11:40,321 --> 01:11:41,892
I want the truth, who are you?

841
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:43,124
What are you doing?

842
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:44,799
What did you do to
the real number four?

843
01:11:47,702 --> 01:11:49,834
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

844
01:11:49,869 --> 01:11:52,606
- Oh, you don't?
- Back. Off.

845
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,069
I knew it.

846
01:11:54,104 --> 01:11:55,675
I knew it was you.

847
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:57,974
It was next to my cryo
chamber when I woke up.

848
01:11:58,009 --> 01:11:59,712
Who are you?

849
01:11:59,747 --> 01:12:01,692
I'm a military communications
and defense specialist,

850
01:12:01,716 --> 01:12:03,914
which is why I have a gun.

851
01:12:03,949 --> 01:12:06,048
Here testing cryo sleep.

852
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:08,655
Hand over the gun
and let's find out.

853
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:10,184
You're not laying
a finger on me.

854
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:11,724
What did you do to the inventor?

855
01:12:11,759 --> 01:12:14,661
I have never seen your
ridiculous inventor!

856
01:12:14,696 --> 01:12:15,827
If he's even real.

857
01:12:17,259 --> 01:12:18,192
He's real.

858
01:12:18,227 --> 01:12:19,864
He's as real as any of us.

859
01:12:19,899 --> 01:12:23,296
- Soldier?
- I am who I say I am.

860
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:28,136
From now, on you stay
away from me.

861
01:12:32,109 --> 01:12:34,747
I say we lock him outside,
unless he hands over the gun

862
01:12:34,782 --> 01:12:36,815
and tells us what he
did with the inventor.

863
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:37,948
That would kill him.

864
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:38,817
I don't think that's
a good idea.

865
01:12:38,852 --> 01:12:39,983
Why the hell not?

866
01:12:40,018 --> 01:12:41,424
I mean, the air will
kill him, right?

867
01:12:41,448 --> 01:12:42,282
There's still a chance
that he could get back in,

868
01:12:42,317 --> 01:12:43,690
unless we 100% sure.

869
01:12:43,725 --> 01:12:44,988
Enough!

870
01:12:45,023 --> 01:12:47,419
Okay, this is a risk
we have to take.

871
01:12:47,454 --> 01:12:48,794
Maybe we could talk to him.

872
01:12:48,829 --> 01:12:50,191
Hell no, that's...

873
01:12:50,226 --> 01:12:51,863
Look, the guy's a loose cannon,
okay?

874
01:12:51,898 --> 01:12:53,865
Reasoning with him, that's over.

875
01:12:55,132 --> 01:12:56,132
Wait.

876
01:12:59,433 --> 01:13:00,433
Doctor?

877
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:19,253
Wait, wait, no, wait, please.

878
01:13:19,288 --> 01:13:20,288
Wait.

879
01:13:22,423 --> 01:13:23,697
I need your help.

880
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:24,863
What do you want?

881
01:13:24,898 --> 01:13:25,898
It's the doctor.

882
01:13:27,067 --> 01:13:29,901
She's had a seizure and she
needs electroconvulsive therapy.

883
01:13:31,806 --> 01:13:33,806
You can make something for that,
right?

884
01:13:36,173 --> 01:13:37,810
I thought I was the bad guy.

885
01:13:39,847 --> 01:13:41,407
Everyone else seems to think so.

886
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,379
They're gonna try to
take your gun.

887
01:13:48,284 --> 01:13:51,824
But if you help me, you
can prove your innocence.

888
01:13:54,455 --> 01:13:55,455
Where is she?

889
01:13:56,226 --> 01:13:57,226
I'll show you.

890
01:14:16,345 --> 01:14:17,916
Get off of me!

891
01:14:17,951 --> 01:14:18,884
Help me!

892
01:14:18,919 --> 01:14:19,919
Help!

893
01:14:21,317 --> 01:14:23,757
Go find the gun!

894
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,187
No, no no no!

895
01:14:25,222 --> 01:14:26,222
No!

896
01:14:54,856 --> 01:14:55,856
Where's the gun?

897
01:15:15,437 --> 01:15:16,535
Self analysis.

898
01:15:18,308 --> 01:15:22,442
Today is day four since
waking from cryo sleep.

899
01:15:22,477 --> 01:15:24,279
I'm a psychologist.

900
01:15:24,314 --> 01:15:25,412
I don't remember much.

901
01:15:26,415 --> 01:15:27,854
Images mostly.

902
01:15:28,615 --> 01:15:32,991
My dad's dementia, climbing
into a cryo chamber.

903
01:15:34,962 --> 01:15:36,390
I don't even know my own name.

904
01:15:39,164 --> 01:15:40,262
I need to remember.

905
01:15:44,235 --> 01:15:47,973
After the doctor got
sick, she voiced concerns

906
01:15:48,008 --> 01:15:50,107
that this experiment
was a failure,

907
01:15:50,142 --> 01:15:52,109
and I'm worried that
she may be right.

908
01:15:53,112 --> 01:15:58,115
I'm developing similar symptoms,
visions... hallucinations.

909
01:16:00,086 --> 01:16:03,054
But she said something
that I just can't shake,

910
01:16:03,089 --> 01:16:05,584
that there may be more
to this than we thought.

911
01:16:08,325 --> 01:16:10,490
I don't know if we're
doing the right thing.

912
01:16:11,592 --> 01:16:14,934
But I believe that the
answers are in our memories.

913
01:17:15,392 --> 01:17:16,523
Are you okay?

914
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:23,399
You were right.

915
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:27,974
We should have stayed calm.

916
01:17:31,342 --> 01:17:32,539
I didn't know.

917
01:17:32,574 --> 01:17:35,146
It was always gonna play out
like this.

918
01:17:39,614 --> 01:17:41,185
Go.

919
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:42,220
You should go.

920
01:18:09,578 --> 01:18:11,380
What are you doing?

921
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,516
I was just listening for
her heartbeat.

922
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,551
She won't wake.

923
01:18:19,654 --> 01:18:20,654
Doctor.

924
01:18:21,491 --> 01:18:22,589
Doctor, come on.

925
01:18:22,624 --> 01:18:23,624
Hey hey hey.

926
01:18:25,297 --> 01:18:28,100
The inventor would've known
what to do.

927
01:18:28,135 --> 01:18:29,530
So he really is gone, then.

928
01:18:30,401 --> 01:18:32,500
It's like her body wants
to stay frozen.

929
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:34,634
Well, I don't know.

930
01:18:35,837 --> 01:18:39,078
I mean, she could get better,
she looks okay right now.

931
01:18:39,113 --> 01:18:40,113
No, wait a minute.

932
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,016
Wait yes, that could work,
actually.

933
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:44,182
What?

934
01:18:44,217 --> 01:18:45,392
What if the thing
that's killing her

935
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:47,482
could be the thing that
could save her?

936
01:18:47,517 --> 01:18:49,715
I mean, they're supposed
to heal you, right?

937
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:50,790
What are you suggesting?

938
01:18:50,817 --> 01:18:52,058
That we her back in?

939
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,721
It could possibly stop
what's happening to her.

940
01:18:55,756 --> 01:18:57,294
Give her more time.

941
01:18:57,329 --> 01:18:59,329
Maybe even be like
a reset button.

942
01:19:00,332 --> 01:19:03,300
The only sure chance
of survival.

943
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:13,574
- What the-
- Stay back!

944
01:19:13,609 --> 01:19:14,641
I don't want trouble.

945
01:19:14,676 --> 01:19:16,148
What do you want?

946
01:19:16,183 --> 01:19:18,381
I just want outta here.

947
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:20,350
You want outta here?

948
01:19:20,385 --> 01:19:22,121
All right.

949
01:19:22,156 --> 01:19:23,156
Let's go.

950
01:19:32,793 --> 01:19:34,694
Go on, leave.

951
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:36,168
What?

952
01:19:36,203 --> 01:19:38,764
You wanted outta here,
there's the door.

953
01:19:38,799 --> 01:19:40,304
He'll die out there.

954
01:19:40,339 --> 01:19:42,108
Better than him killing
us while we sleep.

955
01:19:43,705 --> 01:19:44,705
Go!

956
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:47,740
Okay, okay.

957
01:19:47,775 --> 01:19:50,512
Just tell us where the gun
is and maybe

958
01:19:50,547 --> 01:19:51,678
we can work something out.

959
01:19:51,713 --> 01:19:53,130
I'll tell you what's gonna
work out.

960
01:19:53,154 --> 01:19:54,494
You're gonna go out that
door right there.

961
01:19:54,518 --> 01:19:56,089
'Cause if you come down
those stairs,

962
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:57,750
I'm gonna cut you
into little pieces.

963
01:19:57,785 --> 01:19:59,158
You can't be serious.

964
01:20:03,527 --> 01:20:04,527
It's okay.

965
01:20:06,662 --> 01:20:08,200
I'll take my chances.

966
01:20:12,338 --> 01:20:14,074
People are predictable.

967
01:20:53,676 --> 01:20:55,412
Why did you do that?

968
01:20:57,647 --> 01:20:58,789
Why did I just save our lives?

969
01:20:58,813 --> 01:20:59,911
- Guys.
- You killed him.

970
01:20:59,946 --> 01:21:01,649
Guys.

971
01:21:01,684 --> 01:21:02,684
The doctor?

972
01:22:09,752 --> 01:22:12,918
The machete,
I left it right here.

973
01:22:13,987 --> 01:22:15,360
None of us took it.

974
01:22:15,395 --> 01:22:17,527
We've been together all morning.

975
01:22:17,562 --> 01:22:18,891
Someone had to.

976
01:22:18,926 --> 01:22:21,531
Okay, wait, wait, what
does that mean, then?

977
01:22:21,566 --> 01:22:22,895
The soldier.

978
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:24,336
Impossible.

979
01:22:24,371 --> 01:22:25,909
The air's toxic,
so he's he's dead, right?

980
01:22:25,933 --> 01:22:27,933
- Right?
- Yes, yes, the air's toxic.

981
01:22:28,837 --> 01:22:30,672
Then it has to be somebody else.

982
01:22:30,707 --> 01:22:32,806
Okay, well, what about
the photograph

983
01:22:32,841 --> 01:22:34,247
and the missing numbers?

984
01:22:35,382 --> 01:22:36,447
It's a red herring.

985
01:22:39,551 --> 01:22:41,749
One of you are not who
you say you are.

986
01:22:41,784 --> 01:22:42,750
Hold on a second.

987
01:22:42,785 --> 01:22:43,982
The same can be true of you.

988
01:22:44,017 --> 01:22:45,918
Okay, so we just killed
an innocent man?

989
01:22:45,953 --> 01:22:47,887
No, no, he's still guilty.

990
01:22:50,826 --> 01:22:52,023
Just like one of you are.

991
01:22:52,058 --> 01:22:53,761
Hold on.

992
01:22:53,796 --> 01:22:56,401
There's still the option that
someone else is down here.

993
01:22:56,436 --> 01:22:57,436
All right.

994
01:22:58,305 --> 01:23:01,901
Then from now on, no
one goes anywhere alone.

995
01:23:22,957 --> 01:23:24,506
It will be as
though you've passed through

996
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:26,332
a veil of forgetfulness.

997
01:23:27,599 --> 01:23:28,906
Our memories are gonna
come back.

998
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:30,666
I still don't remember.

999
01:23:30,701 --> 01:23:32,404
I just wanna know my own name.

1000
01:23:32,439 --> 01:23:34,406
Why don't I remember my name?

1001
01:23:34,441 --> 01:23:35,583
You still don't remember
your name?

1002
01:23:35,607 --> 01:23:37,409
Let me know when you do.

1003
01:23:37,444 --> 01:23:38,971
Is it from cryo sleep?

1004
01:23:39,006 --> 01:23:40,742
Why haven't our memories
come back yet?

1005
01:23:40,777 --> 01:23:42,678
- They'll come.
- I am who I say I am.

1006
01:23:44,385 --> 01:23:46,715
Maybe there's more to
this than we thought.

1007
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:49,718
They key is in our memories,
if we can just remember.

1008
01:23:49,753 --> 01:23:51,390
You must remember.

1009
01:24:20,685 --> 01:24:23,081
I see no one has
killed each other... yet.

1010
01:24:23,952 --> 01:24:25,688
It's because we're not killers.

1011
01:24:37,471 --> 01:24:38,471
I remember.

1012
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,100
Your name?

1013
01:24:44,742 --> 01:24:47,039
This test,
this whole experiment,

1014
01:24:47,074 --> 01:24:49,041
it's not what we thought it was.

1015
01:24:49,076 --> 01:24:51,120
Shit, it's happening to her
too. Are you feeling okay?

1016
01:24:51,144 --> 01:24:53,485
Would you shut up
and listen to me?

1017
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,817
This test was never to
see if cryo sleep works.

1018
01:24:55,852 --> 01:24:56,818
Of course it was.

1019
01:24:56,853 --> 01:24:57,588
What are you talking about?

1020
01:24:57,623 --> 01:24:58,985
No.

1021
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:02,395
This test was meant for
us to test our memories.

1022
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:03,924
Okay.

1023
01:25:03,959 --> 01:25:05,530
You've been saying that
from the start.

1024
01:25:05,565 --> 01:25:06,630
And now I know why.

1025
01:25:07,798 --> 01:25:09,765
Because that was our objective.

1026
01:25:11,472 --> 01:25:14,440
I don't know, the
inventor, he wouldn't have...

1027
01:25:14,475 --> 01:25:16,167
No, I know that's not
what we were told.

1028
01:25:16,202 --> 01:25:17,839
Why would he wanna
test our memories?

1029
01:25:17,874 --> 01:25:19,808
Because cryo sleep is worthless

1030
01:25:19,843 --> 01:25:22,107
if we don't remember who
we are when we wake up.

1031
01:25:22,142 --> 01:25:23,779
I don't believe that.

1032
01:25:23,814 --> 01:25:24,648
I was there.

1033
01:25:24,683 --> 01:25:26,485
There was a plan.

1034
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:28,586
Okay, I helped build those
cryo chambers, all right?

1035
01:25:28,621 --> 01:25:31,457
And the inventor was my friend.

1036
01:25:31,492 --> 01:25:33,118
He would not have
lied to me, okay?

1037
01:25:33,153 --> 01:25:36,022
He wouldn't have turned me
into a lab rat!

1038
01:25:36,057 --> 01:25:37,672
Then why haven't our
memories come back yet?

1039
01:25:37,696 --> 01:25:38,530
I don't know!

1040
01:25:38,565 --> 01:25:40,059
Maybe she's right.

1041
01:25:40,094 --> 01:25:42,699
If the brain doesn't receive
enough oxygen, then memory,

1042
01:25:42,734 --> 01:25:44,503
- it breaks down, it fails.
- Okay.

1043
01:25:45,935 --> 01:25:48,540
We all wake up at the same time?

1044
01:25:48,575 --> 01:25:49,684
And that microphone you found?

1045
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:51,873
We're being recorded, studied.

1046
01:25:51,908 --> 01:25:53,204
I don't believe that.

1047
01:25:53,239 --> 01:25:54,239
Okay.

1048
01:25:55,342 --> 01:25:58,847
Well maybe everyone's dead,
or maybe we're being hunted,

1049
01:25:58,882 --> 01:26:00,486
but for right now,
it's all we've got.

1050
01:26:00,521 --> 01:26:02,884
And how do you suggest
that we bootstrap memory?

1051
01:26:12,192 --> 01:26:15,897
I hope this idea of yours works.

1052
01:26:15,932 --> 01:26:16,997
What do I do?

1053
01:26:18,539 --> 01:26:20,770
Okay, first thing, you
wanna tighten that down

1054
01:26:20,805 --> 01:26:22,167
as hard as you can.

1055
01:26:22,202 --> 01:26:24,169
The tighter it is,
higher the pressure,

1056
01:26:24,204 --> 01:26:25,841
the faster the flow of oxygen.

1057
01:26:27,647 --> 01:26:29,020
Next thing is you're
gonna wear this.

1058
01:26:29,044 --> 01:26:31,946
You ever worn
one of these before?

1059
01:26:40,858 --> 01:26:42,088
What are you doing?

1060
01:26:42,123 --> 01:26:43,727
I was...

1061
01:26:43,762 --> 01:26:44,762
Nothing.

1062
01:26:44,796 --> 01:26:45,894
It's ready.

1063
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:56,070
Fine.

1064
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:12,657
You okay?

1065
01:27:20,161 --> 01:27:23,261
I'm gonna start the flow
of oxygen.

1066
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:37,650
Anything?

1067
01:27:39,213 --> 01:27:41,213
Okay, I'm gonna increase
the pressure.

1068
01:27:41,248 --> 01:27:42,852
Do it.

1069
01:27:42,887 --> 01:27:43,887
You sure?

1070
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:49,254
Stop it!

1071
01:27:49,289 --> 01:27:50,289
Stop it, turn it off!

1072
01:27:52,864 --> 01:27:54,798
You all right?

1073
01:27:54,833 --> 01:27:56,195
It didn't work.

1074
01:27:57,132 --> 01:27:58,132
I'm sorry.

1075
01:28:00,069 --> 01:28:01,266
The doctor.

1076
01:28:02,137 --> 01:28:03,202
I was careless.

1077
01:28:08,748 --> 01:28:10,748
It is my fault.

1078
01:28:10,783 --> 01:28:13,553
If she leaves that chamber,
she'll die.

1079
01:28:18,692 --> 01:28:19,692
I'm sorry.

1080
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:23,893
I didn't wanna remember.

1081
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,605
Hey, you okay?

1082
01:28:34,202 --> 01:28:36,609
- Where is she?!
- What are you doing?

1083
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:38,655
What are we still doing here?!

1084
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:39,777
What do you mean?

1085
01:28:39,812 --> 01:28:41,746
You little bitch!

1086
01:28:41,781 --> 01:28:43,275
Why did you let this happen?

1087
01:28:49,151 --> 01:28:50,216
Where are you?!

1088
01:28:54,893 --> 01:28:58,026
This merry-go-round ends now!

1089
01:29:03,132 --> 01:29:05,033
Open the chamber, quick!

1090
01:29:20,754 --> 01:29:21,754
Why?

1091
01:29:41,742 --> 01:29:43,335
No, don't do this!

1092
01:29:43,370 --> 01:29:46,206
We're lab rats,
this is all a lie!

1093
01:29:46,241 --> 01:29:47,405
No, don't, no!

1094
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:04,830
You're alive.

1095
01:30:04,864 --> 01:30:05,864
It's okay.

1096
01:30:05,898 --> 01:30:07,227
I'm gonna get us out of here.

1097
01:30:07,262 --> 01:30:08,262
The air.

1098
01:30:08,296 --> 01:30:09,834
No, the air outside is fine.

1099
01:30:10,837 --> 01:30:12,870
No...'Cause that means that...

1100
01:30:57,279 --> 01:30:58,718
Don't you see?

1101
01:31:00,216 --> 01:31:02,887
This is the only way
that the doctor survives.

1102
01:31:02,922 --> 01:31:05,153
He was trying to save her!

1103
01:31:07,025 --> 01:31:09,289
I'm tired of being a pawn.

1104
01:31:13,196 --> 01:31:16,329
I decide what happens
to the doctor now.

1105
01:31:19,037 --> 01:31:21,807
She's beautiful in there.

1106
01:31:23,206 --> 01:31:25,239
Perfectly preserved.

1107
01:31:25,274 --> 01:31:27,043
You're out of your mind!

1108
01:31:31,016 --> 01:31:32,785
Well, maybe we should
have figured that out

1109
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,446
during my psychoanalysis.

1110
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:25,167
There's nowhere to go!

1111
01:32:25,202 --> 01:32:27,400
0-0-2!

1112
01:33:00,072 --> 01:33:01,072
Hey, hey.

1113
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:09,145
Hey, I'm gonna get you
outta here.

1114
01:33:11,248 --> 01:33:13,083
No, you're not.

1115
01:33:13,118 --> 01:33:14,118
Where's the gun?

1116
01:33:15,153 --> 01:33:16,350
Where's the gun?

1117
01:33:16,385 --> 01:33:17,890
Please, please, please.

1118
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:19,287
I need to know where the gun is.

1119
01:33:20,521 --> 01:33:21,521
Go to hell.

1120
01:33:29,332 --> 01:33:31,431
I knew I'd find you here.

1121
01:33:31,466 --> 01:33:32,905
No, no, no!

1122
01:33:41,047 --> 01:33:42,145
He can't save you.

1123
01:34:13,442 --> 01:34:14,276
Stay back!

1124
01:34:14,311 --> 01:34:15,640
Wait, stop, stop.

1125
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:18,710
Fine!

1126
01:34:21,615 --> 01:34:22,615
You win.

1127
01:34:25,223 --> 01:34:27,586
You can have the doctor.

1128
01:34:30,294 --> 01:34:32,261
Just leave me in peace.

1129
01:34:46,112 --> 01:34:47,112
Don't worry.

1130
01:35:12,204 --> 01:35:14,039
I've thought it all out.

1131
01:35:15,603 --> 01:35:18,208
There are just
too many variables.

1132
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:23,411
This is the only sure
chance of survival.

1133
01:35:25,415 --> 01:35:26,579
100%.

1134
01:36:35,452 --> 01:36:36,452
You're dying.

1135
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:38,850
We all die.

1136
01:36:40,787 --> 01:36:42,556
No, you don't.

1137
01:37:21,696 --> 01:37:22,827
I'm truly sorry.

1138
01:38:27,399 --> 01:38:28,399
I failed.

1139
01:38:29,764 --> 01:38:30,764
I failed.

1140
01:41:45,058 --> 01:41:46,058
I remember.

1141
01:41:47,126 --> 01:41:48,126
I remember.

1142
01:41:52,835 --> 01:41:54,703
- Dad, it's me.
- It's you.

1143
01:41:54,738 --> 01:41:55,935
Yes, it's you.

1144
01:41:55,970 --> 01:41:57,508
It's you, isn't it?

1145
01:41:57,543 --> 01:41:58,806
Yes, it is, I remember.

1146
01:42:01,206 --> 01:42:04,009
My memories, it worked,
didn't it?

1147
01:42:05,177 --> 01:42:06,913
Yes, yes.

1148
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:14,624
Now we have to be absolutely
certain for the next test.

1149
01:42:14,659 --> 01:42:16,890
The one with a larger
sample size.

1150
01:42:18,828 --> 01:42:19,662
What, the next test?

1151
01:42:19,697 --> 01:42:21,092
Yes, yes.

1152
01:42:21,127 --> 01:42:22,643
I've assembled a team with
everything you'll need.

1153
01:42:22,667 --> 01:42:25,701
They should be in
their chambers now.

1154
01:42:29,872 --> 01:42:34,512
I had to be certain that
my mind had returned.

1155
01:42:34,547 --> 01:42:35,887
No, we already performed
the test.

1156
01:42:35,911 --> 01:42:37,713
Or I'll just turn off
their chambers.

1157
01:42:38,584 --> 01:42:39,781
That would kill them.

1158
01:42:39,816 --> 01:42:41,112
Yes.

1159
01:42:41,147 --> 01:42:44,951
Yes it will, but it's
better that they die

1160
01:42:45,921 --> 01:42:47,019
than dwindle on.

1161
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:54,092
Are you ready to begin?

1162
01:43:21,055 --> 01:43:23,253
They are preserved
for a wise purpose,

1163
01:43:23,288 --> 01:43:26,091
which purpose is known unto God,

1164
01:43:26,126 --> 01:43:29,160
and God's course is
one eternal round.

1165
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:33,263
Tell me a story about yourself.

1166
01:43:33,298 --> 01:43:36,475
Do you know the first
Bible story I heard as a boy?

1167
01:43:37,973 --> 01:43:40,072
Lazarus, raised from the dead.

1168
01:43:41,977 --> 01:43:46,111
After that, I always wished
I could bring back Mother.

1169
01:43:48,016 --> 01:43:49,488
Of course, that never happened.

1170
01:43:51,019 --> 01:43:55,252
But I'll always remember
those first embers of hope,

1171
01:43:56,761 --> 01:43:58,057
that maybe someone could.

1172
01:44:00,226 --> 01:44:01,797
Good.

1173
01:44:01,832 --> 01:44:03,293
And what are you.

1174
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:05,801
Do you know the first
Bible story I heard as a boy?

1175
01:44:07,068 --> 01:44:09,541
It was Lazarus,
raised from the dead.

1176
01:44:11,171 --> 01:44:15,547
After that, I always wished
I could bring back Mother.

1177
01:44:16,649 --> 01:44:18,682
Of course, that never happened.

1178
01:44:18,717 --> 01:44:23,016
But I'll always remember
those first embers of hope.

1179
01:44:24,723 --> 01:44:27,086
Maybe someday, someone could.

1180
01:44:29,761 --> 01:44:31,090
Good.

1181
01:44:31,125 --> 01:44:32,125
Okay.

1182
01:44:33,028 --> 01:44:34,896
All right, let's just
start with the basics.

1183
01:44:34,931 --> 01:44:38,933
Do you know the first
Bible story I heard as a boy?

1184
01:44:38,968 --> 01:44:42,035
It was Lazarus,
raised from the dead.

1185
01:44:43,676 --> 01:44:46,578
After I heard that,
I always wished.

1186
01:44:48,043 --> 01:44:52,815
I could bring back Mother,
but of course never happened.

1187
01:44:54,819 --> 01:44:59,118
I'll always remember the
first dying embers of hope.

1188
01:45:01,628 --> 01:45:03,694
Perhaps someday somebody could.

1189
01:45:05,929 --> 01:45:09,799
Do you know the first Bible
story I heard as a boy?

1190
01:45:19,272 --> 01:45:20,843
If you're watching this...

1191
01:45:27,819 --> 01:45:29,951
You should know the
experiment didn't work.

1192
01:45:55,440 --> 01:46:00,344
If you're watching this,
the experiment didn't work.

1193
01:46:06,154 --> 01:46:07,318
So I'm gonna try it again.

1194
01:46:09,124 --> 01:46:10,354
I can't let the team die.

1195
01:46:12,094 --> 01:46:13,159
I can make this work.

1196
01:46:16,131 --> 01:46:17,834
I can cure my dad.

1197
01:46:17,869 --> 01:46:19,000
I can still remember.

1198
01:46:20,465 --> 01:46:22,366
But I'm gonna take
a few precautions.

1199
01:46:24,106 --> 01:46:26,337
It's entirely possible
that if we don't remember

1200
01:46:26,372 --> 01:46:27,778
this next time...

1201
01:46:29,947 --> 01:46:32,376
Every event will unfold
in a similar manner.

1202
01:46:36,888 --> 01:46:39,383
People are always
making the same choices,

1203
01:46:41,057 --> 01:46:43,959
the same mistakes.

1204
01:46:43,994 --> 01:46:46,698
Like they're just pre-wired
like that.

1205
01:46:46,733 --> 01:46:48,161
Why are we doing this again?

1206
01:46:48,196 --> 01:46:49,767
Why are we doing this again?

1207
01:46:49,802 --> 01:46:51,230
Why are we doing this again?

1208
01:46:54,037 --> 01:46:57,434
The biochemist and the
engineer tried to kill me tonight.

1209
01:46:57,469 --> 01:47:00,404
This merry-go-round ends now!

1210
01:47:02,848 --> 01:47:05,376
If things
aren't drastically different,

1211
01:47:05,411 --> 01:47:07,246
we'll be chasing our
own shadows.

1212
01:47:09,987 --> 01:47:11,415
But a few things have changed.

1213
01:47:13,221 --> 01:47:14,792
The soldier's out of bullets.

1214
01:47:15,993 --> 01:47:17,256
We heard a gunshot.

1215
01:47:18,127 --> 01:47:19,874
He was
never supposed to have a gun

1216
01:47:19,898 --> 01:47:23,735
in this experiment, so he won't
have ammunition next time.

1217
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:24,901
You heard a gunshot?

1218
01:47:26,971 --> 01:47:29,400
I have no choice but
to frame the soldier

1219
01:47:29,435 --> 01:47:32,711
so that the others
will still suspect him.

1220
01:47:34,011 --> 01:47:37,507
They'll drive him away so
he can be in the right place

1221
01:47:37,542 --> 01:47:40,884
at the right time to come
back and save me again.

1222
01:47:41,887 --> 01:47:43,282
I need a fail safe.

1223
01:47:46,287 --> 01:47:48,221
But I'll do my best to remember.

1224
01:47:53,195 --> 01:47:54,766
Don't worry, Dad.

1225
01:47:57,397 --> 01:47:59,298
I'll fix it this time.

1226
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:14,049
Don't worry,
Dad, I'll fix it this time.

1227
01:48:15,151 --> 01:48:20,187
- Don't worry, Dad, I'll fix it this time.
- Stop, stop!

1228
01:48:40,110 --> 01:48:41,110
I'm sorry.

1229
01:48:44,345 --> 01:48:46,378
I'm so sorry, but I'd.

1230
01:48:49,053 --> 01:48:53,022
I'd rather live through it
again than live with it.

1231
01:48:59,195 --> 01:49:03,560
Weep not. He's not dead,

1232
01:49:03,595 --> 01:49:05,298
but sleepeth.

1233
01:49:53,381 --> 01:49:55,447
It will be as though you've
passed through

1234
01:49:55,482 --> 01:49:57,218
a veil of forgetfulness.

1235
01:49:58,419 --> 01:50:01,123
Remember, you must remember.

1236
01:50:03,193 --> 01:50:04,489
I don't want to.

1237
01:50:05,725 --> 01:50:10,528
And the Lord God caused a
deep sleep to fall upon them.

1238
01:51:21,502 --> 01:51:22,502
(scraping metal
