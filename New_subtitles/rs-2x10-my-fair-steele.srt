Eric's our chauffeur.

652
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,817
Then showing up last night
was just an act...

653
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:33,183
to see if he could put Roxie
out of commission too.

654
00:44:33,288 --> 00:44:35,813
- So Eric kidnapped Tracy.
- That's right.

655
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:39,621
And if you remember, after Roxie arrived
at the party, he left immediately.

656
00:44:39,728 --> 00:44:42,993
To see ifTracy had gotten loose.
He must be working for somebody.

657
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:45,498
We better make our move.
He may be after Roxie right now.

Tracy, I know that you hold
the present management responsible...

660
00:44:57,212 --> 00:44:59,442
for the company's recent losses.

who hired you to abduct Tracy?

But there are values

you do so at your own risk.

You're the one tryin' to kill me!
Don't I have some value?

So, you're Tracy, huh?

- Mmm.

been the heiress and Tracy the waitress.

Are you insinuating that there are those close
to you who haven't been as fortunate...

or haven't had
the same abilities?

Laura, there are bits and pieces in my past
that are as obscure to me as they are to you.

And it's at moments like this
that I realize they're less painful that way.
