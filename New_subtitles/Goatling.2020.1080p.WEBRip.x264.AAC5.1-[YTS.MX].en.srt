1
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:52,525
Have you, by any
chance, realized

2
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:55,295
the useless piece of
shit that you've raised?

3
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:05,931
You keep talking,
fucking porkies.

4
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:23,817
Off!

5
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:53,981
Hey, off, off!

6
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,548
Off!

7
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:05,886
Can you see this?

8
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:09,221
And let's see if you can
teach your little brothers,

9
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,689
you piece of shit!

10
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:53,959
How is this?

11
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,863
Make sure this grub
is ready soon, no?

12
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:58,397
Keep quiet!

13
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,865
Oh.

14
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,698
Father doesn't like you.

15
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:39,740
You stink!

16
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:56,023
You're not even our brother.

17
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,336
And lead us not into temptation.

18
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,378
I believe in God,
the Father Almighty,

19
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,814
creator of heaven and earth,

20
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:58,817
Jesus Christ his
only son, Our Lord,

21
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,919
conceived by the power
of the Holy Spirit

22
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,788
and born of the Virgin Mary.

23
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,890
I believe in God,
the Father Almighty,

24
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,391
creator of heaven and earth.

25
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,361
I believe in Jesus Christ
his only son, Our Lord,

26
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:11,598
born of the Virgin Mary.

27
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,465
I believe in God,
the Father Almighty,

28
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,000
creator of heaven and earth.

29
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:17,537
I believe in Jesus
Christ his only son,

30
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:20,239
who was born of the Virgin Mary.

31
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:21,708
I believe in God,
the Father Almighty,

32
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,908
creator of heaven and earth.

33
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,343
The kids are playing outside.

34
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:26,411
Jesus Christ his only son,

35
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,180
who was born of the Virgin Mary.

36
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,716
I believe in God, the Father.

37
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:32,050
Almighty,
creator of heaven and earth.

38
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,418
I believe in Jesus Christ.

39
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,588
His only son, Our Lord.

40
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,526
He was conceived by the
power of the Holy Spirit

41
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:43,128
and born of the Virgin Mary.

42
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,165
He suffered under
Pontius Pilate.

43
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,337
He was crucified,
died, and was buried.

44
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,146
Get out!

45
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:04,218
Get out!

46
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:14,860
Give us our daily bread.

47
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,436
Lead us not into temptation.

48
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,216
You sick...

49
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:39,987
You sick bastard.

50
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,797
Hey, you sick!

51
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,304
You sick!

52
00:14:37,512 --> 00:14:39,581
Satan runs our city.

53
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,584
He destroys our crops.

54
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:47,119
He enters our home, our family,

55
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:50,290
through promiscuity and hatred.

56
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,327
Together, we are stronger.

57
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:57,197
Only together we
will attain glory.

58
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,266
His salvation.

59
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:05,538
Jesus takes care for his
flock as he goes walking,

60
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,476
walking together, with the
principles of the Mother Church.

61
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:15,480
We cannot surrender
ourselves, we cannot give up

62
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,916
that fellowship in Christ.

63
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,520
And, now, brothers and sisters,

64
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:22,421
return with the
peace and the grace

65
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:24,291
of the Lord to your homes.

66
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:28,895
Grace to the Lord, amen.

67
00:15:28,897 --> 00:15:30,431
Amen.

68
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,900
Is he dead?

69
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:43,368
I told you
not to hit him so hard.

70
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:06,293
Leave the little
sinner, Mommy boy's alone.

71
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,395
Where's our money?

72
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,873
Bastard.

73
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,510
Go on, get out.

74
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:24,710
Go!

75
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,424
Boo.

76
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:47,399
Little boy, today,
you will learn

77
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:51,005
what every father has to
teach his son to survive.

78
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:55,777
How to bring real food
home to us at the house.

79
00:17:58,913 --> 00:17:59,913
What?

80
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,150
Your mother never told you
that the food you're eating,

81
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:09,557
that was, you are
eating the meat

82
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:11,558
that you were...

83
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:20,034
You see all this
stuff here, boy?

84
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:23,705
This is very expensive for me.

85
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,976
This costs me my sweat,

86
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,678
and I'm not going to be
able to feed you or your ma

87
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,348
or anyone with this here.

88
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:44,559
Today's lesson,

89
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:50,062
how to become a big man.

90
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,108
Or die

91
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,346
for Brazil.

92
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,891
Listen to me, boy.

93
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,899
I don't know if you know it,

94
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:03,738
but it's not easy to get
all this food, you know.

95
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:12,780
I want you to pay
close attention

96
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,380
this here.

97
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,157
Someone has to eat.

98
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,794
Someone has to do it, my son.

99
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,468
And there's not a poor,
little thing like you

100
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:39,272
that would let me
be less than I am.

101
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:41,741
Shut up!

102
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,321
You see this fucking
cursed worm, hmm?

103
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:34,595
Can you believe he was
robbing food in the fields?

104
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:37,832
What does he deserve, huh?

105
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,903
He deserves to be minced,

106
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:44,603
just like the military are doing

107
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:46,439
with the hippies
in the big city.

108
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,647
Do you want to talk?

109
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:01,221
Don't scream.

110
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:03,624
You're not going
to scream, right?

111
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:11,130
Promise!

112
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,736
Shh!

113
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:28,549
Do you see this
little thing here?

114
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:31,784
This little thing
here has already taken

115
00:22:31,786 --> 00:22:33,254
a lot of people to hell.

116
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:38,591
She brings and takes,

117
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:42,763
brings and takes.

118
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:56,842
You're going to learn
how to kill a pig.

119
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:59,013
Shh.

120
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:10,324
And I've got a surprise for you.

121
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,659
Chan-chan-chan-cha!

122
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:20,266
Get me out of here!

123
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:30,643
Look in his eyes.

124
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:31,645
Look.

125
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:38,219
You recognize this
little worm now?

126
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:42,223
Are you seeing who this is?

127
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:36,711
I baptize you in the
name of the Father.

128
00:24:45,453 --> 00:24:47,886
I believe in God,
the Father Almighty,

129
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:49,722
creator of heaven and earth.

130
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:53,325
I believe in Jesus Christ
his only son, Our Lord.

131
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:57,763
He was conceived by the
power of the Holy Spirit

132
00:24:57,765 --> 00:24:59,598
and born of the Virgin Mary.

133
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Creator of heaven.

134
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:19,887
Go on, go to your mother.

135
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:24,625
Now your goatling is baptized.

136
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,292
You monster!

137
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:28,293
You monster!

138
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:29,828
Why did you do this?

139
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,631
I told you, you will pay!

140
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:35,434
I told you, you monster!

141
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:38,637
Monster, monster!

142
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:43,644
I hate you, I hate you!

143
00:26:09,804 --> 00:26:13,772
Forgiveness from Jesus,
forgiveness from Jesus.

144
00:26:13,774 --> 00:26:16,942
Jesus was crowned with thorns.

145
00:26:16,944 --> 00:26:20,646
He cast out his
words, his thoughts,

146
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:25,653
his judgments, condemnations,
impurities, betrayals.

147
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:30,022
Forgiveness from Jesus,
forgiveness from Jesus,

148
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:33,759
who was crowned with thorns
because of his thoughts,

149
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:37,096
not his words and impurities.

150
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:39,433
Forgiveness from Jesus.

151
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:45,632
Jesus Christ his only son.

152
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:55,440
Jesus Christ his only son.

153
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:28,541
I'm done.

154
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:30,878
God knows that what
I'm doing is not a sin.

155
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:35,914
Oh my God.

156
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:36,916
I don't want to!

157
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:47,226
Both!

158
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:48,427
Come here.

159
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:49,662
What are you gonna do, freak?

160
00:28:49,664 --> 00:28:52,665
Sit down, both of
you, come on, sit!

161
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:54,900
The Lord knows everything, shh!

162
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:57,102
He will guide us.

163
00:28:57,104 --> 00:28:59,006
You will thank me later.

164
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,140
It has to be today.

165
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:04,009
There's no time.

166
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:05,777
What do you
want to do with them.

167
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:09,716
Take them
far away, please, Father.

168
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:13,118
I need them far away from
that house, that man.

169
00:29:56,698 --> 00:29:58,063
Sit down.

170
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:04,739
You dirty the name of the Lord.

171
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,710
Stab your hands with
blood of sinners.

172
00:30:09,678 --> 00:30:11,713
The devil has touched you.

173
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:20,722
You betrayed God.

174
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:25,357
You're evil, you
betrayed the Lord,

175
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,430
the Father Almighty
who hates liars.

176
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:35,135
There's only one way
for you to apologize.

177
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,841
You will kill Satan
with the hands

178
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:44,546
that killed the sinners.

179
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:51,118
You will put out defective
meat to feed to the pigs.

180
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,089
Only then, your soul
will perish in paradise.

181
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:57,923
No.

182
00:30:57,925 --> 00:30:59,625
Here stay here.

183
00:30:59,627 --> 00:31:02,630
You will do everything I say.

184
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:26,051
Hey, ha, ha!

185
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,422
Get outta here!

186
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,098
I can see you!

187
00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:53,412
Get out!

188
00:32:15,537 --> 00:32:16,537
What?

189
00:32:18,972 --> 00:32:21,108
What's this, huh?

190
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:25,944
Fuck!

191
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,693
Where is that piece of shit?

192
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:16,529
And the hide of the goat.

193
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:17,531
I'll wear it.

194
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:25,005
And this wanker
God that you love.

195
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:48,928
Come here.
- I bought you one?

196
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,598
Come here to your captain.

197
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:54,967
Thank the
Lord for the food, first.

198
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:55,969
Look,

199
00:33:57,605 --> 00:34:01,974
the only Lord here
in this house is me.

200
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:40,949
You dropped me.

201
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:30,958
Did you bring something to eat?

202
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:36,196
You are really
worthless, aren't ya?

203
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:40,068
You're not even capable of
bringing food to the house.

204
00:36:45,606 --> 00:36:47,474
I tried to help you, my son.

205
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:51,713
As God as my witness, I
tried to help you, son!

206
00:36:54,048 --> 00:36:57,350
I sacrificed myself
and for what?

207
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:00,955
For you, it's not
important, right?

208
00:37:05,026 --> 00:37:08,060
My dear God, it looks
as though the devil

209
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:09,664
is trying to mess up my life!

210
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:28,048
Blessings.

211
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:42,995
Are you really going
to let your old mother

212
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:44,295
do this job for you?

213
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:45,800
Are you that useless?

214
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:49,637
I can't stand eating this meat.

215
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:55,942
Drop that!

216
00:37:58,012 --> 00:37:59,747
There's no food for you.

217
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:01,814
Leave it!

218
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:42,523
The Lord is watching you
disrespect the Gospels, my son.

219
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,025
Honor your father and mother.

220
00:38:46,027 --> 00:38:47,762
Will you remember that?

221
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:54,700
Do you know where God in
the Gospels say bad boys go?

222
00:38:54,702 --> 00:38:56,637
The filthy sinner boys.

223
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:59,574
You don't know, don't ya?

224
00:39:00,508 --> 00:39:01,676
You're useless.

225
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:46,654
How many?

226
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:50,756
How many what, huh?

227
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:53,194
How many laid in
this dirty bed, woman?

228
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,494
None of your business.

229
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:57,496
How many?

230
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:01,533
What the fuck, huh?

231
00:40:01,535 --> 00:40:03,971
20, 30?

232
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:05,972
50?

233
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:08,376
You bastard!

234
00:40:11,212 --> 00:40:13,080
What the fuck is this?

235
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:17,784
Where are you going?

236
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,320
Huh?

237
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:27,261
You're going to fuck
your own mother, right?

238
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:48,282
Tonight is a special night, son.

239
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:51,953
Dinner is reinforced.

240
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:58,357
It's the moment to
gather strength, my boy.

241
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:02,828
Here, we need to stay
together and be strong

242
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,531
to listen to what the
Lord is telling us.

243
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:06,365
Ma.

244
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:08,100
Don't interrupt me.

245
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:09,102
Listen to me.

246
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,644
You think I don't know
about your little calf?

247
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:23,749
Do you think I don't know
about the Mary Magdalene

248
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:25,451
you have seen in the dark?

249
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:27,154
- Listen, Mom-
- Shut your mouth!

250
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,190
Respect me!

251
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:34,462
You're going to
bring me that calf.

252
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,200
And now be quiet, and you
follow me on my prayers.

253
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:49,775
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

254
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:52,878
Blessed art thou amongst women

255
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,016
and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb Jesus.

256
00:41:57,018 --> 00:42:00,688
Holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners

257
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:04,423
now and at the
hour of our death.

258
00:42:04,425 --> 00:42:05,425
Amen.

259
00:42:25,312 --> 00:42:26,578
You're dead.

260
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:11,345
There's something
bad behind me, woman.

261
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:12,845
What?

262
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:15,182
I'm seeing...

263
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:20,253
It's...

264
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,157
I don't know what I'm seeing.

265
00:45:27,928 --> 00:45:28,928
What?

266
00:45:37,572 --> 00:45:39,104
Don't laugh.

267
00:45:41,676 --> 00:45:43,275
Shut up.

268
00:45:43,277 --> 00:45:47,045
That's all
I need right now, hmm?

269
00:45:47,047 --> 00:45:48,880
You don't understand.

270
00:45:48,882 --> 00:45:49,716
Huh?

271
00:45:49,718 --> 00:45:50,985
You don't understand.

272
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:55,153
It's behind me.
- This little boy crap.

273
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:58,492
Come here.

274
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:53,312
Hey, what is this?

275
00:46:56,016 --> 00:46:57,684
What the hell is this?

276
00:46:57,686 --> 00:46:59,521
- It's here.
- Look up.

277
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:02,988
- It's here.
- What is here?

278
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,823
It's cold.

279
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:07,560
Wake up, wake up, stop it!

280
00:47:07,562 --> 00:47:09,664
Stop, stop, stop it, hey!

281
00:47:11,298 --> 00:47:13,668
What is it, what is it?

282
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:16,870
What is it, huh?

283
00:47:19,473 --> 00:47:22,407
Get what out, get what out?

284
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:24,142
What are you talking about?

285
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:28,781
Stop it, stop, stop, please.

286
00:47:29,784 --> 00:47:31,185
Stop it, stop it.

287
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:35,557
What is it, hey, hey.

288
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:38,458
Calm down.

289
00:47:40,662 --> 00:47:42,764
What was it, huh?

290
00:47:44,098 --> 00:47:45,098
Calm down.

291
00:48:39,888 --> 00:48:42,154
Yeah.

292
00:48:42,156 --> 00:48:44,256
We have to think about
that baby in there.

293
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:45,490
Can you see how big it is?

294
00:48:45,492 --> 00:48:47,926
Look here, look at this.

295
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:50,295
I've already bought

296
00:48:50,297 --> 00:48:51,798
this for you.
- Oh, really?

297
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,699
Can use that one.

298
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:55,701
And look very nice.

299
00:49:01,442 --> 00:49:02,374
I know.

300
00:49:02,376 --> 00:49:03,975
It's because when he's born,

301
00:49:03,977 --> 00:49:07,880
everything has to be
tidy and neat, right?

302
00:49:07,882 --> 00:49:09,181
- It will be.
- If it would be

303
00:49:09,183 --> 00:49:12,119
up to that useless
brother of yours.

304
00:49:14,823 --> 00:49:17,723
I don't know how he
got you pregnant.

305
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:47,019
Don't talk!

306
00:49:48,623 --> 00:49:49,889
Shut your mouth!

307
00:49:56,965 --> 00:49:59,534
Sweetheart, darling,

308
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:02,704
have you had dinner yet?

309
00:50:04,104 --> 00:50:06,806
Let's eat, no, no, no,
no, no, we pray first!

310
00:50:06,808 --> 00:50:08,440
We pray now!

311
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:16,316
You want some food, my love?

312
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:19,451
You're gonna want some food.

313
00:50:19,453 --> 00:50:20,588
I'll feed you.

314
00:50:21,556 --> 00:50:23,221
You don't want some food?

315
00:50:23,223 --> 00:50:25,357
It smells delicious.

316
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:26,359
Let me see here.

317
00:50:47,314 --> 00:50:52,152
Mother, aren't you happy
about your food, Mom?

318
00:50:55,823 --> 00:50:57,357
My loving, darling mom.

319
00:51:00,995 --> 00:51:03,297
I'll bring you some
food every day, Mama.

320
00:51:04,532 --> 00:51:06,364
Every day.

321
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:15,509
Shut your mouth!

322
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:19,647
I'm speaking now!

323
00:51:22,617 --> 00:51:23,916
I'm gonna talk now!

324
00:51:29,691 --> 00:51:30,691
We pray now.

325
00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:35,529
We pray now.

326
00:51:37,065 --> 00:51:39,431
No one eats before praying.

327
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:45,739
Mother.

328
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:48,774
Mom.

329
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:54,889
Days of rot.

330
00:55:58,826 --> 00:56:00,127
Hard times.

331
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:07,400
You have no idea, my dear,

332
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:13,440
how hard it is to
get food every day.

333
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:16,075
Real food, good food.

334
00:56:16,077 --> 00:56:19,914
Not that shitty crap they
insist on having us swallow!

335
00:56:25,086 --> 00:56:27,255
What world is this?

336
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:33,025
What world is this?

337
00:56:33,027 --> 00:56:36,764
My dear, you don't wanna know.

338
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:42,736
Dog world.

339
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:45,472
You do very well by
being quiet here!

340
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:59,587
When did humanity
begin hiding true love?

341
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:03,856
Sincere love, my darling.

342
00:57:10,064 --> 00:57:11,198
But we didn't.

343
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:19,740
Not us, right, sweetheart?

344
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:29,782
Or the name of the God
had been drugged too.

345
00:57:29,784 --> 00:57:34,219
All these people,
those who no longer

346
00:57:34,221 --> 00:57:35,890
believe in true love anymore.

347
00:57:41,162 --> 00:57:42,296
Not us, my dear.

348
00:58:19,066 --> 00:58:21,435
What lovely days.

349
00:58:28,843 --> 00:58:30,945
What lovely days.

350
00:58:51,399 --> 00:58:52,400
Let us know.

351
00:59:50,124 --> 00:59:53,892
♪ Is
from my sweet ♪

352
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:58,263
♪ She had hard eyes ♪

353
00:59:58,265 --> 00:59:59,265
♪ That look ♪

354
01:00:01,702 --> 01:00:05,272
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

355
01:00:08,476 --> 01:00:09,810
I was never good at this.

356
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:14,882
Calm down, calm down.

357
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:21,956
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai.

358
01:00:23,525 --> 01:00:28,227
My mother, she's been talking
crap to you again, right?

359
01:00:28,229 --> 01:00:29,229
Mom!

360
01:00:31,098 --> 01:00:33,501
She's not like the
other ones, no ma'am!

361
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:41,275
She's my real favorite, my girl!

362
01:00:42,476 --> 01:00:46,378
You son of a bitch,
I hate you, I hate you!

363
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,180
I hate you, let me go!

364
01:00:48,182 --> 01:00:50,349
Let me go!

365
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:53,752
Release me, release me!

366
01:00:53,754 --> 01:00:56,388
Calm, calm, calm.

367
01:00:58,325 --> 01:01:00,325
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop!

368
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:01,327
I'm sorry.

369
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:06,599
I hate you, I hate you so much!

370
01:01:06,601 --> 01:01:07,601
Release me!

371
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:12,840
My little girl,
my pretty flower.

372
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:15,943
You're beautiful.

373
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:19,813
I will never feel cold again.

374
01:01:21,015 --> 01:01:24,551
Let me go.

375
01:01:24,553 --> 01:01:25,719
Never again.

376
01:01:27,488 --> 01:01:28,954
You're disgusting.

377
01:01:28,956 --> 01:01:31,089
- Pretty flower.
- Stop!

378
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:36,896
Release me.

379
01:01:37,865 --> 01:01:39,364
Let me go.

380
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:41,168
Let me go.

381
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:47,472
I'm still very cold, you bitch.

382
01:01:47,474 --> 01:01:49,642
Stop it.

383
01:01:49,644 --> 01:01:52,144
I am cold deep inside.

384
01:01:52,146 --> 01:01:53,078
Stop it.

385
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,213
- Stop it.
- It is my soul,

386
01:01:54,215 --> 01:01:56,281
you terrible bitch.
- Stop it.

387
01:01:57,552 --> 01:02:00,955
You're just like all of them.

388
01:02:18,573 --> 01:02:20,474
Warm me up, my darling.

389
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:27,815
Warm me up, my compassion.

390
01:02:29,049 --> 01:02:30,049
Please.

391
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:32,952
Please.

392
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:37,490
Stop it.

393
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:43,864
♪ The goddess from my sweet ♪

394
01:02:49,203 --> 01:02:51,303
Please, stop it.

395
01:03:00,749 --> 01:03:01,815
Please, stop.

396
01:03:12,026 --> 01:03:15,262
- Rosalita.
- Please.

397
01:05:50,585 --> 01:05:53,418
Release the flesh dear God.

398
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:35,797
Blessings.

399
01:07:29,149 --> 01:07:32,386
Hi, useless.

400
01:07:36,356 --> 01:07:37,356
Hi.

401
01:07:43,063 --> 01:07:46,464
You are useless.

402
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:53,204
There is a black coffin passing

403
01:07:53,206 --> 01:07:56,243
through the middle of the crowd.

404
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:00,813
I see people crying

405
01:08:00,815 --> 01:08:04,817
for the one inside the coffin.

406
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:09,254
They arrive at the cemetery

407
01:08:09,256 --> 01:08:13,427
and put the black
coffin on the marble.

408
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,009
You bastard.

409
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:07,902
You took her from
me, my Rosalita.

410
01:11:09,302 --> 01:11:11,670
You took her from me.

411
01:11:11,672 --> 01:11:15,109
The only thing I truly
loved in this world!

412
01:11:16,978 --> 01:11:18,212
I hate you!

413
01:11:20,681 --> 01:11:22,183
I hate you, Mommy!

414
01:11:24,919 --> 01:11:26,419
I hate you, Mommy!

415
01:11:30,357 --> 01:11:34,061
You didn't take care
of me, Mommy.

416
01:11:38,533 --> 01:11:40,601
I'm getting cold, Mommy.

417
01:12:17,672 --> 01:12:22,308
Today, I just want
to know if the Lord

418
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:27,315
is seeing all of
this, and, if he is,

419
01:12:28,716 --> 01:12:33,120
I hope he knows he's a
great motherfucking liar.

420
01:12:33,144 --> 01:12:35,144
