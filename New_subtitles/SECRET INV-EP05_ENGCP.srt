1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,875
He's building a machine.

2
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:09,333
What kind of machine?

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,417
<i>I think
it's to make us stronger.</i>

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:12,833
Now, at the council meeting,

5
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:15,500
I told you I had a plan
for taking Earth as our own.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,667
The heroes of Earth will react.

7
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,625
The only way we can counter that
is to become super ourselves.

8
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:23,167
Super Skrulls.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,833
Who's leading the science?

10
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:27,833
Dalton. The name's Dalton.

11
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:34,292
<i>One of the two occupants
of that lovely country manor of yours</i>

12
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,083
<i>is catching a bullet today.</i>

13
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:37,667
You can flip a coin for all I care.

14
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,042
They'll be coming for you.

15
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:45,875
I'm dealing with my own infiltration
at the moment.

16
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:52,375
There are Skrulls
inside the U.S. government.

17
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,708
We need to start
pounding blood transfusions.

18
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:15,958
There's a cooler in the OR.

19
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,708
Mr. President, can you hear me?

20
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:19,083
Sir, you need to make a space.

21
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:21,417
- This was not the Russians. It was not.
- Sir.

22
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,125
I'll crack his chest,
you take the laparotomy.

23
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,309
You think he can tolerate it?

24
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,875
Whatever you do,
do not trust Colonel Rhodes.

25
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,167
- His pulse is dropping.
- Let's go.

26
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,750
Sir, do you have clearance?

27
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,500
Then stay outside.

28
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:34,934
<i>In a bizarre twist,</i>

29
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,000
<i>President Ritson was rescued
from the assault</i>

30
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:40,875
<i>by what eyewitnesses describe
as a shapeshifting alien.</i>

31
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:43,875
<i>As we stand by for news
regarding the status...</i>

32
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,708
Assemble the operatives.

33
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,792
You should be proud, G.

34
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,917
- Talos is finally...
- What? Dead?

35
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,125
Our target was the President,
and he's still alive.

36
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,208
- We don't know that yet.
- No.

37
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:07,667
But what we know
is our war is yet to be set in motion.

38
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,625
And if you'd have stolen
what you were supposed to,

39
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,083
I could've taken out the convoy
single-handed.

40
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,167
But would you?

41
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:19,292
You ordered Fury's death
when you knew Varra would never do it.

42
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:23,792
You had another chance to kill Fury today,
and you didn't take it.

43
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,292
Because he has what we need.

44
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,417
Explain it to us.

45
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,500
You told me Fury hid the Avengers' DNA,

46
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,417
but it wasn't in any of the locations
you provided.

47
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,750
No, Fury never trusted you,

48
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,875
and it makes me start to wonder
why should we...

49
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,625
Pagon thought he had a voice,

50
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:54,333
but none of you do.

51
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,042
You're faceless

52
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:58,542
and you're nameless.

53
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,708
And the only reason
Fury was on that motorway

54
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:05,583
was because his traitor wife
defied my direct order.

55
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:08,042
Do you understand?

56
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,625
Well, then you send some of our people
to Varra's house and kill her.

57
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:41,333
<i>Yeah?</i>

58
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:42,875
Where are you?

59
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,542
On my way to the hospital,
to make our outcome favorable.

60
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,167
Change of plans.

61
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,292
<i>Keep Ritson alive.</i>

62
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,792
<i>Make sure he knows
it wasn't just the Russians who did this.</i>

63
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:55,875
<i>It was the Russians
with the help of Skrulls.</i>

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,542
What?

65
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,333
Show him satellite footage
of New Skrullos.

66
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:03,542
<i>Prove to him there are Skrulls
living here in Russia,</i>

67
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:06,417
and that they must all be eliminated.

68
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:11,333
- Gravik, have you lost your damn mind?
<i>- No. This is leverage, Raava.</i>

69
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:16,167
Fury doesn't wanna see World War III,
or to see innocent Skrulls die.

70
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,458
<i>Let me handle him.</i>

71
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,125
And if we don't get what we want?

72
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,833
Well, then we all do
what we've prepared for.

73
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,792
Sacrifice.

74
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,917
Where's the President?

75
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,875
Damn people,
giving out classified information.

76
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,583
Lock this whole place down right now.

77
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:38,917
Unbelievable.

78
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:44,208
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay, okay. Calm down. Calm down.

79
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:45,708
Do something! I dare you.

80
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:47,542
Stand down. Stand down.

81
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,875
Fury's just very excited to see me.

82
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,000
Listen...

83
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,375
The country appreciates your service
to the President tonight,

84
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,458
but I'm here now. You can go.

85
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:01,375
You must be outta your Skrull-ass mind,

86
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,542
you think I'm gonna let you
get anywhere near the President.

87
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,792
Well, in order to out me, Nick,
you're gonna have to kill me.

88
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:12,625
And you don't wanna kill me
because you're not ready to die.

89
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:18,292
But being as I'm not one
to pull a gun and not use it,

90
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,875
let me give you a little heads-up.

91
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,417
In about sixty seconds,

92
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,125
the footage of you killing Maria Hill

93
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:30,250
is gonna lead off every news program
all across the hemisphere.

94
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,458
That's right.

95
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:38,042
And you're gonna become the most wanted
and hated man on the planet.

96
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,708
- You didn't.
- Oh, yeah, I did.

97
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,917
I really, really did.

98
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,792
So tick tock, Nick.

99
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,125
Consider this a preview, Nick,

100
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:03,750
because if you ever get within
100 yards of the President again,

101
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,333
I'm gonna make sure
you get the whole show.

102
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,458
Mmm.

103
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,375
Tell Gravik I'm coming for him.

104
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,375
Tell him yourself.

105
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:24,708
{\an8}<i>This just in.</i>

106
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,625
<i>Former S.H.I.E.L.D. Director,
Nicholas Fury,</i>

107
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:30,042
<i>is being sought for the murder
of former S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Maria Hill</i>

108
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,208
<i>as officials investigate
Fury's possible involvement</i>

109
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:36,042
<i>in the failed attempt
on President Ritson's life.</i>

110
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,333
<i>Sonya Falsworth
here to see you, sir.</i>

111
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:39,792
Tell her I'm busy.

112
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,708
Don't mind me.
I didn't see anything. Promise.

113
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,250
Good afternoon, Sonya.
Have you heard about this?

114
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,542
The attack on Ritson? No. Do go on.

115
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,458
Well, do you really believe
that Skrulls could be amongst us?

116
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:55,708
Well, if you ask me, sir,
I think they're bloody everywhere.

117
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,625
Sonya...

118
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:00,458
What are you doing?

119
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:03,083
Politely asking the location
of Dr. Rosa Dalton.

120
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,750
Have you lost your mind, woman?

121
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,875
Argh!

122
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,458
Ms. Falsworth.

123
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:11,542
What have you done?

124
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,292
Just showing
Director Weatherby's true colors.

125
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,667
Come on, look at that.

126
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:21,208
I must inform you that the SIS
has no official policy on killing Skrulls.

127
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,917
So unless you want me to enact
my personal preference right now,

128
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,417
you should start talking.

129
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,833
<i>Yo, Gravik.
You got a minute?</i>

130
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,375
What's on your mind, soldier?

131
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,583
Was just a little confused.

132
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:41,917
What are you confused about?

133
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,250
Well, Pagon.

134
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,375
Well, he failed us.

135
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:51,667
Oh.

136
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,375
You scared?

137
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,208
Yeah, maybe a little.

138
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,917
Speak.

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,333
<i>He's out of surgery.</i>

140
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,042
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

141
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,708
<i>Once he's awake,
I'll send confirmation of the strike.</i>

142
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:17,792
Yeah.

143
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:21,333
Because you know what happens
if you don't, right?

144
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,167
Who wants it?

145
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,125
Huh?

146
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,750
Who else?

147
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,958
You're nothing but a monster.

148
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:41,375
I remember playing beneath this
when I was a kid.

149
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,750
My father told me what it meant,

150
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,250
but I've forgotten.

151
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:55,250
During World War II,
Nazis practically destroyed this area.

152
00:13:56,542 --> 00:14:01,083
Afterward, Brixton became a haven
for immigrants from the West Indies.

153
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,875
This was all they had.

154
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,542
Is that why you chose this place?

155
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:09,333
The path of struggle is steep.

156
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,875
I feel a lot of strength
when I'm over here.

157
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,917
Talos did too.

158
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,958
- Talos died...
- You can stop there.

159
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:29,083
He died.

160
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,542
On a foreign planet.

161
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,500
On a foreign road.

162
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,292
Nothing will come of it.

163
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:44,750
I ran away from my father
because I knew he would lose.

164
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:51,042
Talos chose the path of struggle,
he did not lose.

165
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:57,750
You cannot let grief paralyze you, G'iah.
This is your time. Now!

166
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:06,000
Talos told me
how you survived your execution.

167
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,000
I had no other choice.

168
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:13,917
What DNA did Gravik steal?

169
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,583
Only a few samples.

170
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,750
Cull Obsidian, Flora Colossus.

171
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,750
But he took those because
he couldn't find what he was looking for.

172
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,417
What was he looking for?

173
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:28,583
Something he called "the Harvest."

174
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,583
The Harvest.

175
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:37,125
I need to bury my father.

176
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,375
Take him to Priscilla.
She'll know what to do.

177
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,125
Oh, shit.

178
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,375
I'll be in touch.

179
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,833
- Where are you going?
- Finland.

180
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,667
You gonna be all right, kid?

181
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,917
Don't worry about me.

182
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,500
I'll put on a good face.

183
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,375
Oh.

184
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,917
Hello, Skrulls.

185
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,458
Who are you?

186
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,208
I think a more apt question would be,

187
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,875
who would you like me to be?

188
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,500
I'm staggeringly versatile.

189
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,625
To give you a couple of examples,
I'm very good at being your bestie.

190
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,250
I'm also devilishly good
at being not your bestie.

191
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,833
It's really just a matter of taste.
Cake or death.

192
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,958
- Get out.
- Now, this is quite the clerical error.

193
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,833
Nigel, we're going to have to have
someone in admin either fired,

194
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:56,333
or, you know, shot, because this
is becoming a bit of a health hazard.

195
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:57,958
- No, my name's Victor.
- Of course.

196
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:01,958
Nigel's the one with his silencer
pressed against the base of your skull.

197
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,208
Ooh. There he is.
Would you like to take a seat?

198
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,708
Now, from these samples I was able
to observe under the microscope,

199
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,875
you are breaking
quite transgressive ground.

200
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:14,833
Would you like to tell me?

201
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:18,292
- No, our work here is far too...
- No, not you. Dr. Dalton, you.

202
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,125
My work is very involved.

203
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,875
It spans several different areas of focus.

204
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,667
Ah, well, let's focus on this, shall we?

205
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,125
Now, start from the very beginning,
and don't miss out a damn decimal point.

206
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,500
Well Rosa,
this really is a lovely laboratory.

207
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,667
Unfortunately, I'm going to
have to torch it. You win some, lose some.

208
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:59,125
We'll never betray Gravik.
Let us go or I'll kill her.

209
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,458
Oh, I don't doubt you for a moment.

210
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,875
The males in my species are very similar.

211
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,125
If they're not busy gaslighting you,
they're threatening you with murder.

212
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,042
That's what all the podcasts are about.

213
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,500
Professor Davis?

214
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:43,000
You're the one he sent to kill me?

215
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:45,125
I'm G'iah.

216
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,125
Fury said you could help me
bury my father.

217
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,750
How you feeling, Mr. President?

218
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,667
Helpless.

219
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,875
Would you like to change that, sir?

220
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:11,833
As you no doubt saw with your own eyes,
these Skrulls aided in that attack.

221
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:13,208
Yeah, I saw.

222
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:17,750
But the Skrulls are most definitely here.
And they're working with the Russians.

223
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,633
Now, of course,
the Russians are denying this,

224
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:23,917
but we've received corroborating evidence
from Sonya Falsworth at SIS.

225
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,375
My God.

226
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:32,583
Now, Mr. President, what you see
on this screen is the Skrull compound.

227
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:34,417
That's Russian soil.

228
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,792
We have to neutralize this facility.

229
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,000
England is 100% behind us,

230
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,917
as soon as the rest of NATO
sees this proof,

231
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,750
they're gonna be on board too. Believe me.

232
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,708
A strike on Russian soil?

233
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,750
That means World War III.

234
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:52,625
I would rather us face a war
than extinction.

235
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,583
And that's exactly
what a Skrull invasion will mean.

236
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,792
We have to cut this thing off at the head.

237
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,667
And now.

238
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,667
I was wondering when you were gonna call.

239
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:11,458
You'd like to think
you're a step ahead of me, Fury.

240
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:16,000
Ah. You're a jet, and I need rocket fuel
to stay ahead of you.

241
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,458
I got a deal for you.

242
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,958
Got anything to do with the Harvest?

243
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:25,250
Bring it to me in person,
I'll call the whole thing off.

244
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:28,208
Call what thing off?

245
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,292
<i>I thought you were
a step ahead of me.</i>

246
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,000
<i>I'm raising the stakes, Fury.</i>

247
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,333
If I don't get what I want,
your President's gonna bomb New Skrullos.

248
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:37,500
Then the war is on.

249
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,583
And bring some iodide pills.

250
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:42,417
The reactor room
can be a touch aggressive.

251
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:04,958
An Interpol Red Notice. Wow.

252
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:07,250
They don't just give those out to anyone.
Kudos.

253
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:10,042
Yeah, well, Mama always said
I was special.

254
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,375
Yeah, Mama was right.

255
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,542
Feel a lot better
if we were on the Helicarrier.

256
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,583
Yeah, that's been mothballed.

257
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,625
A little bit like you should be.

258
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Oh!

259
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,458
Before I forget, <i>voilà.</i>

260
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,917
Figured you might need that
on the other side.

261
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,083
You're welcome.

262
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,625
Oh, and try and get a nap.
You seem a little grumpy.

263
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,417
He was our general.

264
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,583
He deserves a procession of mourners.

265
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:54,375
Talos wasn't much for pageantry.

266
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,042
Do you have the offering?

267
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,292
It was my mother's.

268
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,542
I don't know the prayer.

269
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,708
It's okay. I know it.

270
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:03,250
I told him he was a failure.

271
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:07,250
What kind of daughter
says that to her father?

272
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:12,542
The kind that intends to make it up to him
the next time she sees him.

273
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:18,042
The last thing I said to Fury
before the Snap was,

274
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,958
"If you keep spending all your time
chasing aliens,

275
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:24,208
"you might lose the one you married."

276
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,417
Why does Gravik want to kill you?

277
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,625
Insubordination, I guess.

278
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,417
And yet you decided to obey the order

279
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,542
that says you have to wait around here
for your execution.

280
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,083
The thing is, I love this house.

281
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:52,958
Loved it ever since I first set foot in it
on a viewing 15 years ago.

282
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:54,333
With Fury?

283
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:55,667
With Fury in mind.

284
00:24:56,542 --> 00:25:00,583
I wasn't sure if he'd ever commit
to calling any one place home,

285
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,500
let alone any place with me.

286
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,917
But I figured if I was gonna give it
a fighting chance,

287
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,375
I'd need to find a place that offered
the three things he valued most.

288
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:16,542
Lots of privacy, lots of security,
and lots of...

289
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:17,667
Leather.

290
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,417
Light.

291
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,708
He'd sit there by the window,
reading a book.

292
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:28,208
Letting the sun kiss his skin.

293
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,292
And I'd get lost,
just watching him like that for hours.

294
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,458
He ever get lost
watching you in your own skin?

295
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:41,917
- That's none of your business.
- Well, I...

296
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,208
- I didn't mean to offend.
- Of course you did.

297
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,833
You're young,
you think you know everything.

298
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:51,750
But you don't know what it takes
to build a life with someone else,

299
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,250
to sustain it...

300
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:07,250
Anyway, when it comes
to facing down my executioners,

301
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:11,333
I'd rather meet the bastards
standing right here in my happiness

302
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,917
than to meet them
running down some dark alley...

303
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,417
Here.

304
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:40,958
- You good?
- Good.

305
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,708
Let me check I understand this.

306
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:19,208
So, a billion dollars
of research and development,

307
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:21,292
and all the Widow's Veil can cloak
is your face?

308
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,625
What about the rest of you?

309
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,708
That's the newer version, not this one.

310
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,750
Huh. Never mind.

311
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:31,792
- This is what we're doing?
- Yes, this is what we're doing.

312
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,125
Seat belt, please.

313
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,083
Off we go.

314
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:55,292
Be careful, G'iah.

315
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,958
Why do you think
Rhodey is in charge of this?

316
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,417
He asked for corroboration
on the New Skrullos site.

317
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,292
And you gave it to him?

318
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,625
Yes, Fury.

319
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:22,375
In the absence of my scaled superior,
I'm the new head of SIS.

320
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:25,375
And last I checked,
Britain and the U.S. were allies.

321
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:28,250
Last I checked, Rhodey is a Skrull.

322
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
What?

323
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:32,917
And you said I'd lost my touch.

324
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:37,375
Well, who in the hell
isn't a Skrull these days?

325
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:41,833
Why in God's name would Gravik
want to blow up his own people?

326
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:43,125
Leverage.

327
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:46,333
If I don't give Gravik the Harvest,

328
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:51,333
then Rhodey is going to incinerate
the Skrull compound,

329
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:54,583
including all the Skrulls
and humans trapped inside.

330
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:58,917
Russia will retaliate,
and the world will lose its mind.

331
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:02,625
Yes, yes. War, war. But the Harvest?

332
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,375
Nearly every Avenger spilled blood

333
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:09,042
in the Battle of Earth.

334
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,583
Even Carol Danvers.

335
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:17,500
In the aftermath,
some were sent in to collect that DNA.

336
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:23,042
Some with the ability to blend in.

337
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:29,458
Nobody knew about them
but me and the collectors,

338
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:31,250
- led by...
- Gravik.

339
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,583
Gravik, yes.

340
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:36,583
Which is probably where he got the idea
for the Super Skrull machine.

341
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:42,583
- So you are responsible for all this?
- Yeah.

342
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,792
Why do you think I came back?

343
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,833
A Scandinavian cemetery?
I should've brought my scythe.

344
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:16,833
Only dead men keep secrets.
You taught me that, Sonya.

345
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,750
Fury, why haven't you called
any of your special friends down?

346
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,833
This is personal.

347
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,667
We can't keep depending
on these superheroes

348
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,042
to swoop in and save our asses.

349
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,458
None of them have lived the life I have.

350
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:44,250
None of them can defend the world
the way I can.

351
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:48,042
The only power I have

352
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,667
was planted between my ears
by a single mother,

353
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,542
and wrapped around my finger by a woman

354
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,958
who's far greater
than I could ever hope to be.

355
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:03,750
If that ain't enough,
then I don't know what hope we have.

356
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:09,500
If that ain't enough,
maybe I am just dust.

357
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:14,375
Don't you have another one of these?

358
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:18,250
I got these all over the place, you know?
Dead men need options.

359
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,292
Why Finland?

360
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,417
Priscilla and I honeymooned here.

361
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,167
Skrulls like the cold.

362
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,500
Now, you understand.

363
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:58,833
So, let me clarify.

364
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:01,292
You knew how dangerous this vial was,

365
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:04,083
so swapped its location
to protect it from Gravik,

366
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,083
and now you're going to give it to him.

367
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,125
Exactly.

368
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,667
Well, they do say Darwin never sleeps.

369
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,583
Let's give our extinction a nice leg up.

370
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,333
It's time.

371
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,042
Let's finish this.
