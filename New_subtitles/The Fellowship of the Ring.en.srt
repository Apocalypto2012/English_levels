1
00:00:32,394 --> 00:00:35,175
<i>The world is changed.</i>

2
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:38,245
<i>I feel it in the water.</i>

3
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:41,697
<i>I feel it in the earth.</i>

4
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:46,109
<i>I smell it in the air.</i>

5
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:48,411
<i>Much that once was...</i>

6
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:50,041
<i>...is lost.</i>

7
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:53,590
<i>For none now live who remember it.</i>

8
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:10,183
<i>It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.</i>

9
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:12,293
<i>Three were given to the Elves:</i>

10
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,033
<i>Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.</i>

11
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:19,102
<i>Seven to the Dwarf-lords:</i>

12
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:23,994
<i>Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.</i>

13
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:25,720
<i>And nine...</i>

14
00:01:25,912 --> 00:01:28,693
<i>...nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...</i>

15
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:32,626
<i>...who, above all else, desire power.</i>

16
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:38,668
<i>For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.</i>

17
00:01:40,202 --> 00:01:43,080
<i>But they were all of them deceived.</i>

18
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:45,477
<i>For another ring was made.</i>

19
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:49,602
<i>In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...</i>

20
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:54,301
<i>...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...</i>

21
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:56,603
<i>...to control all others.</i>

22
00:01:56,795 --> 00:02:00,439
<i>And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...</i>

23
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:04,659
<i>...and his will to dominate all life.</i>

24
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:09,263
<i>One Ring to rule them all.</i>

25
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,757
<i>One by one...</i>

26
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,361
<i>...the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.</i>

27
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:19,526
<i>But there were some who resisted.</i>

28
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:24,417
<i>A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.</i>

29
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:29,021
<i>And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.</i>

30
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:00,767
<i>Victory was near.</i>

31
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,001
<i>But the power of the Ring...</i>

32
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,207
<i>...could not be undone.</i>

33
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,527
<i>It was in this moment...</i>

34
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:37,021
<i>...when all hope had faded...</i>

35
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:41,145
<i>...that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.</i>

36
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:17,111
<i>Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.</i>

37
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:25,935
<i>The Ring passed to Isildur...</i>

38
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:30,059
<i>...who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.</i>

39
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,936
<i>But the hearts of Men...</i>

40
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:35,526
<i>...are easily corrupted.</i>

41
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:40,034
<i>And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.</i>

42
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:06,793
<i>It betrayed Isildur...</i>

43
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:10,917
<i>...to his death.</i>

44
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,590
<i>And some things
that should not have been forgotten...</i>

45
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:21,083
<i>...were lost.</i>

46
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:24,057
<i>History became legend...</i>

47
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:26,167
<i>...legend became myth.</i>

48
00:05:26,454 --> 00:05:29,044
<i>And for
two and a half thousand years...</i>

49
00:05:29,332 --> 00:05:32,784
<i>...the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.</i>

50
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:36,141
<i>Until, when chance came...</i>

51
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:39,690
<i>...it ensnared a new bearer.</i>

52
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:45,636
My precious.

53
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,322
<i>The Ring came to the creature
Gollum...</i>

54
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,254
<i>...who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.</i>

55
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:55,323
<i>And there it consumed him.</i>

56
00:05:55,611 --> 00:05:57,529
It came to me.

57
00:05:57,817 --> 00:06:01,845
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:06,545
My precious.

59
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:13,354
<i>The Ring brought to Gollum
unnatural long life.</i>

60
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:17,287
<i>For 500 years it poisoned his mind.</i>

61
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:21,794
<i>And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.</i>

62
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:25,151
<i>Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.</i>

63
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,124
<i>Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...</i>

64
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:31,002
<i>...whispers of a nameless fear.</i>

65
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,359
<i>And the Ring of Power perceived...</i>

66
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:37,332
<i>...its time had now come.</i>

67
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,223
<i>It abandoned Gollum.</i>

68
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:47,019
<i>But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.</i>

69
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:52,198
<i>It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.</i>

70
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:53,541
What's this?

71
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,171
<i>A Hobbit.</i>

72
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:57,953
<i>Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.</i>

73
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,871
A ring.

74
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:01,885
Lost!

75
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:07,639
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:10,133
<i>For the time will soon come...</i>

77
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:15,216
<i>...when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.</i>

78
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:22,793
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:26,054
...in the year 1400...

80
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:28,548
...by Shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:34,111
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
Westfarthing...

82
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:36,317
...the Shire...

83
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:39,194
...Middle-earth.

84
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:46,867
The Third Age of this world.

85
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:01,733
<i>There and Back Again:</i>

86
00:08:02,404 --> 00:08:04,035
<i>A Hobbit's Tale.</i>

87
00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:07,967
By Bilbo Baggins.

88
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,297
Now...

89
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:16,887
...where to begin?

90
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:19,188
Ah, yes...

91
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,231
"Concerning...

92
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:27,820
...Hobbits."

93
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:32,232
<i>Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...</i>

94
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:34,342
<i>...for many hundreds of years...</i>

95
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:37,411
<i>...quite content to ignore
and be ignored...</i>

96
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:40,576
<i>...by the world of the Big Folk.</i>

97
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:46,235
<i>Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...</i>

98
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:49,592
<i>...Hobbits must seem
of little importance...</i>

99
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,524
<i>...being neither renowned
as great warriors...</i>

100
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,744
<i>...nor counted among the very wise.</i>

101
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,842
Frodo! Someone at the door.

102
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:08,486
<i>In fact, it has been remarked by some...</i>

103
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:12,802
<i>...that Hobbits' only real passion
is for food.</i>

104
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:15,392
<i>A rather unfair observation...</i>

105
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,036
<i>...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...</i>

106
00:09:19,612 --> 00:09:22,105
<i>...and the smoking of pipe-weed.</i>

107
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:25,270
<i>But where our hearts truly lie...</i>

108
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:27,476
<i>...is in peace and quiet...</i>

109
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,354
<i>...and good, tilled earth.</i>

110
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:35,341
<i>For all Hobbits share a love
of things that grow.</i>

111
00:09:38,602 --> 00:09:42,534
<i>And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.</i>

112
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:47,809
<i>But today of all days,
it is brought home to me:</i>

113
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:53,948
<i>It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.</i>

114
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:01,141
Frodo, the door!

115
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:06,704
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

116
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:08,526
Frodo!

117
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:17,445
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

118
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:25,694
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

119
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:30,585
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

120
00:10:30,873 --> 00:10:34,038
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

121
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:39,025
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

122
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:43,245
<i>- And I must follow if I can
- You're late.</i>

123
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:50,055
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

124
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:55,234
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

125
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:09,045
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

126
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:16,334
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

127
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:20,075
How is the old rascal?

128
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,911
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

129
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:26,501
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

130
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:28,515
Well, that should please him.

131
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:30,529
Half the Shire's been invited.

132
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:33,310
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

133
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:39,449
<i>And so life in the Shire goes on...</i>

134
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,614
<i>...very much as it has
this past Age...</i>

135
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:47,985
<i>...full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.</i>

136
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:50,095
<i>If it comes at all.</i>

137
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:54,602
<i>For things are made to endure
in the Shire...</i>

138
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,055
<i>...passing from one generation
to the next.</i>

139
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:03,234
<i>There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...</i>

140
00:12:03,618 --> 00:12:04,865
<i>...in Bag End.</i>

141
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:10,044
And there always will be.

142
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:14,072
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

143
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:17,429
I mean, more than usual.

144
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:20,210
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

145
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:25,581
<i>He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.</i>

146
00:12:37,954 --> 00:12:39,488
Where's it gone?

147
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:07,206
He's up to something.

148
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:17,373
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

149
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:19,291
But I know you have something
to do with it.

150
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:20,538
Good gracious me.

151
00:13:21,113 --> 00:13:23,607
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

152
00:13:23,895 --> 00:13:24,758
Indeed.

153
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:27,060
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

154
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:33,198
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

155
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:36,843
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

156
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:40,967
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

157
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,173
Oh, really?

158
00:13:48,831 --> 00:13:50,558
Gandalf! Gandalf!

159
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:57,655
Fireworks, Gandalf!

160
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:03,122
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

161
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:22,112
Gandalf?

162
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:26,524
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

163
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,566
So am I.

164
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:04,504
No, thank you!

165
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:08,437
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

166
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,081
And what about very old friends?

167
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,685
Gandalf?

168
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:20,617
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

169
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:25,700
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

170
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:29,441
You haven't aged a day.

171
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:37,689
Come on, come in!

172
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:40,183
Welcome, welcome.

173
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:43,636
Oh, here we are.

174
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,664
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

175
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:51,404
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

176
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:55,528
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

177
00:15:56,775 --> 00:16:00,899
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

178
00:16:01,283 --> 00:16:03,777
Just tea, thank you.

179
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,545
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

180
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,711
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

181
00:16:15,094 --> 00:16:19,890
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

182
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:23,438
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

183
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:27,371
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

184
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:31,783
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

185
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,756
I've just found some sponge cake.

186
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:38,880
I could make you some eggs
if you'd...

187
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:45,114
- just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

188
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:48,375
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

189
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,156
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

190
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,883
I'm not at home!

191
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:01,131
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

192
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:03,433
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

193
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:06,406
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

194
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:09,283
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

195
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,297
...never giving me a moment's peace.

196
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:15,326
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

197
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,833
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

198
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:23,862
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

199
00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:26,259
All the arrangements are made.

200
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,712
Oh, thank you.

201
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,398
Frodo suspects something.

202
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,987
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

203
00:17:35,275 --> 00:17:37,673
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

204
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:40,838
You will tell him, won't you?

205
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:43,715
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

206
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:47,264
I know.

207
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:52,731
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

208
00:17:53,498 --> 00:17:56,663
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

209
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:00,403
The woods, the fields.

210
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:02,801
Little rivers.

211
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:09,707
I am old, Gandalf.

212
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:15,941
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

213
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:20,449
I feel thin.

214
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:22,367
Sort of stretched...

215
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,779
...like butter scraped
over too much bread.

216
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:31,191
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

217
00:18:31,574 --> 00:18:34,547
And I don't expect I shall return.

218
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:39,727
In fact, I mean not to.

219
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:46,248
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

220
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:05,239
Gandalf, my old friend...

221
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:08,212
...this will be a night to remember.

222
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:31,230
Hello, hello.

223
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:35,163
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

224
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:38,615
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

225
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:44,658
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

226
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:47,343
Go on!

227
00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:58,852
So there I was...

228
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,785
...at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

229
00:20:03,264 --> 00:20:05,087
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

230
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:07,484
...about how they were
going to cook us.

231
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:12,472
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

232
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:16,788
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

233
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:20,528
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

234
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,885
...and turned them all to stone!

235
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:30,311
Quickly.

236
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:36,257
Up they go!

237
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:40,190
No, the big one.

238
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:51,603
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

239
00:20:52,082 --> 00:20:53,713
Are all these children yours?

240
00:20:54,097 --> 00:20:56,782
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

241
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:00,043
Bilbo?

242
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:03,304
Sackville-Bagginses!

243
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:04,551
Quickly, hide!

244
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:16,060
Thank you, my boy.

245
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,800
You're a good lad, Frodo.

246
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,637
I'm very selfish, you know.

247
00:21:24,212 --> 00:21:27,377
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

248
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:29,871
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died...

249
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,501
...but it wasn't out of charity.

250
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:33,420
I think it was because...

251
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:35,817
...of all my numerous relations...

252
00:21:36,297 --> 00:21:39,462
...you were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

253
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:41,476
Bilbo, have you been
at the Gaffer's home brew?

254
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,298
No.

255
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:46,080
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

256
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,437
The point is, Frodo...

257
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,232
...you'll be all right.

258
00:21:57,685 --> 00:21:59,507
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

259
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,138
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

260
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:02,768
This was your idea.

261
00:22:18,018 --> 00:22:19,457
Bilbo.

262
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,197
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

263
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:26,650
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

264
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:43,050
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

265
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:48,613
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

266
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,627
I might've known.

267
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:58,300
Speech, Bilbo!

268
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:00,410
Speech!

269
00:23:00,602 --> 00:23:01,561
Speech!

270
00:23:06,644 --> 00:23:08,754
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

271
00:23:09,618 --> 00:23:11,536
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

272
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,125
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

273
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:15,372
...Hornblowers...

274
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:18,058
...Bolgers...

275
00:23:18,537 --> 00:23:19,976
...Bracegirdles...

276
00:23:20,264 --> 00:23:22,661
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

277
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:27,745
Today is my 111th birthday!

278
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:31,005
Happy birthday!

279
00:23:31,197 --> 00:23:35,130
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

280
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:38,199
...such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

281
00:23:39,254 --> 00:23:41,747
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

282
00:23:42,035 --> 00:23:46,255
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

283
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:58,244
I have things to do.

284
00:24:04,478 --> 00:24:06,396
I've put this off far too long.

285
00:24:10,137 --> 00:24:13,781
I regret to announce this is the end!

286
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:16,083
I'm going now.

287
00:24:17,234 --> 00:24:19,920
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

288
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:23,372
Goodbye.

289
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,188
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

290
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:01,640
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

291
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:06,532
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

292
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:08,930
It was just a bit of fun.

293
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:12,670
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

294
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:17,370
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

295
00:25:17,753 --> 00:25:20,247
As often as I can spare them.

296
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:23,412
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

297
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,769
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

298
00:25:27,536 --> 00:25:31,085
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

299
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:35,017
No. Wait, it's...

300
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:40,005
...here in my pocket.

301
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:47,485
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

302
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:52,473
Yet, after all, why not?

303
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:58,515
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

304
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:01,105
Is that so hard?

305
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:02,639
Well, no.

306
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:06,476
And yes.

307
00:26:08,394 --> 00:26:11,175
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

308
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,189
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

309
00:26:13,477 --> 00:26:17,314
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

310
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:19,519
It's mine.

311
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:23,164
My own.

312
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:27,192
- My precious.
- Precious?

313
00:26:27,576 --> 00:26:30,261
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

314
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,851
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

315
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:35,728
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

316
00:26:36,016 --> 00:26:38,606
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

317
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:42,826
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

318
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:46,566
I am not trying to rob you.

319
00:26:51,553 --> 00:26:53,088
I'm trying to help you.

320
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:04,405
All your long years,
we've been friends.

321
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:06,803
Trust me as you once did.

322
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:10,448
Let it go.

323
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:13,805
You're right, Gandalf.

324
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:18,408
The ring must go to Frodo.

325
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,532
It's late. The road is long.

326
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,122
Yes, it is time.

327
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:32,507
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

328
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,761
I've thought up an ending for my book:

329
00:28:10,392 --> 00:28:14,995
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

330
00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:18,544
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

331
00:28:19,695 --> 00:28:21,038
Goodbye, Gandalf.

332
00:28:23,531 --> 00:28:26,217
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

333
00:28:33,794 --> 00:28:37,630
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

334
00:28:40,315 --> 00:28:42,521
Until our next meeting.

335
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:12,158
<i>It's mine. My own.</i>

336
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:15,706
<i>My precious.</i>

337
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:18,679
Riddles in the dark.

338
00:29:19,063 --> 00:29:20,406
Bilbo!

339
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:22,036
Bilbo!

340
00:29:25,585 --> 00:29:28,270
My precious.

341
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,915
Precious.

342
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,601
He's gone, hasn't he?

343
00:29:37,286 --> 00:29:40,163
He talked for so long about leaving...

344
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:43,041
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

345
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,179
Gandalf?

346
00:29:57,139 --> 00:29:58,674
Bilbo's ring.

347
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:01,264
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

348
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:04,429
He's left you Bag End.

349
00:30:07,977 --> 00:30:10,183
Along with all his possessions.

350
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:13,156
The ring is yours now.

351
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:19,007
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

352
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:21,405
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

353
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:25,625
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

354
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,077
I don't understand.

355
00:30:32,434 --> 00:30:33,298
Neither do I.

356
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:38,573
Keep it secret.

357
00:30:38,956 --> 00:30:40,587
Keep it safe.

358
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:16,169
<i>Shire!</i>

359
00:31:16,553 --> 00:31:19,430
<i>Baggins!</i>

360
00:32:06,138 --> 00:32:08,824
<i>"The year 3434 of the Second Age.</i>

361
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:13,140
<i>Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...</i>

362
00:32:13,524 --> 00:32:16,880
<i>...and the finding
of the Ring of Power. "</i>

363
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:22,060
<i>"It has come to me.</i>

364
00:32:22,347 --> 00:32:25,512
<i>The One Ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.</i>

365
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,965
<i>All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...</i>

366
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:32,801
<i>...for I will risk
no hurt to the Ring.</i>

367
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:35,391
<i>It is precious to me...</i>

368
00:32:36,446 --> 00:32:38,844
<i>...though I buy it with great pain.</i>

369
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:45,749
<i>The markings upon the band
begin to fade.</i>

370
00:32:46,325 --> 00:32:50,641
<i>The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.</i>

371
00:32:51,024 --> 00:32:54,765
<i>A secret now
that only fire can tell. "</i>

372
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:13,371
Shire.

373
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:15,577
Baggins.

374
00:33:16,153 --> 00:33:19,797
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

375
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:23,058
That way.

376
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:30,827
<i>To heal my heart and drown my woe</i>

377
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:33,225
<i>Rain may fall and wind may blow</i>

378
00:33:33,608 --> 00:33:35,335
<i>But there still be</i>

379
00:33:35,623 --> 00:33:36,869
<i>Many miles to go</i>

380
00:33:37,157 --> 00:33:38,884
<i>Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain</i>

381
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:41,185
<i>And the stream that falls
From hill to plain</i>

382
00:33:41,473 --> 00:33:43,104
<i>Better than rain or rippling brook</i>

383
00:33:43,391 --> 00:33:45,597
<i>Is a mug of beer inside this Took</i>

384
00:33:48,954 --> 00:33:51,544
There's been some strange folk
crossing the Shire.

385
00:33:52,215 --> 00:33:55,668
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

386
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:57,586
War is brewing.

387
00:33:58,257 --> 00:34:00,847
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

388
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:03,628
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

389
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:08,040
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

390
00:34:08,424 --> 00:34:11,109
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

391
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:12,644
And proud of it.

392
00:34:13,028 --> 00:34:15,042
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Cheers.

393
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:19,070
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

394
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,290
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

395
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:28,853
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

396
00:34:29,044 --> 00:34:33,073
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

397
00:34:33,552 --> 00:34:35,662
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

398
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:40,074
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

399
00:34:41,321 --> 00:34:42,472
Does she?

400
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:45,829
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mister Frodo.

401
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,012
Is it secret? Is it safe?

402
00:35:20,548 --> 00:35:22,562
What are you doing?

403
00:35:34,743 --> 00:35:37,045
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

404
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:38,483
It's quite cool.

405
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,471
What can you see?

406
00:35:45,293 --> 00:35:47,499
Can you see anything?

407
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:51,431
Nothing.

408
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:54,021
There's nothing.

409
00:35:55,076 --> 00:35:56,419
Wait.

410
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:02,461
There are markings.

411
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,160
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

412
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:09,846
There are few who can.

413
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:14,929
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

414
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:16,656
Mordor!

415
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:18,766
In the common tongue, it says:

416
00:36:19,149 --> 00:36:22,314
"One Ring to rule them all...

417
00:36:22,698 --> 00:36:24,808
...One Ring to find them...

418
00:36:25,192 --> 00:36:27,206
...One Ring to bring them all...

419
00:36:27,493 --> 00:36:30,275
...and in the darkness bind them."

420
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:33,823
This is the One Ring...

421
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:39,003
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

422
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:43,127
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

423
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,388
Bilbo found it.

424
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:48,594
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

425
00:36:48,977 --> 00:36:53,101
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

426
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:56,554
...prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

427
00:36:57,417 --> 00:37:01,446
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

428
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,939
The Ring has awoken.

429
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:06,817
It's heard its master's call.

430
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,749
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

431
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:18,230
No, Frodo.

432
00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:22,258
The spirit of Sauron endured.

433
00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:27,533
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

434
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:30,027
Sauron has returned.

435
00:37:30,986 --> 00:37:32,904
His Orcs have multiplied.

436
00:37:33,192 --> 00:37:36,836
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

437
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,632
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

438
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,934
He is seeking it.

439
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:47,770
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

440
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,552
For the Ring yearns above all else...

441
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:54,004
...to return to the hand
of its master.

442
00:37:54,388 --> 00:37:56,018
They are one...

443
00:37:56,306 --> 00:37:59,088
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

444
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:00,334
Frodo...

445
00:38:01,006 --> 00:38:02,636
...he must never find it.

446
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,883
All right.

447
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:08,199
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

448
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:11,076
No one knows it's here, do they?

449
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:17,598
Do they, Gandalf?

450
00:38:18,749 --> 00:38:21,818
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

451
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:25,942
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

452
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,148
But the enemy found him first.

453
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:32,272
<i>I don't know how long
they tortured him.</i>

454
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,684
<i>But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:</i>

455
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:38,986
Shire!

456
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:40,808
Baggins!

457
00:38:41,096 --> 00:38:42,727
Shire.

458
00:38:43,014 --> 00:38:45,604
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

459
00:38:48,385 --> 00:38:49,440
Who goes there?

460
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,222
Take it, Gandalf!

461
00:38:52,605 --> 00:38:53,660
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

462
00:38:53,852 --> 00:38:55,962
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

463
00:38:56,346 --> 00:38:59,319
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

464
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,964
I dare not take it.

465
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:05,649
Not even to keep it safe.

466
00:39:06,896 --> 00:39:08,718
Understand, Frodo...

467
00:39:09,486 --> 00:39:12,746
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

468
00:39:18,213 --> 00:39:23,393
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

469
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,845
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

470
00:39:28,763 --> 00:39:30,202
No, it can't.

471
00:39:35,477 --> 00:39:36,724
What must I do?

472
00:39:38,354 --> 00:39:41,615
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

473
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:44,972
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

474
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:46,315
Bree.

475
00:39:46,603 --> 00:39:49,192
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

476
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,686
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

477
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:55,426
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

478
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,632
I don't have any answers.

479
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:04,250
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

480
00:40:04,634 --> 00:40:06,552
He'll know what to do.

481
00:40:07,223 --> 00:40:09,813
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

482
00:40:10,197 --> 00:40:12,498
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

483
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:16,239
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

484
00:40:17,102 --> 00:40:19,979
I can cut across country
easily enough.

485
00:40:22,473 --> 00:40:23,720
My dear Frodo.

486
00:40:24,104 --> 00:40:26,789
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

487
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:29,762
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

488
00:40:30,146 --> 00:40:32,256
And yet, after a hundred years...

489
00:40:32,544 --> 00:40:34,366
...they can still surprise you.

490
00:40:36,092 --> 00:40:37,339
Get down.

491
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,205
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

492
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:56,713
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

493
00:40:57,097 --> 00:40:59,303
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

494
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,180
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

495
00:41:02,564 --> 00:41:03,523
Nothing important.

496
00:41:04,194 --> 00:41:07,934
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but...

497
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:12,538
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

498
00:41:13,497 --> 00:41:15,032
No?

499
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:17,238
Perhaps not.

500
00:41:18,485 --> 00:41:21,650
I've thought of a better use for you.

501
00:41:23,472 --> 00:41:26,157
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

502
00:41:27,788 --> 00:41:29,802
Be careful, both of you.

503
00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:32,679
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

504
00:41:33,063 --> 00:41:35,748
Birds, beasts.

505
00:41:37,571 --> 00:41:39,201
Is it safe?

506
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,078
Never put it on...

507
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:45,531
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

508
00:41:45,819 --> 00:41:47,162
Always remember, Frodo...

509
00:41:47,737 --> 00:41:50,614
...the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

510
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,108
It wants to be found.

511
00:42:32,144 --> 00:42:34,158
This is it.

512
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:36,459
This is what?

513
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:38,761
If I take one more step...

514
00:42:39,337 --> 00:42:42,885
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

515
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:48,544
Come on, Sam.

516
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:58,423
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

517
00:42:58,998 --> 00:43:02,451
<i>- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.</i>

518
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:06,863
<i>You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...</i>

519
00:43:07,247 --> 00:43:11,083
<i>...there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to. "</i>

520
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,141
Sam.

521
00:43:29,594 --> 00:43:30,649
Wood-elves.

522
00:43:43,884 --> 00:43:47,145
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

523
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:49,351
To the Grey Havens.

524
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,749
They're leaving Middle-earth.

525
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:54,147
Never to return.

526
00:43:57,024 --> 00:43:58,942
I don't know why...

527
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:01,819
...it makes me sad.

528
00:44:03,929 --> 00:44:08,245
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

529
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:10,643
Just shut your eyes...

530
00:44:10,931 --> 00:44:13,425
...and imagine you're back
in your own bed...

531
00:44:13,712 --> 00:44:17,357
...with a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

532
00:44:26,468 --> 00:44:28,962
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

533
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,839
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

534
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:36,347
Me neither, Sam.

535
00:45:03,873 --> 00:45:06,655
<i>Smoke rises
from the Mountain of Doom.</i>

536
00:45:06,942 --> 00:45:08,381
<i>The hour grows late.</i>

537
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:12,026
<i>And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...</i>

538
00:45:12,313 --> 00:45:14,519
<i>...seeking my counsel.</i>

539
00:45:14,807 --> 00:45:18,452
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

540
00:45:18,835 --> 00:45:19,986
My old friend.

541
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:21,808
Saruman.

542
00:45:26,508 --> 00:45:29,194
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

543
00:45:30,153 --> 00:45:32,263
So the Ring of Power has been found.

544
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:35,524
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

545
00:45:35,811 --> 00:45:38,689
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

546
00:45:39,456 --> 00:45:43,484
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

547
00:45:44,347 --> 00:45:48,184
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

548
00:45:48,567 --> 00:45:50,006
Time?

549
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:53,363
What time do you think we have?

550
00:45:53,842 --> 00:45:57,391
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

551
00:45:57,775 --> 00:45:59,789
He cannot yet take physical form...

552
00:46:00,077 --> 00:46:02,570
...but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

553
00:46:03,338 --> 00:46:07,941
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

554
00:46:08,709 --> 00:46:14,175
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

555
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,683
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

556
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:24,534
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

557
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,411
The Eye of Sauron.

558
00:46:27,603 --> 00:46:29,905
He is gathering all evil to him.

559
00:46:30,576 --> 00:46:32,302
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army...

560
00:46:32,494 --> 00:46:34,988
...great enough for an assault
upon Middle-earth.

561
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:37,673
You know this?

562
00:46:38,345 --> 00:46:39,687
How?

563
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:41,797
I have seen it.

564
00:46:42,373 --> 00:46:45,250
A palantír is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

565
00:46:46,018 --> 00:46:47,360
Why?

566
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:50,429
Why should we fear to use it?

567
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:56,664
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

568
00:46:57,047 --> 00:47:00,020
We do not know who else
may be watching.

569
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,104
The hour is later than you think.

570
00:47:05,391 --> 00:47:07,501
Sauron's forces are already moving.

571
00:47:09,803 --> 00:47:12,297
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

572
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:13,831
The Nine?

573
00:47:14,023 --> 00:47:16,709
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

574
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:19,490
...disguised as riders in black.

575
00:47:19,874 --> 00:47:23,518
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.

576
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:27,259
And kill the one who carries it.

577
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:29,177
Frodo!

578
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,386
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

579
00:47:46,345 --> 00:47:48,839
There are none who can.

580
00:47:51,332 --> 00:47:53,826
Against the power of Mordor...

581
00:47:54,114 --> 00:47:56,511
...there can be no victory.

582
00:47:58,526 --> 00:48:01,499
We must join with him, Gandalf.

583
00:48:02,841 --> 00:48:04,952
We must join with Sauron.

584
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:10,131
It would be wise, my friend.

585
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:11,953
Tell me...

586
00:48:12,241 --> 00:48:13,200
...friend...

587
00:48:14,255 --> 00:48:18,379
...when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

588
00:48:56,455 --> 00:48:57,990
I gave you the chance...

589
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:01,538
...of aiding me willingly...

590
00:49:01,922 --> 00:49:05,663
...but you have elected
the way of pain!

591
00:49:28,201 --> 00:49:29,544
Mr. Frodo?

592
00:49:30,216 --> 00:49:31,846
Frodo? Frodo!

593
00:49:33,285 --> 00:49:36,258
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

594
00:49:36,642 --> 00:49:39,327
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

595
00:49:40,286 --> 00:49:43,835
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

596
00:49:44,218 --> 00:49:47,575
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

597
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:51,508
Frodo.

598
00:49:51,795 --> 00:49:53,809
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

599
00:49:54,097 --> 00:49:55,344
Get off him.

600
00:49:55,919 --> 00:49:57,262
Come on, Frodo.

601
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,276
What's the meaning of this?

602
00:49:59,852 --> 00:50:02,633
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

603
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,798
You get back here!

604
00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:08,100
Get out of my field!

605
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:10,881
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

606
00:50:11,265 --> 00:50:13,951
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

607
00:50:14,238 --> 00:50:15,197
And some cabbages.

608
00:50:15,485 --> 00:50:18,075
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

609
00:50:18,554 --> 00:50:22,199
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

610
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,501
...he's clearly overreacting.

611
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,131
Run!

612
00:50:39,175 --> 00:50:41,477
Oh, that was close.

613
00:50:42,724 --> 00:50:45,505
I think I've broken something.

614
00:50:46,656 --> 00:50:48,766
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

615
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:52,411
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

616
00:50:52,698 --> 00:50:54,808
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

617
00:51:03,344 --> 00:51:04,687
That's mine.

618
00:51:07,372 --> 00:51:08,811
That's nice, Merry.

619
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,305
Here's a nice one, Sam.

620
00:51:11,593 --> 00:51:13,894
I think we should get off the road.

621
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:24,061
Get off the road!

622
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:25,787
Quick!

623
00:51:37,872 --> 00:51:39,311
Be quiet!

624
00:52:42,995 --> 00:52:44,913
What was that?

625
00:53:16,372 --> 00:53:17,714
Anything?

626
00:53:18,482 --> 00:53:19,824
Nothing.

627
00:53:20,592 --> 00:53:22,702
What is going on?

628
00:53:23,277 --> 00:53:26,826
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

629
00:53:28,264 --> 00:53:29,607
Frodo?

630
00:53:30,278 --> 00:53:31,238
Get down!

631
00:53:47,638 --> 00:53:49,652
I have to leave the Shire.

632
00:53:50,707 --> 00:53:52,721
Sam and I must get to Bree.

633
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,352
Right.

634
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:57,805
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

635
00:54:05,861 --> 00:54:07,108
Run!

636
00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:10,081
This way! Follow me!

637
00:54:13,726 --> 00:54:14,685
Run!

638
00:54:27,537 --> 00:54:29,071
Get the rope, Sam!

639
00:54:31,661 --> 00:54:33,004
Frodo!

640
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,114
Run, Frodo!

641
00:54:35,497 --> 00:54:36,456
Go!
- Hurry!

642
00:54:36,744 --> 00:54:39,142
Frodo, come on!

643
00:54:40,101 --> 00:54:42,019
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

644
00:54:56,406 --> 00:55:00,242
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

645
00:55:14,533 --> 00:55:15,875
Come on.

646
00:55:26,617 --> 00:55:29,782
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

647
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:35,921
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

648
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:39,853
What's more, out of the Shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

649
00:55:40,524 --> 00:55:43,306
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

650
00:55:44,457 --> 00:55:46,759
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

651
00:55:47,142 --> 00:55:49,444
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

652
00:55:49,732 --> 00:55:52,321
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

653
00:55:52,705 --> 00:55:54,623
Can't be too careful.

654
00:56:13,613 --> 00:56:16,874
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

655
00:56:39,989 --> 00:56:41,523
Excuse me.

656
00:56:42,578 --> 00:56:45,072
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

657
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,922
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

658
00:56:51,498 --> 00:56:55,718
Always proud to cater
to the Little Folk, Mister?

659
00:56:56,965 --> 00:56:58,787
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

660
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,432
- Underhill, yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

661
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,693
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

662
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,707
Gandalf.

663
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:10,104
Oh, yes...

664
00:57:10,488 --> 00:57:12,310
...I remember. Elderly chap.

665
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,475
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

666
00:57:15,955 --> 00:57:17,585
Not seen him for six months.

667
00:57:24,299 --> 00:57:25,450
What do we do now?

668
00:57:32,356 --> 00:57:33,506
Sam...

669
00:57:33,794 --> 00:57:35,521
...he'll be here. He'll come.

670
00:57:38,206 --> 00:57:40,124
Get out of my way!

671
00:57:42,522 --> 00:57:44,057
What's that?

672
00:57:44,248 --> 00:57:46,550
This, my friend, is a pint.

673
00:57:46,934 --> 00:57:48,373
It comes in pints?

674
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:52,209
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

675
00:57:58,443 --> 00:58:01,896
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

676
00:58:05,445 --> 00:58:06,883
Excuse me.

677
00:58:08,705 --> 00:58:11,487
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

678
00:58:12,638 --> 00:58:16,666
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

679
00:58:17,146 --> 00:58:21,270
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

680
00:58:23,763 --> 00:58:24,818
Strider.

681
00:58:37,478 --> 00:58:40,356
<i>Baggins.</i>

682
00:58:43,904 --> 00:58:45,247
<i>Baggins.</i>

683
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,154
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

684
00:59:00,113 --> 00:59:02,703
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

685
00:59:02,991 --> 00:59:05,772
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

686
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,170
...and my third cousin, twice removed...

687
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,212
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

688
00:59:42,697 --> 00:59:44,903
You cannot hide.

689
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:50,658
I see you.

690
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,974
There is no life...

691
00:59:55,262 --> 00:59:57,180
...in the void.

692
00:59:57,467 --> 00:59:58,906
Only...

693
00:59:59,865 --> 01:00:01,208
...death.

694
01:00:07,058 --> 01:00:11,470
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

695
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,129
What do you want?

696
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:19,239
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

697
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:22,500
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

698
01:00:22,884 --> 01:00:25,185
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

699
01:00:25,473 --> 01:00:28,830
...but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

700
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,899
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

701
01:00:33,146 --> 01:00:34,105
Yes.

702
01:00:34,393 --> 01:00:37,942
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

703
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,272
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

704
01:00:45,998 --> 01:00:49,738
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

705
01:00:50,026 --> 01:00:52,712
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

706
01:00:53,095 --> 01:00:54,150
They're coming.

707
01:02:14,235 --> 01:02:15,674
What are they?

708
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,798
They were once Men.

709
01:02:20,086 --> 01:02:22,100
Great kings of Men.

710
01:02:22,675 --> 01:02:25,553
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

711
01:02:26,224 --> 01:02:29,101
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

712
01:02:29,485 --> 01:02:32,458
One by one, falling into darkness.

713
01:02:32,842 --> 01:02:35,048
Now they are slaves to his will.

714
01:02:37,445 --> 01:02:39,076
They are the NazgûI.

715
01:02:39,364 --> 01:02:41,857
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

716
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:43,871
At all times they feel...

717
01:02:44,255 --> 01:02:45,981
<i>...the presence of the Ring...</i>

718
01:02:46,269 --> 01:02:50,393
<i>...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.</i>

719
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,862
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.

720
01:03:10,822 --> 01:03:14,563
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

721
01:03:14,946 --> 01:03:17,536
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

722
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:21,564
...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

723
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,921
We have no choice but to trust him.

724
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:28,470
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

725
01:03:30,867 --> 01:03:33,841
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

726
01:03:34,608 --> 01:03:37,102
We're going to see the Elves.

727
01:03:57,914 --> 01:04:01,750
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

728
01:04:02,134 --> 01:04:04,628
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

729
01:04:04,915 --> 01:04:06,930
What about second breakfast?

730
01:04:10,382 --> 01:04:13,260
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

731
01:04:13,547 --> 01:04:18,343
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

732
01:04:18,727 --> 01:04:22,563
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

733
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,468
Pippin!

734
01:04:45,485 --> 01:04:48,650
What do they eat
when they can't get Hobbit?

735
01:05:25,959 --> 01:05:27,974
Who is she?

736
01:05:28,741 --> 01:05:31,139
This woman you sing of.

737
01:05:34,591 --> 01:05:36,701
'Tis the lady of Lûthien.

738
01:05:37,085 --> 01:05:41,785
The Elf-maiden who gave her love
to Beren, a mortal.

739
01:05:43,703 --> 01:05:45,621
What happened to her?

740
01:05:47,827 --> 01:05:50,129
She died.

741
01:05:54,157 --> 01:05:56,267
Get some sleep, Frodo.

742
01:06:06,242 --> 01:06:09,982
<i>The power of Isengard
is at your command...</i>

743
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:14,394
<i>...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.</i>

744
01:06:17,847 --> 01:06:23,122
<i>Build me an army worthy of Mordor.</i>

745
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:32,809
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

746
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,207
We have work to do.

747
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:20,380
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

748
01:07:20,956 --> 01:07:22,682
Rip them all down.

749
01:07:49,057 --> 01:07:51,647
This was the great watchtower
of Amon SûI.

750
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,867
We shall rest here tonight.

751
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:10,349
These are for you.
Keep them close.

752
01:08:10,637 --> 01:08:12,939
I'm going to have a look around.

753
01:08:15,337 --> 01:08:17,063
Stay here.

754
01:08:19,653 --> 01:08:21,571
My tomato's burst.

755
01:08:21,859 --> 01:08:23,681
Could I have some bacon?

756
01:08:23,969 --> 01:08:25,695
Want a tomato, Sam?

757
01:08:26,175 --> 01:08:29,531
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

758
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:32,313
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

759
01:08:32,601 --> 01:08:36,245
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

760
01:08:44,589 --> 01:08:46,124
Go!

761
01:09:37,532 --> 01:09:38,874
Back, you devils!

762
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:00,110
Frodo!

763
01:11:04,714 --> 01:11:05,769
Oh, Sam.

764
01:11:41,352 --> 01:11:42,311
Strider!

765
01:11:44,996 --> 01:11:49,983
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

766
01:11:51,614 --> 01:11:56,122
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

767
01:12:00,821 --> 01:12:01,684
Hurry!

768
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:05,617
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

769
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,631
Hold on, Frodo.

770
01:12:08,206 --> 01:12:10,125
Gandalf!

771
01:14:41,854 --> 01:14:44,636
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

772
01:14:46,842 --> 01:14:49,431
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

773
01:14:52,308 --> 01:14:53,939
Is he going to die?

774
01:14:54,227 --> 01:14:58,734
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

775
01:15:03,818 --> 01:15:07,366
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

776
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,093
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

777
01:15:09,285 --> 01:15:10,244
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

778
01:15:10,531 --> 01:15:13,409
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

779
01:15:27,316 --> 01:15:31,152
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

780
01:15:55,226 --> 01:15:56,089
Frodo.

781
01:15:58,007 --> 01:16:00,884
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

782
01:15:58,007 --> 01:16:00,884
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

783
01:16:03,378 --> 01:16:05,008
Hear my voice...

784
01:16:03,378 --> 01:16:05,008
Hear my voice...

785
01:16:05,392 --> 01:16:07,310
Come back to the light.

786
01:16:05,392 --> 01:16:07,310
Come back to the light.

787
01:16:12,298 --> 01:16:14,024
Who is she?

788
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,326
Frodo.

789
01:16:16,709 --> 01:16:19,874
- She's an Elf.
- He's fading.

790
01:16:22,176 --> 01:16:24,190
He's not going to last.

791
01:16:24,478 --> 01:16:26,972
We must get him to my father.

792
01:16:27,835 --> 01:16:30,425
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

793
01:16:30,712 --> 01:16:36,371
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

794
01:16:37,618 --> 01:16:39,824
Stay with the Hobbits -
I'll send horses for you.

795
01:16:37,618 --> 01:16:39,824
Stay with the Hobbits -
I'll send horses for you.

796
01:16:40,207 --> 01:16:41,646
I'm the faster rider - I'll take him

797
01:16:40,207 --> 01:16:41,646
I'm the faster rider - I'll take him

798
01:16:42,605 --> 01:16:43,852
The Road is too dangerous.

799
01:16:42,605 --> 01:16:43,852
The Road is too dangerous.

800
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,195
What are they saying?

801
01:16:45,482 --> 01:16:47,305
If I can get across the river...

802
01:16:45,482 --> 01:16:47,305
If I can get across the river...

803
01:16:47,592 --> 01:16:49,990
...the power of my people
will protect him.

804
01:16:47,592 --> 01:16:49,990
...the power of my people
will protect him.

805
01:16:51,141 --> 01:16:52,580
I do not fear them.

806
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:03,322
Arwen...

807
01:17:03,609 --> 01:17:06,583
...ride hard. Don't look back.

808
01:17:11,474 --> 01:17:15,502
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

809
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:08,101
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

810
01:19:09,156 --> 01:19:11,458
If you want him, come and claim him.

811
01:20:03,249 --> 01:20:05,551
No. No!

812
01:20:08,812 --> 01:20:10,922
Frodo, no.

813
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:13,320
Frodo, don't give in.

814
01:20:13,607 --> 01:20:15,430
Not now.

815
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,281
<i>What grace is given me...</i>

816
01:20:28,953 --> 01:20:30,679
<i>...let it pass to him.</i>

817
01:20:30,967 --> 01:20:32,981
<i>Let him be spared.</i>

818
01:20:33,652 --> 01:20:35,475
<i>Save him.</i>

819
01:20:47,559 --> 01:20:52,259
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

820
01:20:52,834 --> 01:20:58,781
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

821
01:21:00,987 --> 01:21:04,440
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

822
01:21:06,262 --> 01:21:09,043
And you're lucky to be here too.

823
01:21:09,811 --> 01:21:13,551
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

824
01:21:13,839 --> 01:21:17,579
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

825
01:21:25,156 --> 01:21:27,362
What happened, Gandalf?

826
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:33,404
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

827
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,735
I was delayed.

828
01:21:40,694 --> 01:21:44,530
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

829
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:52,970
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

830
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,943
Embrace the power of the Ring...

831
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:59,012
...or embrace your own destruction!

832
01:22:01,314 --> 01:22:04,863
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

833
01:22:05,151 --> 01:22:08,891
Only one who can bend it to his will.

834
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:13,495
And he does not share power.

835
01:22:27,402 --> 01:22:30,471
So you have chosen death.

836
01:22:40,254 --> 01:22:43,707
Gandalf? What is it?

837
01:22:44,857 --> 01:22:46,488
Nothing, Frodo.

838
01:22:47,159 --> 01:22:48,982
Frodo!

839
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:52,626
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

840
01:22:52,914 --> 01:22:55,408
Sam has hardly left your side.

841
01:22:55,695 --> 01:22:57,709
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

842
01:22:58,189 --> 01:23:02,889
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

843
01:23:04,519 --> 01:23:07,780
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

844
01:23:54,105 --> 01:23:57,078
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

845
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:58,900
Bilbo.

846
01:24:03,696 --> 01:24:05,422
<i>"There and Back Again:</i>

847
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:08,299
<i>A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."</i>

848
01:24:11,368 --> 01:24:14,533
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

849
01:24:15,109 --> 01:24:18,562
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

850
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:21,151
...visit Lake-town...

851
01:24:21,535 --> 01:24:24,604
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

852
01:24:25,179 --> 01:24:29,687
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

853
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,210
I miss the Shire.

854
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:48,390
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

855
01:24:48,869 --> 01:24:52,130
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

856
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:58,460
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

857
01:25:03,543 --> 01:25:06,517
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

858
01:25:07,763 --> 01:25:09,873
My dear boy.

859
01:25:13,998 --> 01:25:17,546
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

860
01:25:18,505 --> 01:25:20,136
No harm in being prepared.

861
01:25:20,328 --> 01:25:22,725
- I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
- I do.

862
01:25:23,013 --> 01:25:25,603
- More than anything.
- I did.

863
01:25:25,986 --> 01:25:27,809
It's just...

864
01:25:28,576 --> 01:25:30,974
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

865
01:25:31,261 --> 01:25:34,618
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

866
01:25:35,002 --> 01:25:38,071
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

867
01:25:38,359 --> 01:25:39,893
Off home.

868
01:25:43,922 --> 01:25:45,744
You are right, Sam.

869
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:50,539
We did what we set out to do.

870
01:25:51,115 --> 01:25:53,513
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

871
01:25:57,541 --> 01:25:59,747
I am ready to go home.

872
01:26:00,514 --> 01:26:02,336
His strength returns.

873
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:07,899
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

874
01:26:08,762 --> 01:26:11,064
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

875
01:26:11,352 --> 01:26:14,709
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

876
01:26:15,188 --> 01:26:18,257
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

877
01:26:18,545 --> 01:26:23,532
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

878
01:26:23,916 --> 01:26:28,232
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

879
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:31,109
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

880
01:26:31,493 --> 01:26:34,466
Our list of allies grows thin.

881
01:26:35,233 --> 01:26:37,823
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

882
01:26:38,111 --> 01:26:41,468
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

883
01:26:41,851 --> 01:26:44,057
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

884
01:26:44,441 --> 01:26:48,661
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

885
01:26:49,045 --> 01:26:51,250
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

886
01:26:51,730 --> 01:26:55,470
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

887
01:26:55,854 --> 01:26:59,882
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

888
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:04,678
Gandalf...

889
01:27:06,021 --> 01:27:08,322
...the Ring cannot stay here.

890
01:27:27,217 --> 01:27:30,190
<i>This peril belongs
to all Middle-earth.</i>

891
01:27:30,574 --> 01:27:33,067
<i>They must decide now how to end it.</i>

892
01:27:34,122 --> 01:27:37,383
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

893
01:27:38,246 --> 01:27:41,507
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

894
01:27:41,891 --> 01:27:46,591
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

895
01:27:48,317 --> 01:27:50,907
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

896
01:27:51,386 --> 01:27:52,921
Men?

897
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,757
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

898
01:27:57,141 --> 01:28:01,169
The blood of Nûmenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

899
01:28:01,744 --> 01:28:04,909
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

900
01:28:05,293 --> 01:28:06,732
I was there, Gandalf.

901
01:28:07,403 --> 01:28:09,993
<i>I was there 3000 years ago...</i>

902
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:18,816
<i>...when Isildur took the Ring.</i>

903
01:28:19,104 --> 01:28:22,653
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

904
01:28:25,338 --> 01:28:27,736
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

905
01:28:29,366 --> 01:28:32,723
<i>I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...</i>

906
01:28:33,011 --> 01:28:36,272
<i>...where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.</i>

907
01:28:36,656 --> 01:28:38,957
Cast it into the fire!

908
01:28:44,041 --> 01:28:47,493
- Destroy it!
- No.

909
01:28:48,932 --> 01:28:50,946
Isildur!

910
01:28:51,522 --> 01:28:55,838
<i>It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.</i>

911
01:28:59,962 --> 01:29:03,894
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

912
01:29:04,949 --> 01:29:08,306
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

913
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:13,101
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

914
01:29:13,485 --> 01:29:16,554
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

915
01:29:18,376 --> 01:29:21,829
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

916
01:29:22,117 --> 01:29:24,035
He has chosen exile.

917
01:29:53,959 --> 01:29:55,781
You are no Elf.

918
01:29:56,069 --> 01:29:57,987
Men of the South are welcome here.

919
01:29:58,755 --> 01:30:01,920
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

920
01:30:03,454 --> 01:30:06,044
Then we are here on common purpose...

921
01:30:06,523 --> 01:30:07,770
...friend.

922
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:25,130
The shards of Narsil.

923
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:32,803
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

924
01:30:35,776 --> 01:30:37,790
It's still sharp.

925
01:30:46,422 --> 01:30:49,203
But no more than a broken heirloom.

926
01:31:15,003 --> 01:31:17,785
Why do you fear the past?

927
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:23,731
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

928
01:31:24,115 --> 01:31:27,280
You are not bound to his fate.

929
01:31:27,951 --> 01:31:31,596
The same blood flows in my veins.

930
01:31:34,761 --> 01:31:37,062
The same weakness.

931
01:31:39,748 --> 01:31:42,242
Your time will come.

932
01:31:42,529 --> 01:31:46,653
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

933
01:31:49,914 --> 01:31:52,120
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.

934
01:31:49,914 --> 01:31:52,120
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.

935
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:56,532
Not over you... not over me.

936
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:56,532
Not over you... not over me.

937
01:32:07,562 --> 01:32:10,535
Do you remember when we first met?

938
01:32:07,562 --> 01:32:10,535
Do you remember when we first met?

939
01:32:13,988 --> 01:32:18,112
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

940
01:32:13,988 --> 01:32:18,112
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

941
01:32:18,975 --> 01:32:21,181
Long years have passed.

942
01:32:18,975 --> 01:32:21,181
Long years have passed.

943
01:32:22,907 --> 01:32:25,977
You did not have the cares you carry now.

944
01:32:22,907 --> 01:32:25,977
You did not have the cares you carry now.

945
01:32:27,511 --> 01:32:29,429
Do you remember what I told you?

946
01:32:27,511 --> 01:32:29,429
Do you remember what I told you?

947
01:32:35,184 --> 01:32:37,678
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

948
01:32:39,788 --> 01:32:44,295
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

949
01:32:45,638 --> 01:32:47,365
And to that I hold.

950
01:32:47,748 --> 01:32:51,009
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

951
01:32:51,297 --> 01:32:54,846
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

952
01:33:03,573 --> 01:33:06,738
I choose a mortal life.

953
01:33:08,081 --> 01:33:11,918
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

954
01:33:15,178 --> 01:33:17,480
...like my heart.

955
01:33:32,826 --> 01:33:36,183
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

956
01:33:36,566 --> 01:33:40,211
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

957
01:33:40,882 --> 01:33:45,390
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

958
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:49,131
You will unite, or you will fall.

959
01:33:49,418 --> 01:33:53,351
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

960
01:33:55,365 --> 01:33:58,530
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

961
01:34:12,149 --> 01:34:13,780
So it is true.

962
01:34:30,564 --> 01:34:32,482
In a dream...

963
01:34:34,112 --> 01:34:37,086
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

964
01:34:37,565 --> 01:34:39,100
...but in the West
a pale light lingered.

965
01:34:39,963 --> 01:34:41,593
A voice was crying:

966
01:34:41,785 --> 01:34:44,471
"Your doom is near at hand.

967
01:34:45,622 --> 01:34:48,115
Isildur's Bane is found."

968
01:34:52,144 --> 01:34:53,774
Isildur's Bane.

969
01:34:54,445 --> 01:34:55,596
Boromir!

970
01:35:17,847 --> 01:35:21,300
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

971
01:35:21,684 --> 01:35:25,041
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...

972
01:35:25,424 --> 01:35:27,343
...for the Black Speech of Mordor...

973
01:35:27,726 --> 01:35:28,973
...may yet be heard...

974
01:35:29,261 --> 01:35:31,946
...in every corner of the West!

975
01:35:32,234 --> 01:35:34,728
The Ring is altogether evil.

976
01:35:35,111 --> 01:35:36,550
It is a gift.

977
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:39,044
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

978
01:35:39,715 --> 01:35:41,633
Why not use this Ring?

979
01:35:41,921 --> 01:35:44,510
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

980
01:35:44,798 --> 01:35:48,731
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

981
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:51,224
...are your lands kept safe.

982
01:35:53,046 --> 01:35:57,075
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

983
01:35:57,458 --> 01:36:00,911
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

984
01:36:01,582 --> 01:36:05,323
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

985
01:36:05,707 --> 01:36:08,968
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

986
01:36:09,447 --> 01:36:11,269
This is no mere Ranger.

987
01:36:12,228 --> 01:36:15,585
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

988
01:36:16,257 --> 01:36:18,942
You owe him your allegiance.

989
01:36:22,874 --> 01:36:24,697
Aragorn.

990
01:36:26,519 --> 01:36:29,109
This is Isildur's heir?

991
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:33,904
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

992
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:37,453
Sit down, Legolas.

993
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:37,453
Sit down, Legolas.

994
01:36:40,714 --> 01:36:43,303
Gondor has no king.

995
01:36:45,222 --> 01:36:46,756
Gondor needs no king.

996
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:56,539
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

997
01:36:57,690 --> 01:37:00,855
You have only one choice.

998
01:37:01,334 --> 01:37:03,444
The Ring must be destroyed.

999
01:37:08,528 --> 01:37:10,925
What are we waiting for?

1000
01:37:22,626 --> 01:37:25,408
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Glóin...

1001
01:37:25,696 --> 01:37:29,628
...by any craft that we here possess.

1002
01:37:30,299 --> 01:37:34,040
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

1003
01:37:34,519 --> 01:37:37,972
Only there can it be unmade.

1004
01:37:39,219 --> 01:37:41,521
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1005
01:37:41,904 --> 01:37:46,412
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

1006
01:37:48,522 --> 01:37:50,344
One of you...

1007
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:52,934
...must do this.

1008
01:37:55,811 --> 01:37:59,264
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1009
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:03,580
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

1010
01:38:04,539 --> 01:38:08,376
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

1011
01:38:08,663 --> 01:38:12,596
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

1012
01:38:13,459 --> 01:38:15,281
It is a barren wasteland...

1013
01:38:15,665 --> 01:38:18,926
...riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

1014
01:38:19,309 --> 01:38:22,858
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

1015
01:38:23,242 --> 01:38:27,174
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

1016
01:38:27,462 --> 01:38:31,586
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

1017
01:38:31,969 --> 01:38:34,271
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

1018
01:38:34,655 --> 01:38:38,875
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1019
01:38:39,259 --> 01:38:44,150
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

1020
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:48,562
Never trust an Elf!

1021
01:38:49,809 --> 01:38:55,180
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1022
01:38:55,659 --> 01:38:58,345
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1023
01:39:16,472 --> 01:39:18,486
I will take it.

1024
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:22,898
I will take it.

1025
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:31,338
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1026
01:39:39,298 --> 01:39:40,353
Though...

1027
01:39:43,518 --> 01:39:45,149
...I do not know the way.

1028
01:39:47,067 --> 01:39:50,999
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1029
01:39:51,479 --> 01:39:54,548
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1030
01:39:55,795 --> 01:39:58,576
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

1031
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:00,686
...I will.

1032
01:40:03,755 --> 01:40:05,865
You have my sword.

1033
01:40:07,688 --> 01:40:09,606
And you have my bow.

1034
01:40:10,277 --> 01:40:12,579
And my ax.

1035
01:40:19,389 --> 01:40:22,170
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

1036
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:27,541
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

1037
01:40:28,212 --> 01:40:30,418
...then Gondor will see it done.

1038
01:40:33,008 --> 01:40:37,420
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...

1039
01:40:37,803 --> 01:40:42,215
...even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

1040
01:40:42,983 --> 01:40:44,709
We're coming too!

1041
01:40:46,819 --> 01:40:49,313
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1042
01:40:49,696 --> 01:40:52,765
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1043
01:40:53,149 --> 01:40:54,300
...mission.

1044
01:40:54,684 --> 01:40:55,930
Quest.

1045
01:40:56,506 --> 01:40:57,465
Thing.

1046
01:40:59,287 --> 01:41:01,781
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1047
01:41:03,411 --> 01:41:05,138
Nine companions.

1048
01:41:06,864 --> 01:41:08,591
So be it.

1049
01:41:08,974 --> 01:41:11,756
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

1050
01:41:12,523 --> 01:41:14,249
Great!

1051
01:41:14,633 --> 01:41:16,743
Where are we going?

1052
01:41:50,983 --> 01:41:53,285
She wanted to protect her child...

1053
01:41:55,107 --> 01:41:58,560
she thought in Rivendell
you would be safe.

1054
01:42:00,862 --> 01:42:04,027
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

1055
01:42:04,602 --> 01:42:06,137
That you'd never escape your fate.

1056
01:42:06,808 --> 01:42:10,069
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

1057
01:42:10,644 --> 01:42:14,289
...but only you have the power
to wield it.

1058
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,646
I do not want that power.

1059
01:42:17,934 --> 01:42:20,427
I have never wanted it.

1060
01:42:21,866 --> 01:42:24,168
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1061
01:42:28,676 --> 01:42:30,786
My old sword! Sting.

1062
01:42:31,073 --> 01:42:32,128
Here, take it. Take it.

1063
01:42:37,403 --> 01:42:40,952
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1064
01:42:41,815 --> 01:42:45,652
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

1065
01:42:46,035 --> 01:42:50,255
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1066
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,941
Here's a pretty thing.

1067
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:54,571
Mithril.

1068
01:42:55,434 --> 01:42:59,463
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1069
01:42:59,846 --> 01:43:02,820
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1070
01:43:10,588 --> 01:43:12,506
My old ring.

1071
01:43:13,849 --> 01:43:17,398
I should very much like...

1072
01:43:17,781 --> 01:43:21,426
...to hold it again, one last time.

1073
01:43:38,306 --> 01:43:41,663
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1074
01:43:42,143 --> 01:43:45,883
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1075
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:53,172
I'm sorry for everything.

1076
01:44:07,559 --> 01:44:11,587
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1077
01:44:13,026 --> 01:44:15,423
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1078
01:44:15,711 --> 01:44:18,588
...nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1079
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:24,343
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1080
01:44:24,919 --> 01:44:28,467
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

1081
01:44:29,234 --> 01:44:31,632
...and all Free Folk go with you.

1082
01:44:34,605 --> 01:44:38,346
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1083
01:44:56,185 --> 01:44:58,487
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1084
01:44:59,158 --> 01:45:00,885
Left.

1085
01:46:17,229 --> 01:46:21,353
<i>We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.</i>

1086
01:46:21,737 --> 01:46:25,190
<i>If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.</i>

1087
01:46:25,478 --> 01:46:28,738
<i>From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.</i>

1088
01:46:29,122 --> 01:46:32,575
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1089
01:46:34,493 --> 01:46:35,452
Move your feet.

1090
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:36,891
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1091
01:46:37,179 --> 01:46:38,425
Faster!

1092
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:43,221
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1093
01:46:43,605 --> 01:46:46,194
...I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1094
01:46:46,770 --> 01:46:49,551
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

1095
01:46:50,318 --> 01:46:53,867
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1096
01:46:54,155 --> 01:46:59,142
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1097
01:47:08,157 --> 01:47:09,213
Sorry!

1098
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:11,418
Get him!

1099
01:47:12,857 --> 01:47:15,063
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1100
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:17,940
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1101
01:47:21,585 --> 01:47:23,119
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1102
01:47:23,599 --> 01:47:25,997
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1103
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:28,778
It's moving fast.

1104
01:47:29,162 --> 01:47:31,176
Against the wind.

1105
01:47:32,039 --> 01:47:33,957
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1106
01:47:34,149 --> 01:47:36,739
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1107
01:48:08,869 --> 01:48:10,403
Spies of Saruman.

1108
01:48:11,266 --> 01:48:14,240
The passage south is being watched.

1109
01:48:15,486 --> 01:48:18,555
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1110
01:48:30,832 --> 01:48:32,462
Frodo!

1111
01:48:50,685 --> 01:48:52,795
Boromir.

1112
01:48:53,083 --> 01:48:56,920
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1113
01:48:57,303 --> 01:49:00,180
...over so small a thing.

1114
01:49:03,345 --> 01:49:05,168
Such a little thing.

1115
01:49:05,456 --> 01:49:06,798
Boromir!

1116
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:09,867
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1117
01:49:19,458 --> 01:49:21,281
As you wish.

1118
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:23,966
I care not.

1119
01:49:58,014 --> 01:50:02,330
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

1120
01:50:02,714 --> 01:50:06,934
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1121
01:50:08,373 --> 01:50:11,058
<i>If the mountain defeats you...</i>

1122
01:50:11,346 --> 01:50:15,470
<i>...will you risk
a more dangerous road?</i>

1123
01:50:27,459 --> 01:50:30,144
There is a fell voice on the air.

1124
01:50:31,391 --> 01:50:32,734
It's Saruman!

1125
01:50:41,366 --> 01:50:45,586
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1126
01:50:45,969 --> 01:50:47,696
No!

1127
01:51:51,476 --> 01:51:53,202
We must get off the mountain!

1128
01:51:53,682 --> 01:51:57,710
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1129
01:51:58,094 --> 01:52:01,163
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

1130
01:52:01,451 --> 01:52:04,903
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1131
01:52:05,287 --> 01:52:07,876
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1132
01:52:09,795 --> 01:52:13,247
<i>Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.</i>

1133
01:52:14,015 --> 01:52:18,618
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1134
01:52:19,673 --> 01:52:24,085
<i>You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:</i>

1135
01:52:25,524 --> 01:52:28,689
Shadow and flame.

1136
01:52:32,142 --> 01:52:34,635
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1137
01:52:39,239 --> 01:52:41,157
We cannot stay here!

1138
01:52:41,445 --> 01:52:43,939
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

1139
01:52:44,322 --> 01:52:45,761
Frodo?

1140
01:52:48,830 --> 01:52:51,420
We will go through the mines.

1141
01:52:52,379 --> 01:52:54,105
So be it.

1142
01:53:00,531 --> 01:53:04,080
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1143
01:53:07,628 --> 01:53:09,643
How is your shoulder?

1144
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:12,904
- Better than it was.
- And the Ring?

1145
01:53:14,534 --> 01:53:16,836
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1146
01:53:17,411 --> 01:53:20,097
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1147
01:53:20,672 --> 01:53:24,221
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

1148
01:53:24,509 --> 01:53:26,906
And, I fear, from within.

1149
01:53:29,592 --> 01:53:33,332
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1150
01:53:33,716 --> 01:53:36,306
Trust your own strengths.

1151
01:53:36,689 --> 01:53:38,991
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1152
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:41,197
...for good or for evil.

1153
01:53:41,485 --> 01:53:43,595
Some are greater than I am.

1154
01:53:44,170 --> 01:53:47,527
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1155
01:53:48,966 --> 01:53:50,213
The walls...

1156
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:52,898
...of Moria.

1157
01:53:58,461 --> 01:54:01,146
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1158
01:54:01,530 --> 01:54:05,558
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1159
01:54:06,134 --> 01:54:08,340
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1160
01:54:16,108 --> 01:54:19,177
Well, let's see.

1161
01:54:19,561 --> 01:54:20,808
Ithildin.

1162
01:54:21,575 --> 01:54:24,644
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1163
01:54:38,263 --> 01:54:42,004
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

1164
01:54:42,771 --> 01:54:46,991
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1165
01:54:47,375 --> 01:54:51,691
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1166
01:55:14,709 --> 01:55:15,668
Nothing's happening.

1167
01:55:22,574 --> 01:55:26,410
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

1168
01:55:26,794 --> 01:55:29,288
...Men and Orcs.

1169
01:55:29,767 --> 01:55:30,918
What are you going to do, then?

1170
01:55:31,110 --> 01:55:33,124
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1171
01:55:33,508 --> 01:55:35,330
And if that does not shatter them...

1172
01:55:35,618 --> 01:55:38,015
...and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1173
01:55:38,303 --> 01:55:41,468
...I will try to find the opening words.

1174
01:55:54,032 --> 01:55:56,334
Mines are no place for a pony.

1175
01:55:56,718 --> 01:56:00,458
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

1176
01:56:01,705 --> 01:56:04,295
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1177
01:56:04,966 --> 01:56:08,227
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1178
01:56:14,941 --> 01:56:17,243
Do not disturb the water.

1179
01:56:17,530 --> 01:56:19,257
Oh, it's useless.

1180
01:56:31,533 --> 01:56:33,547
It's a riddle.

1181
01:56:36,233 --> 01:56:39,110
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1182
01:56:39,590 --> 01:56:42,275
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1183
01:56:43,714 --> 01:56:44,961
<i>Mellon.</i>

1184
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:06,828
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1185
01:57:07,404 --> 01:57:12,679
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1186
01:57:14,309 --> 01:57:17,186
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

1187
01:57:17,666 --> 01:57:19,872
And they call it a mine.

1188
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,982
A mine!

1189
01:57:23,037 --> 01:57:26,106
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1190
01:57:32,148 --> 01:57:33,587
No...

1191
01:57:34,834 --> 01:57:36,368
No!

1192
01:57:38,958 --> 01:57:40,397
Goblins.

1193
01:57:44,233 --> 01:57:48,165
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1194
01:57:49,316 --> 01:57:51,714
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1195
01:57:54,496 --> 01:57:56,606
- Frodo!
- Help!

1196
01:57:56,893 --> 01:57:58,332
Strider!

1197
01:57:58,716 --> 01:58:01,209
- Help!
- Get off him!

1198
01:58:01,497 --> 01:58:02,456
Aragorn!

1199
01:58:12,527 --> 01:58:13,486
Frodo!

1200
01:58:38,710 --> 01:58:39,669
Into the mines!

1201
01:58:39,861 --> 01:58:42,834
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1202
01:58:47,150 --> 01:58:48,781
Run!

1203
01:59:04,989 --> 01:59:08,250
We now have but one choice.

1204
01:59:08,730 --> 01:59:13,142
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1205
01:59:13,621 --> 01:59:15,348
Be on your guard.

1206
01:59:15,731 --> 01:59:18,800
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

1207
01:59:19,088 --> 01:59:22,349
...in the deep places of the world.

1208
01:59:30,214 --> 01:59:33,762
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1209
01:59:34,146 --> 01:59:37,695
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1210
02:00:21,717 --> 02:00:25,074
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

1211
02:00:25,458 --> 02:00:27,568
...or jewels...

1212
02:00:27,856 --> 02:00:30,637
...but mithril.

1213
02:00:48,476 --> 02:00:52,888
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1214
02:00:53,368 --> 02:00:56,916
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1215
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:59,026
I never told him...

1216
02:00:59,314 --> 02:01:03,918
...but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

1217
02:01:15,907 --> 02:01:17,537
Pippin.

1218
02:01:37,103 --> 02:01:39,788
I have no memory of this place.

1219
02:01:41,898 --> 02:01:43,145
- Are we lost?
- No.

1220
02:01:43,529 --> 02:01:45,831
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1221
02:01:46,118 --> 02:01:47,461
- Merry?
- What?

1222
02:01:47,653 --> 02:01:49,379
I'm hungry.

1223
02:02:00,409 --> 02:02:04,533
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1224
02:02:04,917 --> 02:02:08,657
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1225
02:02:09,041 --> 02:02:12,781
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

1226
02:02:13,645 --> 02:02:15,179
...or was set loose.

1227
02:02:15,755 --> 02:02:19,111
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1228
02:02:21,797 --> 02:02:24,291
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1229
02:02:24,674 --> 02:02:29,853
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1230
02:02:30,237 --> 02:02:34,649
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1231
02:02:35,032 --> 02:02:40,499
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

1232
02:02:41,746 --> 02:02:44,240
Before it drove him mad.

1233
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:47,309
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1234
02:02:47,693 --> 02:02:48,748
Pity?

1235
02:02:49,803 --> 02:02:52,488
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1236
02:02:53,447 --> 02:02:58,243
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1237
02:02:59,873 --> 02:03:02,079
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1238
02:03:04,573 --> 02:03:08,217
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1239
02:03:08,601 --> 02:03:11,286
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1240
02:03:11,862 --> 02:03:17,329
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1241
02:03:18,384 --> 02:03:20,973
...before this is over.

1242
02:03:22,604 --> 02:03:26,057
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1243
02:03:32,674 --> 02:03:35,648
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1244
02:03:37,182 --> 02:03:39,100
I wish none of this had happened.

1245
02:03:39,388 --> 02:03:43,992
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1246
02:03:44,951 --> 02:03:49,938
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1247
02:03:51,665 --> 02:03:55,309
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1248
02:03:55,885 --> 02:03:58,091
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1249
02:03:58,666 --> 02:04:02,598
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1250
02:04:03,078 --> 02:04:05,955
And that is an encouraging thought.

1251
02:04:10,751 --> 02:04:12,477
It's that way.

1252
02:04:12,765 --> 02:04:14,875
- He's remembered.
- No.

1253
02:04:15,163 --> 02:04:18,615
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1254
02:04:19,095 --> 02:04:23,795
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1255
02:04:38,277 --> 02:04:42,017
Let me risk a little more light.

1256
02:04:46,621 --> 02:04:48,539
Behold...

1257
02:04:49,019 --> 02:04:53,814
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1258
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:59,665
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1259
02:05:23,642 --> 02:05:25,177
Gimli!

1260
02:05:32,466 --> 02:05:33,905
No!

1261
02:05:36,494 --> 02:05:39,372
Oh, no.

1262
02:05:41,290 --> 02:05:42,441
No.

1263
02:05:49,442 --> 02:05:51,264
"Here lies Balin...

1264
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,662
...son of Fundin...

1265
02:05:54,046 --> 02:05:56,444
...Lord of Moria."

1266
02:05:57,595 --> 02:05:59,129
He is dead, then.

1267
02:06:00,856 --> 02:06:02,390
It's as I feared.

1268
02:06:19,942 --> 02:06:22,627
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1269
02:06:22,915 --> 02:06:27,231
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1270
02:06:28,478 --> 02:06:30,875
We have barred the gates...

1271
02:06:31,643 --> 02:06:33,849
...but cannot hold them for long.

1272
02:06:34,136 --> 02:06:36,726
The ground shakes.

1273
02:06:37,205 --> 02:06:38,644
Drums...

1274
02:06:39,124 --> 02:06:42,193
...drums in the deep.

1275
02:06:45,837 --> 02:06:47,660
We cannot get out.

1276
02:06:49,674 --> 02:06:53,222
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1277
02:06:54,949 --> 02:06:57,347
We cannot get out.

1278
02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:02,046
They are coming."

1279
02:07:43,479 --> 02:07:45,110
Fool of a Took!

1280
02:07:45,493 --> 02:07:48,946
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1281
02:08:14,171 --> 02:08:15,705
Frodo!

1282
02:08:18,007 --> 02:08:19,254
Orcs.

1283
02:08:26,159 --> 02:08:27,982
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1284
02:08:34,887 --> 02:08:36,613
They have a cave-troll.

1285
02:08:51,863 --> 02:08:52,918
Let them come!

1286
02:08:53,398 --> 02:08:56,659
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1287
02:11:10,261 --> 02:11:12,851
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1288
02:11:17,455 --> 02:11:19,085
Frodo!

1289
02:11:51,311 --> 02:11:53,037
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1290
02:11:54,092 --> 02:11:55,819
Frodo!

1291
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:40,896
Frodo!

1292
02:13:38,826 --> 02:13:39,977
Oh, no.

1293
02:13:48,033 --> 02:13:49,760
He's alive.

1294
02:13:52,254 --> 02:13:54,939
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1295
02:13:55,323 --> 02:13:57,337
You should be dead.

1296
02:13:57,624 --> 02:13:59,926
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1297
02:14:00,214 --> 02:14:04,626
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1298
02:14:10,381 --> 02:14:11,340
Mithril.

1299
02:14:14,121 --> 02:14:16,519
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1300
02:14:22,369 --> 02:14:24,096
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1301
02:14:38,674 --> 02:14:40,113
This way!

1302
02:15:47,633 --> 02:15:50,415
What is this new devilry?

1303
02:16:05,952 --> 02:16:08,542
A Balrog.

1304
02:16:08,925 --> 02:16:11,803
A demon of the ancient world.

1305
02:16:14,105 --> 02:16:16,310
This foe is beyond any of you.

1306
02:16:17,557 --> 02:16:18,996
Run!

1307
02:16:26,093 --> 02:16:27,532
Quickly!

1308
02:16:43,453 --> 02:16:44,604
Gandalf.

1309
02:16:45,275 --> 02:16:46,714
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1310
02:16:48,153 --> 02:16:50,454
The bridge is near.

1311
02:16:52,564 --> 02:16:56,305
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1312
02:17:24,407 --> 02:17:25,941
Gandalf!

1313
02:17:43,685 --> 02:17:44,740
Merry! Pippin!

1314
02:17:55,481 --> 02:17:56,920
Sam!

1315
02:17:59,510 --> 02:18:02,483
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1316
02:18:05,552 --> 02:18:06,895
Not the beard!

1317
02:18:19,651 --> 02:18:21,377
Steady.

1318
02:18:23,487 --> 02:18:25,022
Hold on!

1319
02:18:45,259 --> 02:18:46,314
Hang on!

1320
02:18:56,768 --> 02:18:58,303
Lean forward!

1321
02:19:01,276 --> 02:19:02,235
Steady.

1322
02:19:03,578 --> 02:19:04,633
Come on!

1323
02:19:04,824 --> 02:19:06,167
Now!

1324
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:24,486
Over the bridge!

1325
02:19:24,774 --> 02:19:26,212
Fly!

1326
02:20:08,988 --> 02:20:10,811
You cannot pass!

1327
02:20:11,098 --> 02:20:12,537
Gandalf!

1328
02:20:16,757 --> 02:20:21,265
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1329
02:20:22,416 --> 02:20:25,868
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

1330
02:20:35,651 --> 02:20:37,378
Go back to the Shadow.

1331
02:20:45,051 --> 02:20:49,079
You shall not pass!

1332
02:21:15,358 --> 02:21:18,907
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1333
02:21:26,388 --> 02:21:28,594
Fly, you fools!

1334
02:21:32,718 --> 02:21:34,636
No!

1335
02:21:40,582 --> 02:21:42,597
Aragorn!

1336
02:22:37,745 --> 02:22:40,239
Legolas, get them up.

1337
02:22:44,267 --> 02:22:45,993
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1338
02:22:46,281 --> 02:22:49,542
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1339
02:22:50,021 --> 02:22:52,995
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1340
02:22:54,050 --> 02:22:57,119
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1341
02:22:58,653 --> 02:23:00,667
On your feet, Sam.

1342
02:23:01,147 --> 02:23:02,490
Frodo?

1343
02:23:04,504 --> 02:23:06,038
Frodo!

1344
02:23:56,487 --> 02:23:58,789
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1345
02:23:59,556 --> 02:24:03,393
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1346
02:24:03,776 --> 02:24:06,078
An Elf-witch...

1347
02:24:06,845 --> 02:24:09,435
...of terrible power.

1348
02:24:10,010 --> 02:24:12,024
All who look upon her...

1349
02:24:12,408 --> 02:24:14,039
...fall under her spell.

1350
02:24:14,326 --> 02:24:15,477
<i>Frodo!</i>

1351
02:24:17,683 --> 02:24:19,505
And are never seen again.

1352
02:24:19,793 --> 02:24:23,917
<i>Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.</i>

1353
02:24:24,397 --> 02:24:27,754
<i>You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.</i>

1354
02:24:28,137 --> 02:24:29,768
Mr. Frodo?

1355
02:24:34,947 --> 02:24:40,030
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1356
02:24:40,414 --> 02:24:44,634
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1357
02:24:52,211 --> 02:24:56,335
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1358
02:25:01,514 --> 02:25:03,336
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.

1359
02:25:04,295 --> 02:25:06,693
Our Fellowship stands in your debt.

1360
02:25:09,475 --> 02:25:11,009
Aragorn of the Dunedain...

1361
02:25:11,776 --> 02:25:13,023
you are known to us.

1362
02:25:13,982 --> 02:25:15,996
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

1363
02:25:16,284 --> 02:25:18,011
Speak words we can all understand!

1364
02:25:18,298 --> 02:25:22,518
We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1365
02:25:22,998 --> 02:25:25,300
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

1366
02:25:32,013 --> 02:25:33,740
That was not so courteous.

1367
02:25:40,070 --> 02:25:43,810
You bring great evil with you.

1368
02:25:45,729 --> 02:25:47,743
You can go no further.

1369
02:26:23,709 --> 02:26:26,107
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1370
02:26:27,258 --> 02:26:28,984
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1371
02:26:30,615 --> 02:26:33,588
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1372
02:26:34,547 --> 02:26:37,328
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1373
02:26:40,301 --> 02:26:42,124
You will follow me.

1374
02:26:53,441 --> 02:26:55,167
Caras Galadhon.

1375
02:26:55,935 --> 02:26:58,524
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1376
02:26:59,004 --> 02:27:04,183
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1377
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:23,021
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1378
02:28:23,884 --> 02:28:28,584
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1379
02:28:30,502 --> 02:28:34,530
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1380
02:28:35,010 --> 02:28:36,640
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1381
02:28:36,832 --> 02:28:39,709
For I much desire to speak with him.

1382
02:28:40,093 --> 02:28:42,587
I can no longer see him from afar.

1383
02:28:43,546 --> 02:28:48,245
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

1384
02:28:48,725 --> 02:28:50,931
He has fallen into Shadow.

1385
02:28:55,535 --> 02:28:59,659
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1386
02:29:01,577 --> 02:29:04,934
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1387
02:29:05,797 --> 02:29:08,866
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1388
02:29:11,072 --> 02:29:14,045
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1389
02:29:14,717 --> 02:29:17,690
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1390
02:29:22,485 --> 02:29:26,418
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

1391
02:29:26,801 --> 02:29:29,007
...Gimli, son of Glóin.

1392
02:29:29,966 --> 02:29:33,227
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1393
02:29:34,762 --> 02:29:37,160
...and in all lands...

1394
02:29:37,543 --> 02:29:40,708
...Iove is now mingled with grief.

1395
02:29:52,985 --> 02:29:55,478
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1396
02:29:56,150 --> 02:29:58,835
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1397
02:30:01,904 --> 02:30:04,878
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1398
02:30:05,165 --> 02:30:07,947
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1399
02:30:08,810 --> 02:30:11,400
...to the ruin of all.

1400
02:30:15,715 --> 02:30:20,991
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1401
02:30:22,717 --> 02:30:27,129
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1402
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:31,157
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1403
02:30:33,459 --> 02:30:35,377
Tonight, you will sleep...

1404
02:30:35,761 --> 02:30:38,926
<i>Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...</i>

1405
02:30:40,460 --> 02:30:42,091
<i>...one who has seen the Eye!</i>

1406
02:30:56,190 --> 02:30:58,587
A lament for Gandalf.

1407
02:31:05,685 --> 02:31:07,027
What do they say about him?

1408
02:31:07,315 --> 02:31:09,713
I have not the heart to tell you.

1409
02:31:12,686 --> 02:31:14,700
For me, the grief is still too near.

1410
02:31:17,673 --> 02:31:20,167
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1411
02:31:20,551 --> 02:31:23,332
There should be a verse about them.

1412
02:31:26,881 --> 02:31:28,703
<i>The finest rockets ever seen</i>

1413
02:31:29,854 --> 02:31:32,444
<i>They burst in stars of blue and green</i>

1414
02:31:33,403 --> 02:31:38,198
<i>Or after thunder, silver showers</i>

1415
02:31:39,157 --> 02:31:41,651
<i>Came falling like a rain of flowers</i>

1416
02:31:41,939 --> 02:31:45,487
Oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1417
02:31:55,941 --> 02:31:58,435
Take some rest.

1418
02:31:58,723 --> 02:32:01,121
These borders are well-protected.

1419
02:32:01,408 --> 02:32:03,710
I will find no rest here.

1420
02:32:06,683 --> 02:32:09,369
I heard her voice inside my head.

1421
02:32:09,848 --> 02:32:13,109
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1422
02:32:13,589 --> 02:32:18,576
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

1423
02:32:20,015 --> 02:32:22,604
But I cannot see it.

1424
02:32:24,043 --> 02:32:26,345
It is long since we had any hope.

1425
02:32:36,224 --> 02:32:38,142
My father is a noble man.

1426
02:32:39,005 --> 02:32:41,019
But his rule is failing...

1427
02:32:44,184 --> 02:32:46,582
...and our people lose faith.

1428
02:32:48,021 --> 02:32:51,186
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1429
02:32:51,569 --> 02:32:54,830
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1430
02:32:57,708 --> 02:33:00,393
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1431
02:33:01,160 --> 02:33:02,983
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1432
02:33:03,366 --> 02:33:06,819
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1433
02:33:07,682 --> 02:33:10,847
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1434
02:33:13,725 --> 02:33:15,547
Have you ever been called home...

1435
02:33:15,835 --> 02:33:19,383
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1436
02:33:20,151 --> 02:33:23,124
I have seen the White City...

1437
02:33:23,603 --> 02:33:24,946
...Iong ago.

1438
02:33:25,905 --> 02:33:30,509
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1439
02:33:31,660 --> 02:33:34,345
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1440
02:33:34,921 --> 02:33:37,894
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1441
02:34:42,537 --> 02:34:44,839
Will you look into the mirror?

1442
02:34:45,127 --> 02:34:46,566
What will I see?

1443
02:34:49,443 --> 02:34:51,553
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1444
02:34:52,512 --> 02:34:54,238
For the mirror...

1445
02:34:54,526 --> 02:34:56,828
...shows many things.

1446
02:34:59,801 --> 02:35:02,007
Things that were...

1447
02:35:02,295 --> 02:35:04,693
...things that are...

1448
02:35:05,556 --> 02:35:07,378
...and some things...

1449
02:35:10,831 --> 02:35:13,900
...that have not yet come to pass.

1450
02:36:33,218 --> 02:36:35,807
I know what it is you saw.

1451
02:36:38,301 --> 02:36:40,603
For it is also in my mind.

1452
02:36:42,425 --> 02:36:46,165
<i>It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.</i>

1453
02:36:48,563 --> 02:36:52,975
<i>The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.</i>

1454
02:36:53,934 --> 02:36:56,907
<i>He will try to take the Ring.</i>

1455
02:36:57,195 --> 02:36:59,017
<i>You know of whom I speak.</i>

1456
02:37:00,072 --> 02:37:04,388
<i>One by one, it will destroy them all.</i>

1457
02:37:06,019 --> 02:37:08,321
<i>If you ask it of me...</i>

1458
02:37:08,704 --> 02:37:11,582
<i>...I will give you the One Ring.</i>

1459
02:37:12,732 --> 02:37:14,747
You offer it to me freely.

1460
02:37:19,158 --> 02:37:22,707
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1461
02:37:29,133 --> 02:37:32,106
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1462
02:37:32,682 --> 02:37:36,135
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1463
02:37:36,902 --> 02:37:39,683
Treacherous as the sea!

1464
02:37:40,259 --> 02:37:44,766
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1465
02:37:45,534 --> 02:37:47,644
All shall love me...

1466
02:37:47,931 --> 02:37:50,521
...and despair.

1467
02:38:04,236 --> 02:38:08,169
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1468
02:38:08,552 --> 02:38:10,758
...and go into the West...

1469
02:38:11,142 --> 02:38:15,266
...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1470
02:38:18,910 --> 02:38:22,651
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1471
02:38:23,706 --> 02:38:25,145
...is to be alone.

1472
02:38:28,406 --> 02:38:30,899
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

1473
02:38:31,187 --> 02:38:32,626
And I am its keeper.

1474
02:38:35,791 --> 02:38:39,147
This task was appointed to you.

1475
02:38:40,298 --> 02:38:42,888
And if you do not find a way...

1476
02:38:44,231 --> 02:38:46,053
...no one will.

1477
02:38:46,533 --> 02:38:49,410
Then I know what I must do.

1478
02:38:50,177 --> 02:38:51,232
It's just...

1479
02:38:54,493 --> 02:38:56,507
...I'm afraid to do it.

1480
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:04,660
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1481
02:39:10,031 --> 02:39:15,306
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1482
02:39:16,265 --> 02:39:19,238
They were Elves once.

1483
02:39:20,581 --> 02:39:23,650
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1484
02:39:24,033 --> 02:39:26,911
...tortured and mutilated.

1485
02:39:27,294 --> 02:39:32,186
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1486
02:39:32,665 --> 02:39:34,296
And now...

1487
02:39:35,926 --> 02:39:37,557
...perfected.

1488
02:39:38,324 --> 02:39:41,297
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1489
02:39:43,311 --> 02:39:45,325
...whom do you serve?

1490
02:39:45,709 --> 02:39:47,915
Saruman!

1491
02:40:08,056 --> 02:40:11,125
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1492
02:40:11,509 --> 02:40:14,194
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1493
02:40:14,482 --> 02:40:17,263
You will taste Man-flesh!

1494
02:40:22,443 --> 02:40:25,799
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1495
02:40:26,183 --> 02:40:30,115
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1496
02:40:31,938 --> 02:40:33,089
Kill the others.

1497
02:40:51,599 --> 02:40:56,683
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

1498
02:40:57,929 --> 02:41:01,382
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1499
02:41:08,479 --> 02:41:10,014
Lembas.

1500
02:41:10,302 --> 02:41:11,740
Elvish waybread.

1501
02:41:14,138 --> 02:41:16,920
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1502
02:41:23,250 --> 02:41:24,976
How many did you eat?

1503
02:41:25,360 --> 02:41:26,798
Four.

1504
02:41:32,457 --> 02:41:34,855
<i>Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.</i>

1505
02:41:35,142 --> 02:41:38,883
<i>Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.</i>

1506
02:41:39,267 --> 02:41:41,568
<i>Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.</i>

1507
02:41:41,856 --> 02:41:45,309
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

1508
02:41:45,788 --> 02:41:50,392
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1509
02:41:58,928 --> 02:42:01,230
You are being tracked.

1510
02:42:02,765 --> 02:42:06,985
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.

1511
02:42:23,769 --> 02:42:28,181
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1512
02:42:28,564 --> 02:42:31,729
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1513
02:42:37,004 --> 02:42:39,210
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1514
02:42:39,594 --> 02:42:43,239
They have already seen service in war.

1515
02:42:43,526 --> 02:42:45,636
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1516
02:42:45,924 --> 02:42:48,897
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

1517
02:42:50,911 --> 02:42:52,638
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

1518
02:42:52,926 --> 02:42:55,227
...EIven rope made of hithlain.

1519
02:42:55,515 --> 02:42:57,529
Thank you, my lady.

1520
02:42:59,351 --> 02:43:02,421
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1521
02:43:08,751 --> 02:43:11,532
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

1522
02:43:11,820 --> 02:43:13,738
Nothing.

1523
02:43:14,409 --> 02:43:17,479
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1524
02:43:18,246 --> 02:43:23,041
...for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1525
02:43:30,043 --> 02:43:31,385
Actually...

1526
02:43:31,769 --> 02:43:33,208
There was one thing.

1527
02:43:34,071 --> 02:43:36,469
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

1528
02:43:36,756 --> 02:43:39,346
<i>Stupid to ask.</i>

1529
02:43:41,936 --> 02:43:43,758
<i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

1530
02:43:44,142 --> 02:43:47,402
...than the gift you already bear.

1531
02:43:48,745 --> 02:43:49,704
For her love,

1532
02:43:50,951 --> 02:43:55,938
I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar
will diminish.

1533
02:43:56,802 --> 02:43:59,871
I would have her leave these shores,

1534
02:44:01,501 --> 02:44:04,091
and be with her people.

1535
02:44:06,201 --> 02:44:11,380
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

1536
02:44:11,955 --> 02:44:14,737
That choice is yet before her.

1537
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:18,190
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1538
02:44:18,765 --> 02:44:24,040
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1539
02:44:24,424 --> 02:44:28,452
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1540
02:44:35,549 --> 02:44:36,796
Farewell.

1541
02:44:40,537 --> 02:44:43,606
There is much you have yet to do.

1542
02:44:50,032 --> 02:44:51,183
We shall not meet again...

1543
02:44:51,470 --> 02:44:52,717
Elessar.

1544
02:44:55,019 --> 02:44:57,896
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

1545
02:44:58,376 --> 02:45:01,445
I give you the light of Eärendil...

1546
02:45:02,308 --> 02:45:04,418
...our most beloved star.

1547
02:45:13,338 --> 02:45:17,366
<i>May it be a light for you
in dark places...</i>

1548
02:45:17,750 --> 02:45:21,490
<i>...when all other lights go out.</i>

1549
02:45:30,314 --> 02:45:33,191
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1550
02:45:33,959 --> 02:45:37,891
...having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1551
02:45:38,754 --> 02:45:41,823
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1552
02:45:42,207 --> 02:45:43,933
What was her gift?

1553
02:45:44,221 --> 02:45:48,729
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1554
02:45:49,688 --> 02:45:52,277
She gave me three.

1555
02:47:30,489 --> 02:47:33,558
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1556
02:47:37,299 --> 02:47:40,176
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1557
02:47:40,560 --> 02:47:43,533
But he's too clever a waterman.

1558
02:47:44,396 --> 02:47:47,369
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1559
02:47:47,753 --> 02:47:49,767
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1560
02:47:50,055 --> 02:47:51,973
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1561
02:47:52,165 --> 02:47:54,946
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1562
02:47:55,330 --> 02:47:58,207
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1563
02:47:59,166 --> 02:48:01,852
- Mr. Frodo...
- I'm all right.

1564
02:48:02,331 --> 02:48:03,386
But you're not.

1565
02:48:03,674 --> 02:48:05,880
I'm here to help you.

1566
02:48:06,264 --> 02:48:07,798
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1567
02:48:13,649 --> 02:48:16,142
You can't help me, Sam.

1568
02:48:18,348 --> 02:48:19,979
Not this time.

1569
02:48:22,664 --> 02:48:24,678
Get some sleep.

1570
02:48:30,721 --> 02:48:32,735
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1571
02:48:33,406 --> 02:48:35,900
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1572
02:48:36,667 --> 02:48:38,681
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

1573
02:48:39,065 --> 02:48:41,655
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

1574
02:48:42,326 --> 02:48:44,148
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

1575
02:48:45,971 --> 02:48:48,464
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1576
02:48:48,944 --> 02:48:51,629
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1577
02:48:51,917 --> 02:48:54,986
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1578
02:48:55,274 --> 02:48:57,288
But you will not see that.

1579
02:48:57,672 --> 02:48:59,014
You are afraid!

1580
02:48:59,302 --> 02:49:01,700
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1581
02:49:02,083 --> 02:49:05,248
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1582
02:49:07,742 --> 02:49:11,770
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1583
02:49:23,280 --> 02:49:24,430
Frodo.

1584
02:49:26,253 --> 02:49:27,691
The Argonath.

1585
02:49:31,144 --> 02:49:34,501
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1586
02:49:35,364 --> 02:49:37,091
My kin.

1587
02:50:52,955 --> 02:50:54,970
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1588
02:50:55,257 --> 02:50:57,655
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1589
02:50:57,943 --> 02:51:01,108
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1590
02:51:01,683 --> 02:51:05,136
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1591
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:08,493
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1592
02:51:08,781 --> 02:51:11,658
And after that, it gets even better.

1593
02:51:12,233 --> 02:51:16,645
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1594
02:51:17,125 --> 02:51:18,372
That is our road.

1595
02:51:19,906 --> 02:51:22,783
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1596
02:51:23,071 --> 02:51:24,702
Recover my...

1597
02:51:27,675 --> 02:51:29,497
- We should leave now.
- No.

1598
02:51:29,785 --> 02:51:33,813
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1599
02:51:34,197 --> 02:51:37,362
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1600
02:51:37,650 --> 02:51:41,390
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1601
02:51:42,061 --> 02:51:45,898
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1602
02:51:48,008 --> 02:51:52,516
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1603
02:51:53,187 --> 02:51:54,722
Where's Frodo?

1604
02:52:19,466 --> 02:52:21,193
None of us should wander alone.

1605
02:52:22,535 --> 02:52:24,454
You, least of all.

1606
02:52:24,837 --> 02:52:27,043
So much depends on you.

1607
02:52:28,194 --> 02:52:30,016
Frodo?

1608
02:52:36,922 --> 02:52:39,320
I know why you seek solitude.

1609
02:52:40,087 --> 02:52:43,156
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1610
02:52:44,115 --> 02:52:46,897
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1611
02:52:48,527 --> 02:52:51,021
There are other ways, Frodo.

1612
02:52:51,404 --> 02:52:54,857
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1613
02:52:55,241 --> 02:52:58,694
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1614
02:52:59,077 --> 02:53:01,859
Warning? Against what?

1615
02:53:02,242 --> 02:53:04,160
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1616
02:53:04,448 --> 02:53:07,805
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1617
02:53:08,189 --> 02:53:11,641
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1618
02:53:13,464 --> 02:53:16,533
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1619
02:53:18,163 --> 02:53:20,082
- Lf you would but lend me the Ring.
- No.

1620
02:53:21,328 --> 02:53:24,685
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1621
02:53:26,603 --> 02:53:29,673
What chance do you think you have?

1622
02:53:29,960 --> 02:53:34,276
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1623
02:53:34,660 --> 02:53:38,017
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1624
02:53:40,223 --> 02:53:42,141
You fool!

1625
02:53:42,429 --> 02:53:46,073
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1626
02:53:46,457 --> 02:53:49,046
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1627
02:53:49,334 --> 02:53:50,485
- Give it to me!
- No!

1628
02:53:50,773 --> 02:53:52,403
- Give it to me!
- No.

1629
02:53:59,884 --> 02:54:01,706
I see your mind.

1630
02:54:01,994 --> 02:54:04,680
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1631
02:54:05,063 --> 02:54:06,694
You will betray us!

1632
02:54:07,077 --> 02:54:09,955
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1633
02:54:10,434 --> 02:54:13,791
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1634
02:54:20,793 --> 02:54:22,231
Frodo?

1635
02:54:26,355 --> 02:54:27,794
Frodo.

1636
02:54:31,630 --> 02:54:33,453
What have I done?

1637
02:54:33,836 --> 02:54:35,371
Please, Frodo.

1638
02:54:35,659 --> 02:54:38,152
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1639
02:55:24,861 --> 02:55:26,107
Frodo?

1640
02:55:27,354 --> 02:55:30,231
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?

1641
02:55:30,519 --> 02:55:32,150
Stay away!

1642
02:55:32,629 --> 02:55:34,068
Frodo!

1643
02:55:36,370 --> 02:55:39,822
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1644
02:55:49,222 --> 02:55:51,524
Would you destroy it?

1645
02:55:56,415 --> 02:55:58,237
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1646
02:56:01,690 --> 02:56:03,800
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1647
02:56:05,526 --> 02:56:07,253
<i>Elessar.</i>

1648
02:56:14,638 --> 02:56:17,803
I would have gone with you to the end.

1649
02:56:18,570 --> 02:56:21,160
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1650
02:56:24,421 --> 02:56:25,476
I know.

1651
02:56:27,969 --> 02:56:32,957
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1652
02:56:36,889 --> 02:56:38,424
Go, Frodo!

1653
02:56:41,301 --> 02:56:42,644
Run.

1654
02:56:43,027 --> 02:56:44,466
Run!

1655
02:57:08,156 --> 02:57:09,690
Mr. Frodo!

1656
02:57:18,610 --> 02:57:20,240
Find the halfling!

1657
02:57:21,967 --> 02:57:24,269
Find the halfling!

1658
02:57:27,625 --> 02:57:29,160
Elendil!

1659
02:57:35,490 --> 02:57:36,833
Aragorn, go!

1660
02:57:57,837 --> 02:57:58,988
Frodo!

1661
02:57:59,659 --> 02:58:01,098
Hide here. Quick!

1662
02:58:01,865 --> 02:58:03,112
Come on!

1663
02:58:05,510 --> 02:58:07,428
What's he doing?

1664
02:58:11,552 --> 02:58:13,375
He's leaving.

1665
02:58:18,074 --> 02:58:20,760
- No!
- Pippin!

1666
02:58:25,651 --> 02:58:27,761
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1667
02:58:28,337 --> 02:58:31,214
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1668
02:58:31,693 --> 02:58:33,132
- Over here!
- This way!

1669
02:58:43,586 --> 02:58:45,792
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1670
02:59:39,022 --> 02:59:41,804
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1671
03:00:23,237 --> 03:00:24,292
Run!

1672
03:03:47,238 --> 03:03:48,772
No.

1673
03:03:52,608 --> 03:03:55,390
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1674
03:03:55,678 --> 03:03:57,596
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1675
03:03:59,514 --> 03:04:00,857
I let Frodo go.

1676
03:04:01,528 --> 03:04:03,926
Then you did what I could not.

1677
03:04:04,981 --> 03:04:07,954
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1678
03:04:08,721 --> 03:04:12,558
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1679
03:04:12,941 --> 03:04:14,956
I did not see it.

1680
03:04:15,435 --> 03:04:18,312
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1681
03:04:18,792 --> 03:04:21,190
You fought bravely.

1682
03:04:21,573 --> 03:04:23,971
You have kept your honor.

1683
03:04:24,642 --> 03:04:26,369
Leave it.

1684
03:04:26,752 --> 03:04:28,671
It is over.

1685
03:04:30,013 --> 03:04:34,809
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1686
03:04:35,384 --> 03:04:38,166
...and my city to ruin.

1687
03:04:42,194 --> 03:04:44,688
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1688
03:04:44,975 --> 03:04:48,620
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1689
03:04:49,771 --> 03:04:52,073
...nor our people fail.

1690
03:04:53,128 --> 03:04:54,375
Our people.

1691
03:04:58,115 --> 03:05:00,033
Our people.

1692
03:05:20,942 --> 03:05:23,723
I would have followed you, my brother.

1693
03:05:25,354 --> 03:05:27,176
My captain.

1694
03:05:29,765 --> 03:05:31,492
My king.

1695
03:05:50,482 --> 03:05:52,496
Be at peace...

1696
03:05:52,976 --> 03:05:54,798
...son of Gondor.

1697
03:06:10,719 --> 03:06:13,788
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

1698
03:06:14,364 --> 03:06:17,145
But he will not return.

1699
03:06:39,588 --> 03:06:41,410
Frodo!

1700
03:07:00,113 --> 03:07:03,182
<i>I wish the Ring had never come to me.</i>

1701
03:07:04,429 --> 03:07:07,114
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

1702
03:07:10,183 --> 03:07:12,677
<i>So do all who live
to see such times...</i>

1703
03:07:12,965 --> 03:07:16,130
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

1704
03:07:16,609 --> 03:07:19,007
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

1705
03:07:19,295 --> 03:07:23,611
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1706
03:07:51,425 --> 03:07:53,343
Frodo, no!

1707
03:07:53,918 --> 03:07:55,069
Frodo!

1708
03:07:55,932 --> 03:07:58,426
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1709
03:08:01,975 --> 03:08:03,701
Go back, Sam!

1710
03:08:04,277 --> 03:08:07,537
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1711
03:08:07,921 --> 03:08:10,511
And I'm coming with you!

1712
03:08:11,182 --> 03:08:13,388
You can't swim!

1713
03:08:17,033 --> 03:08:18,567
Sam!

1714
03:08:24,034 --> 03:08:25,281
Sam!

1715
03:09:04,508 --> 03:09:07,002
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1716
03:09:07,577 --> 03:09:11,509
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1717
03:09:12,756 --> 03:09:15,154
And I don't mean to.

1718
03:09:15,538 --> 03:09:17,456
I don't mean to.

1719
03:09:19,182 --> 03:09:20,909
Sam.

1720
03:09:35,487 --> 03:09:37,022
Come on.

1721
03:10:04,452 --> 03:10:08,576
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1722
03:10:23,058 --> 03:10:27,662
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1723
03:10:31,115 --> 03:10:35,527
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1724
03:10:47,132 --> 03:10:50,009
Not if we hold true to each other.

1725
03:10:51,544 --> 03:10:55,572
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1726
03:10:56,723 --> 03:11:01,518
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1727
03:11:03,053 --> 03:11:04,875
We travel light.

1728
03:11:05,163 --> 03:11:06,889
Let us hunt some Orc.

1729
03:11:09,863 --> 03:11:11,685
Yes!

1730
03:11:30,004 --> 03:11:31,250
Mordor.

1731
03:11:32,018 --> 03:11:35,087
I hope the others find a safer road.

1732
03:11:36,142 --> 03:11:38,444
Strider will look after them.

1733
03:11:39,403 --> 03:11:42,568
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1734
03:11:43,047 --> 03:11:45,253
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1735
03:11:45,541 --> 03:11:46,980
We may.

1736
03:11:48,994 --> 03:11:49,953
Sam...

1737
03:11:53,502 --> 03:11:55,899
...I'm glad you are with me.
