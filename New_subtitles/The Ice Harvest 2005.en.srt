1
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,333
People always say...

2
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,708
there's no such thing
as the perfect crime.

3
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,208
But I don't agree with that.

4
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,000
If you plan things
carefully enough...

5
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,500
if you think through
every last detail...

6
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,750
if you have nerves of steel...

7
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,875
if you can remain calm
no matter what happens...

8
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,208
there should be no problem
you can't handle.

9
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,792
It's really all
a matter of character.

10
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,042
Of course,
if I had any character...

11
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:58,208
I wouldn't have stolen
$2 million from my boss.

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,583
Christmas Eve.

13
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,458
Ho, ho, fucking ho.

14
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,417
Well? How did it go?

15
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,125
Good. Went good.

16
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:02,333
How much?

17
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,458
A lot.

18
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,333
Am I gonna have to slap
the shit out of you? How much?

19
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,958
Vic, it's a great big
fucking pile of money.

20
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,458
$2,147,000 and change.

21
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:25,750
Hmm.

22
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:34,708
My God,
we're actually doing this.

23
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:37,708
No, we're not doing it.

24
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:40,208
It's already done.

25
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,833
Look, don't be so worried.
The hard part's done already.

26
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,625
Everything worked
just like you said it would.

27
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,583
Yeah. I guess.

28
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,083
Just act normal for a few
hours and we're home free.

29
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,958
Okay?
Okay.

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,167
Okay.

31
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,792
You wanna take the money
and not me?

32
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,250
You wanna take the money?

33
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,125
No. I don't know.
I was just...

34
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,083
Well, if you wanna
take the money...

35
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:19,542
I mean, if you think
you can do a better job...

36
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,917
of guarding $2 million...

37
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,125
No, no, no. It should
be you. It should be you.

38
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,583
It's just we didn't
discuss that.

39
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,792
Are we through discussing it?

40
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,708
Or is there more to say
on the subject?

41
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:33,375
No, we're done.

42
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:35,667
Cool. Okay, shut the door.

43
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,208
Okay.
Okay. And, Charlie.

44
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,833
Yeah?
Act normal.

45
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,625
Yeah.

46
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,875
Oh, good! Good.
No, no, no.

47
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:16,792
No, no.
That's none of your business.

48
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:20,000
That's none of your
fucking business, all right?

49
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,958
I don't give a shit,
you toothless old whore.

50
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:38,583
Mom. Mom, I gotta go.

51
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,458
Don't you ever
touch her again!

52
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:45,125
Sidney! Sidney! No! No!

53
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:47,333
Don't hurt him.

54
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,458
Jeez, it's Christmas.

55
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,042
I love you.

56
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,625
Don't be an asshole.

57
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,042
Giselle, come on,
hop up there.

58
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,125
Merry Christmas, Sidney.

59
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,042
Hi, Charlie.
Didn't see you come in.

60
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:05,833
Who gave Rusti the shiner?

61
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,250
Her asshole boyfriend.
Some dipshit guitar player.

62
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,000
I swear to God,
if he comes in here again...

63
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:12,708
I'm gonna break his
fucking fingers.

64
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,750
Jesus, look at this place.

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,125
Just 'cause it's Christmas...

66
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,208
people all of a sudden
can't look at tits and ass?

67
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,500
Hi, Renata.
Hello, Counselor.

68
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,917
Not drinking tonight?

69
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,042
Just watching the floorshow.

70
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:33,333
Sidney, get my favorite
crooked lawyer a beer.

71
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,042
Actually, I'll take a rum.

72
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,208
Rum?
Mmm-hmm.

73
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,167
Rum and what?
Got any pineapple juice?

74
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,542
If you got one of those
little plastic umbrellas...

75
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,583
you can put that thing
in there.

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,125
What?

77
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,125
You look like the cat that
swallowed the canary, is what.

78
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,000
Like you're about
to belch a feather.

79
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,083
Been working on this
acquisition deal for a while...

80
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:03,583
and it finally came through,
so...

81
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,042
Is this
a Bill Guerrard thing?

82
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:07,458
No, this is a... No.

83
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:11,458
Charlie Arglist.

84
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,750
Man of mystery.

85
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,542
This mean
you're rich, Charlie?

86
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,375
'Cause if you are,
we could run away together.

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,375
It's a thought.

88
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,167
Leaving Wichita.

89
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,708
Damn right, it's a thought.

90
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,958
Come the first of the year, there'll
be no more nude dancing in the city.

91
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,708
Which means
I'm fucked.

92
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,375
And don't tell me, "Move
out to the county," either.

93
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,042
Because Bill Guerrard's
got the county all to himself.

94
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,875
And I don't think
he's looking for competition.

95
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,917
Isn't that right,
Charlie?

96
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:43,750
You should let me
help you out.

97
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,208
If I was real smart, I'd
see this as an opportunity.

98
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,417
I could, you know.
Could what?

99
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,417
Help you.
You, Charlie?

100
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,375
If you had that photo...

101
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:01,417
Of Councilman Williams
and Cupcake? Mmm-hmm.

102
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,375
Vic's got that photo.

103
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,208
And I know
he won't give it to me...

104
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,875
because I've asked him nice
and he just won't.

105
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:12,583
Well, he wouldn't
have to know.

106
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:15,083
Well, that would be
just about...

107
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,208
the nicest Christmas present
you could give me, Charlie.

108
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:22,417
I'd have to think of something
extra nice to give you in return.

109
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,750
No. Forget it.

110
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:34,333
I appreciate the thought, but you'd
be getting in way over your head.

111
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,583
Vic Cavanaugh and Bill Guerrard
eat guys like you for lunch.

112
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,333
Sidney.
Yo.

113
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,708
I'll be back later
to close up.

114
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:47,083
It's against my religion
to give out personal advice...

115
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,750
but you should either sober up
or get real drunk.

116
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,125
That's fucking horrible.
Toss it and give me a beer.

117
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:22,417
"As Wichita falls,
so falls Wichita Falls. "

118
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:37,833
Have you seen
Charlie tonight?

119
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,542
No. You just missed him.

120
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,750
How about Vic?
Seen Vic?

121
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,667
No. Not yet.

122
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,875
Of course,
it is Christmas.

123
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:53,292
Yeah, right.
Christmas.

124
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,250
"As Wichita falls,
so falls Wichita Falls. "

125
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,792
What sort of fucking moron
would write such a thing?

126
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:21,667
Roy Gelles is in town.

127
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:25,125
Vic, did you hear me?

128
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,583
Roy Gelles is in town.

129
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,667
So what?
So he's looking for us.

130
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,750
So maybe he knows.
That's what.

131
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,333
Roy Gelles doesn't know shit.

132
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,042
Roy Gelles knows
what Bill Guerrard tells him.

133
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,875
And Bill doesn't know
shit either, so chill out.

134
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,708
Then what is he doing in town
on Christmas Eve?

135
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,542
Thank you, sweetie.
I appreciate it.

136
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,375
He's got a daughter in town.
Maybe he's visiting her.

137
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,750
Like you said,
it's Christmas.

138
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:45,875
That still doesn't explain
why he's at the Sweet Cage.

139
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,000
Listen, Charlie, don't go
squirrelly on me now, okay?

140
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,708
Just stick to the plan.

141
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,917
Maybe we should leave now.

142
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,125
Well, we're not going to.

143
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,667
In case you haven't noticed, it's
a fucking hockey rink out there.

144
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,292
Oh, my God,
what have I done?

145
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,542
What?
Nothing.

146
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:01,458
They say the rain is
supposed to stop by midnight.

147
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,708
By 5:00 in the morning,
we're in Kansas City...

148
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,875
where we enjoy a leisurely
breakfast at the airport...

149
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,833
and by 8:00, we're on a plane
to someplace warm...

150
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,542
where it's against
the fucking law to rain, okay?

151
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,667
Click.

152
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,750
Vic? Vic?

153
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,667
Fuck me.

154
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

155
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,667
Fuck.

156
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,542
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

157
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,792
Hi, Mr. Arglist.
I didn't recognize you.

158
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:37,750
Hi.

159
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,500
Yeah. Boy, I didn't realize
how slippery that was.

160
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,708
Yeah. Didn't you notice all the
cars off the side of the road?

161
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,000
I wasn't paying close
enough attention, I guess.

162
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,750
You going somewhere, Mr. Arglist? No.

163
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,000
Hey, none of my business,
right?

164
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,250
I'd be careful, though.

165
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:56,750
We're gonna have this freezing
rain on and off all night...

166
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,292
so I'd stay off the road...

167
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,208
and probably take it easy
with that, too.

168
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,167
The next guy
who pulls you over...

169
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:06,417
might be somebody
who don't know any better.

170
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,708
I definitely owe you one.

171
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,750
All right. It's Tyler.
It's R.P. Tyler.

172
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,500
Remember my name
to Mr. Guerrard.

173
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:13,792
I will.

174
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:15,250
What is it?

175
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,708
Just kidding. Just kidding.

176
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,250
Have a merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

177
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,042
Dickhead.

178
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:31,208
I'm not working Christmas
for no fucking money, Dennis.

179
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,417
I'm not.

180
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,375
I could be at home spending
Christmas with my kids.

181
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:37,458
Your kids with your husband,
Francie. They in Denver.

182
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,375
Fuck you very much
for throwing that in my face.

183
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,750
Look, you can cry all you
want, but you're still going on.

184
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:43,875
You've been here long enough
to know the goddamn drill.

185
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,167
You wanna work on the hot nights,
you gotta work on the cold.

186
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,542
Fuck it, Dennis.

187
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,542
I'm not paying Bill Guerrard
a $100 stage rental fee...

188
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:54,208
so some old pervert can look at
my twat on Christmas fucking Eve!

189
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,375
Go dance.

190
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,333
Tell you what.
Since it's Christmas Eve...

191
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,750
stage rental's on the house.

192
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,208
Hi, Charlie.
I didn't see you come in.

193
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,208
Hi.

194
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,208
You mean it?

195
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,625
Uh-huh.

196
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,083
Gee, thanks.

197
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:13,292
Since when are you a friend
of the working girl?

198
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,833
It's Christmas, Dennis.
It's God's birthday.

199
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,792
Well, hello there, Councilman.

200
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,458
So, Dennis, you're saying
you haven't seen Charlie, huh?

201
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,792
Charlie? No.
Why do you ask?

202
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,292
How about Vic Cavanaugh?
You seen him?

203
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,958
Dude, I don't do henchmen,
man. I do strippers.

204
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:59,125
Hey, Frankie.
Is Vic around?

205
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:00,792
He's sitting over there.

206
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,042
Let me get you a drink.
Thanks.

207
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,292
Victor.

208
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,500
You know, us being seen
together, tonight of all nights...

209
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,125
is probably not so smart.

210
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,708
I would have called...

211
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:18,750
but I had
a bit of a situation.

212
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,708
So, guess who's
over at the Tease.

213
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,875
Roy Gelles.
I just spoke to him.

214
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,125
You just spoke to him?
Yeah, I spoke to him.

215
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,250
Come on, man. What the
fuck... What did he say?

216
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,625
What's wrong with you? He just
called to wish me a merry Christmas.

217
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,042
Well, what
did you say?

218
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,708
Well, I wished him
a merry Christmas.

219
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,917
What did he say?

220
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,500
What the hell
are you so worried about?

221
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,083
Vic, I sue people
for a living.

222
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,208
You sell them pornography.

223
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,958
Roy hurts people.

224
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,792
He makes it so their knees and
elbows bend in both directions.

225
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,042
That worries me.

226
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,167
Let me ask you something.

227
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,458
Did I make a mistake when I
made you my partner in this deal?

228
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,500
Hey! You didn't make me your partner.
I am the one who showed you...

229
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,250
how to steal $2 million worth
of Bill Guerrard's money.

230
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,333
Then I showed you how to do it so
he wouldn't know what you'd done...

231
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,708
till it was too late.

232
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,958
What we've done, okay?

233
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,333
Remember that.
What we've done.

234
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,458
And here's the thing
about what we've done.

235
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,917
Mr. Arglist?

236
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,625
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

237
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:22,292
Left to yourself, you'd
still be on a barstool...

238
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,000
thinking about
how it could be done...

239
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:28,042
if somebody had the balls
to do it. Which is me.

240
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,708
Don't poke, Vic, okay?
I get it.

241
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,625
Hello.

242
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,417
Yeah.

243
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,708
I know that.
I know that.

244
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,958
I know that, too.

245
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,542
All right,
I gotta get out of here.

246
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,875
So, I'll meet you
at the Velvet Touch at 1:00.

247
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,125
Just like we planned,
all right? Who was that?

248
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,917
Not that it's any
of your fucking business.

249
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,875
That was my wife.

250
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,917
Thank you.
Thank you, sweetie.

251
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,750
The lovely Gladys, of whom you've
heard me speak over the years...

252
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,667
with tenderness
and affection.

253
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,583
She was wondering
if I'm gonna be home...

254
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,333
in time for midnight worship.

255
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,292
I thought that's who you were...
Oh, having dinner with? No, no.

256
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,042
See, Gladys is
on the Subway Diet.

257
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,625
She has a couple of foot-longs
at lunch, couple at dinner.

258
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,125
Buys her clothes
from Omar the Tentmaker.

259
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,375
But perhaps I'm being unkind.

260
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,333
Anyway, let me out of here.

261
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,708
Hey, Vic.
Yeah?

262
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:46,958
If you wouldn't mind, you know,
in case we get separated...

263
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,333
tell me where the money is.

264
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,583
Excuse me, Mr. Arglist.

265
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,250
That's hilarious.

266
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,250
He's something else.
Yeah.

267
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,167
Mr. Arglist, I wonder
if I might have a word?

268
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:58,625
Sure. Vic!

269
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:01,083
Mr. Arglist, I'm sorry to bother you.

270
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:03,042
I believe
you can help us.

271
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,375
Peter Van Heuten is a
friend of yours, right?

272
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,792
Yes.

273
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,708
He's in no shape to drive...

274
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:12,083
Charlie fucking Arglist!

275
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:15,667
Yo ho ho, mo-fo!
What are you doing here, man?

276
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,583
Hiya, Pete.
Merry Christmas!

277
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,500
It's good to see you!
Good to see you!

278
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:23,042
What are you doing here, man?
The real people are in there.

279
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,542
Let's go in here.

280
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:28,375
Everybody, I want you to meet...
Listen up, a friend of mine...

281
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,167
This is Charlie Arglist, the
most talented and handsome...

282
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,625
mob lawyer in all of Kansas.

283
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,583
I really wish you
wouldn't do that. Come on.

284
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,667
Come on. That was Vic Cavanaugh you
were hanging out with back there.

285
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,792
So what? Hey, let me ask you a question.

286
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,792
Is it true that one time...

287
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,750
he cut the hand off of somebody
who stuck their fingers...

288
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:50,000
up the twazzallah of a
dancer over at Tease-O-Rama?

289
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:51,083
Look around at the bar.

290
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:53,750
Do you see a lot
of one-armed men in here?

291
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,333
Because if they chopped off
the hand...

292
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,125
of every guy who tried
that with a stripper...

293
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,958
half the men in Wichita
would be wearing hooks.

294
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,083
Are you trying to tell me that these
are just normal guys you work for?

295
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,250
What are you doing here?

296
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,417
Trying to get my ashes hauled,
like everybody else!

297
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,333
Noël, Joyeux Noëll

298
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,333
It's all right.
He's drunk.

299
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,250
Sarabeth isn't performing
that function anymore?

300
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,792
Did she do that
for you oftentimes...

301
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,208
throughout your saga?

302
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:19,333
Occasionally. Not very often. Mmm-hmm.

303
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:21,833
Is she still wearing
flannel to bed?

304
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,000
Silly me.

305
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,333
I thought, until I met
and married Sarabeth...

306
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,083
that it was
only little children...

307
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,458
who wore those things with
the feet sewn on the bottom.

308
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,917
You could have warned me
about that.

309
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,792
And I'm actually
being kind of serious here.

310
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:35,500
I tried to, Pete.
I really did.

311
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,625
Yeah, bullshit. I was the end
of your alimony problem.

312
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,167
That's what I was.
Like hell. You were in love.

313
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,333
With my wife.

314
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:43,667
Love.

315
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,667
Someday somebody is going
to tally up the cost...

316
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,708
of that particular illusion.

317
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,917
Hey.
Yeah?

318
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:54,708
Did you ever go and...

319
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,375
The strippers?
Yeah, occasionally.

320
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:58,625
Yeah?
Yeah, sure.

321
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,083
When I'm really desperate...

322
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,417
or completely shit-faced, or
generally have my head up my ass.

323
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm all those three things
right now, baby. Let's go!

324
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:06,417
So how you doing
otherwise, buddy?

325
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,000
Great. Great. Really great.

326
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,792
Drawing a lot of buildings.
Making a fucking fortune.

327
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,958
Well, listen.
I gotta make a phone call.

328
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,208
If you just hold down
the fort here and remain calm.

329
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,667
Remain calm.

330
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,792
Big mob lawyer.

331
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,333
Sweet Cage.
Sidney, is Renata back yet?

332
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,208
No. She just called.
Said she's on her way.

333
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:42,792
All right, listen...

334
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,917
when she gets back, you tell
her I have that present...

335
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:47,167
that I mentioned for her
earlier and not to leave.

336
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,333
Okay? Bye.

337
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,542
Mr. Arglist.
Councilman.

338
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,125
I wonder if we might
have a quiet word.

339
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,667
Actually, I'm kind of...

340
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,625
Would you be good enough to deliver
a message from me to Mr. Guerrard?

341
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,208
Wichita is a community
of good people, Mr. Arglist.

342
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,333
Christian people.

343
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,042
Yeah, half of them are in this
very bar trying to get laid.

344
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:11,708
That may well be. But my
point is, some time ago...

345
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,750
in a moment of weakness,
I did a very foolish thing.

346
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,125
And that foolish thing
was photographed.

347
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,792
I believe that photo is in the
possession of a Mr. Vic Cavanaugh...

348
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,250
an associate of yours,
who refuses to surrender it...

349
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,333
despite several generous
offers for its purchase...

350
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,500
the last of which,
delivered not 10 minutes ago.

351
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,208
People can be stubborn.

352
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:35,917
Do you think Mr. Guerrard would be
able to persuade Mr. Cavanaugh...

353
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,958
Oh.

354
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,458
...to reconsider if he understood
his own interests in the matter?

355
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:45,500
Well, Mr. Guerrard is one of
the most persuasive men I know.

356
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:48,125
What kind of figures
are we talking about here?

357
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,750
Are we talking about four?
Five? Six?

358
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,625
Five, Mr. Arglist.
Low five.

359
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,417
Councilman, I think
the photo in question...

360
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,500
might be closer than
you can possibly imagine.

361
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,792
You've given me hope, Mr.
Arglist. Merry Christmas.

362
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,875
Wonderful season, isn't it? So
full of mutual understanding.

363
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,167
Yeah.

364
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:16,083
You gotta know the whole
culture is in the toilet...

365
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,542
if a guy dressed like that can
get laid in a place like this.

366
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,542
Hey, you're flipping off the
mob here, just so you know.

367
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,042
Did I mention to you that I
really wish you wouldn't do that?

368
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,208
Yeah.

369
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:30,125
M- O-B, mob. Okay?
All right, let's go.

370
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,042
Right back at you, huh?

371
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,500
And there, that one, too.
There, see?

372
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,000
That's my chair in there.

373
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,083
You wanna know the truth?

374
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,292
I can't fill it.

375
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,542
Neither could I, if it
makes you feel any better.

376
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:14,833
Listen, Charlie.

377
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,833
Before we go in, there's
something I have to tell you.

378
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,833
It's been on my conscience, and
you can punch me if you want to.

379
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,750
I don't think
I'm gonna want to.

380
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,583
Back when you and Sarabeth were
still married that last year...

381
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:29,583
Uh-huh.

382
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,542
...she and I
were fucking.

383
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:34,833
No kidding?

384
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:40,708
Like minks. Everywhere.
Kitchen table, your bed, garage.

385
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,125
Wow.

386
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,833
Jesus, Charlie,
we were friends.

387
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,250
It doesn't make you angry?

388
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,000
Actually, it makes me curious.

389
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,292
Makes me wonder
who she's fucking now.

390
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,625
Yo ho ho!
Merry fucking Christmas!

391
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:06,042
Guess who I brought with me?
Ghost of Christmas Past.

392
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,667
Ooh.

393
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:10,583
Marley!
Get the fuck in here.

394
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:12,833
Hey, everybody.

395
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,208
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

396
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,208
Hello, Charlie.

397
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,417
Come in
and have a piece of pie.

398
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,375
Hi, Dottie.
No, thank you. I'm fine.

399
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,958
I just wanted to stop in and
wish you all a very merry...

400
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,708
Screw the pie, you old harpy.
We're here for dinner.

401
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:33,042
Turkey, cranberry,
stuffing, the works!

402
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,042
Thanks. Yeah.

403
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,208
Yeah. Motherfucker.
Yeah.

404
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,208
Turkey-alurkey.

405
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,958
Pathetic.

406
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,208
What did you say, Stan?

407
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,125
You two are pathetic.
Makes me ashamed to be a man.

408
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:54,500
I'm pathetic?
I'm pathetic?

409
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,667
Who paid for that
hip replacement...

410
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:58,917
your insurance company
wouldn't cover, huh?

411
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:01,167
Dad, tell me that!

412
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,458
And who took care of your mortgage
payments when you were recuperating?

413
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:07,292
And when you're
done with that...

414
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,792
maybe you could
explain to me who it was...

415
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,708
raised his only daughter...

416
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:15,583
to be a cold, gossiping,
hypocritical bitch!

417
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,625
So, Spence, how you doing?
Go to hell.

418
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:29,208
Don't you talk
to your father that way.

419
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:32,000
He's not my father. He didn't
even send us presents this year.

420
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,458
I hate his guts.

421
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:35,875
Is that right, Charlie?

422
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,250
You didn't even send them
any Christmas presents?

423
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:40,333
No.
Christmas is tomorrow.

424
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:42,917
Guess what, Daddy?
I was in the Christmas play.

425
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,917
So what?

426
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,833
All you were was Tiny Tim's sister,
and you didn't even have any lines!

427
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,250
And he didn't even
come to watch!

428
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,792
He would have, but Mommy
didn't send an invitation!

429
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,958
I'm sorry, Charlie,
but maybe you should go now.

430
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,958
And perhaps you would give
Pete a ride home?

431
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:01,667
Sarabeth and the children
will be staying here tonight.

432
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,250
Okay.
Yeah.

433
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,417
Listen, sweetie,
I'm gonna go...

434
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,542
and I'm gonna come back and
visit you tomorrow, all right?

435
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:09,833
Don't believe him, Melissa. He's
lying. All he ever does is lie.

436
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:11,000
Shut up!

437
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,875
Merry Christmas, Charlie.

438
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:28,542
On the whole,
I thought that went well.

439
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:30,458
Yeah, it's good
to see the family.

440
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:33,500
What do you say, one more
drink? The night is young.

441
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:36,875
All right, one more,
that's it. Okay. One more.

442
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:50,917
Melissa really misses you.

443
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,667
Not Spencer. He hates me.

444
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:58,917
You just gotta give him time.
He'll come around.

445
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,958
Your leaving came
at an awkward age for him.

446
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,917
A clean break is best.

447
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:07,583
No, a clean break is easiest.
On you.

448
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,292
Oh.

449
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:13,667
Are you saying
you have no regrets?

450
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,750
Don't believe in them.

451
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:19,125
Bullshit.
Everybody has regrets.

452
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:22,917
Guys our age,
what else is there?

453
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,708
I ever tell you
my father was a twin?

454
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,375
Identical?
Fraternal.

455
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,917
Looked a lot alike, though,
him and my uncle.

456
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,458
Different temperaments
completely.

457
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,958
My father, he's a cop.

458
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,708
By-the-book guy.

459
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:47,542
Believed in the law. Wanted
his only son to be a lawyer.

460
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,000
Drank in moderation,
didn't smoke.

461
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,625
Kept up his
life insurance premiums.

462
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:55,583
Voted in every election,
not just for president.

463
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:58,667
Let me guess.
Uncle didn't vote.

464
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:01,875
He said he didn't want
to encourage the bastards.

465
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,875
In and out of jail
from the time he was 16...

466
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,583
drunk all the time,
fucked everything that walked.

467
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,958
Won a fortune playing poker,
lost it all the same way.

468
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,042
Lost an eye in a fight.
Half his life...

469
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:16,208
So what you're trying to say
is, you take after your uncle.

470
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,917
I wasn't finished.

471
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:22,000
My father was 54...

472
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:25,250
when he died of a massive
embolism, right here in Wichita.

473
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,667
My uncle
died the very next day...

474
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:33,208
in a car wreck in California.

475
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,333
So the point is...

476
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:40,250
it is futile to regret.

477
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:44,875
You do one thing,
you do another...

478
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,250
I mean, so what?

479
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,417
What's the difference?
Same result.

480
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:59,792
How many of these lights
you gonna sit through?

481
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:02,167
See if I tell you
another fucking story.

482
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:07,292
Sorry, guys, we're closed.

483
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:09,708
We just want one drink.
Each.

484
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:14,500
My friend's a mobster. You
might know that, you might not.

485
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:18,167
I'll tell you what. I'll
give you one, on the house...

486
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,625
if you drink it up and leave.

487
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:21,292
But I'm not opening
my register back up.

488
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,083
Thank you, gorgeous.

489
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,333
Do you know where this last
drink is going to take me?

490
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:29,958
To that perfect stage
of drunkenness.

491
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,375
And then, do you know
what I'm going to do?

492
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:36,583
I'm going to go straight home,
go to bed, and dream of you.

493
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:42,625
I don't think I'd pursue
that particular line.

494
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,250
You with him?
Yeah.

495
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:46,667
Makes no difference.
It's okay.

496
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,708
It's a free country.

497
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:51,708
And any man can dream
anything he wants to dream.

498
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:53,042
And tonight
I'm gonna dream of you.

499
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:54,958
All right, I gotta make a
phone call. I'll be right back.

500
00:28:55,042 --> 00:28:56,375
Okay, behave yourself.

501
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,458
Sweet Cage.
Sidney, is Renata back yet?

502
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:01,000
No. Not yet.

503
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,500
But you won't believe
who just walked in.

504
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,083
Roy Gelles? No. Forget
Roy Gelles, will you?

505
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,042
That fucking guitar player.

506
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,958
The one who gave Rusti
the black eye.

507
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,333
What's going on?

508
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,625
I swear to God...

509
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,292
if he gives Rusti any trouble, I'm
gonna break his fucking fingers.

510
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,583
What's your name,
jock strap?

511
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:20,875
Which hand should I break?

512
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,042
I don't have the answer
to that question, Sidney.

513
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:25,208
Listen, when Renata gets
back in, just tell her...

514
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,917
I know.
You got a present for her.

515
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:29,000
I hope you don't think she's
gonna fuck you, Charlie.

516
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,583
Think it's out of the
question? Absolutely.

517
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:33,708
Merry Christmas, Sidney.

518
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,292
Yeah.
Merry Christmas, Charlie.

519
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,375
Would you like to know what
you're going to be wearing...

520
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:44,042
in my little dream?
Disregard him.

521
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,083
Hmm.

522
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:49,333
That fish necklace,
and that's it.

523
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:51,917
Completely disregard him
tonight. He's drunk.

524
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:55,375
Except for that necklace, you're
gonna be one naked little Christian.

525
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,375
Pete, not that you're asking
for my advice...

526
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:03,583
but, listen, I would shut
the fuck up right now.

527
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:06,042
Yeah.

528
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:09,875
Hey. Sporty Nuts.
Pete.

529
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:14,208
If you don't get laid tonight,
fish necklace or no...

530
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,458
it's 'cause
you're not trying, my son.

531
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,167
Pete, I hope you're
listening to me.

532
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,750
And if you play
your cards right...

533
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:23,833
this hot-assed
little Jesus freak...

534
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:28,208
just might initiate you into the
Campus Crusade for Cunnilingus.

535
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:32,750
Do you notice that I am practicing
non-violent resistance...

536
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:36,083
in honor
of the Christmas holiday?

537
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:38,583
Because that's the way...

538
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:42,458
baby Jesus
would have wanted me to do it.

539
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:49,708
That was unpleasant.
I think I scraped my tummy.

540
00:30:58,042 --> 00:30:59,000
Hmm.

541
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:00,500
Oh, my nuts.

542
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,458
I got it. I got it.

543
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:09,333
You sure?
I got it.

544
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,250
Oh, fuck.

545
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:30,833
Jesus Christ, Pete, you had
the whole goddamn parking lot.

546
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:33,083
Why did you have
to throw up in the car?

547
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:37,833
I think that boy drove one of my
testicles up into my body cavity.

548
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:39,333
Are you sure?

549
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:41,875
I don't know
where else it could be.

550
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,542
Okay, bounce me.

551
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,750
Again, again.

552
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,042
Now, three times fast.
Three times fast!

553
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,708
If you're trying to shake the
money out of his pockets...

554
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:04,375
you gotta turn him
upside down first.

555
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:06,833
Right.

556
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:09,375
Think that did it.

557
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,667
One, two. Yup.

558
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,875
We did it.

559
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,917
You have a good night,
Mr. Arglist.

560
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,500
Good night, now.

561
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:37,292
Take me home, buddy.
I know my limit.

562
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:39,542
You are home,
for Christ's sake, Pete.

563
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,042
Pants, pants, pants.

564
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,167
I got it, I got it,
I got it.

565
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,583
Do you remember
when you used to live here?

566
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,167
Do you remember?
Yeah. I remember.

567
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,083
This used to be your house.
Come on.

568
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:59,875
I got it, I got it, I got it.

569
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I know the way.

570
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:03,000
Are you sure?
Buddy, I got it.

571
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:05,833
All right.
I got it, okay?

572
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,083
Man down.

573
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:14,625
Man down.

574
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:19,167
I thought I had it.

575
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:20,875
But I didn't.

576
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,333
I didn't have it.

577
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,042
Man still down.

578
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,167
Man remains down.

579
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,167
Get some rest, pal.

580
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:28,667
Stop! Stop it!

581
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:32,208
Oh, fuck!

582
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,208
Oh my God!

583
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,125
Hi, Rusti.
Is Renata inside?

584
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:39,792
Oh, fuck!

585
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:42,500
Charlie, did you meet Donny?
Ronny.

586
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:45,833
Yeah. Donny had this giant
crush on me back in high school.

587
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,208
Only I had no idea.

588
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:50,042
We had two classes together,
chemistry and something else.

589
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,250
We can't remember.

590
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,208
Anyway, so we're talking...

591
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,708
and remembering old times,
and guess what?

592
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,625
We're getting married.

593
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,042
Oh, fuck!

594
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,667
Great.
Oh, God!

595
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,542
Listen. Let this night
be a reminder to you...

596
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,958
when you think
about using her...

597
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,208
As a punching bag.
All right?

598
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,208
All right? Don't... All right? Sidney.

599
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,792
Sidney.
All right.

600
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:18,292
You do hear that siren, right?
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,042
Look, Charlie,
my blood was up, you know?

602
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,542
My mother's always telling me
I need to work on my anger.

603
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,625
Channel my energies
into something more positive.

604
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,042
Makes me
want to slap her silly.

605
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,208
Jesus Christ, Sidney, you
don't hit your mother, do you?

606
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,542
Christ, no.

607
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:34,250
Charlie, I'm talking about
desires here, that's all.

608
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:35,625
Urges and shit.

609
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:38,708
Anyway, I gotta go.
Gotta pick up the kids.

610
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,167
We're going to Six Flags
tomorrow.

611
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:41,458
Good.
Yeah.

612
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,083
Is she back?
Oh, yeah.

613
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,417
She's gonna be pissed at me
'cause I'm leaving early.

614
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:48,333
That's okay. I got something
for her, to cheer her up.

615
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:51,667
Damn. You can read the
fine print on the lubricant.

616
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:56,333
I didn't know you smoked.
I don't.

617
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:03,583
I guess I thought
you'd be happier. Happy?

618
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:07,792
I'm fucking ecstatic.
Can't you tell?

619
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:13,583
And in return for this,
you want exactly what?

620
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,417
Nothing.

621
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,208
Nothing.

622
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:25,750
Charlie, I've been hearing
weird things about you all night.

623
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:26,792
Like what?

624
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:29,458
Like waiving stage rentals
over at the Tease-O-Rama.

625
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,917
Comping dancers' drinks?
Not like you at all.

626
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,083
And now this.

627
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,083
Oh, my God.

628
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,875
You are leaving town.

629
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:58,833
Have you and Vic
been dipping into the till?

630
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:01,500
Steal from Bill?
That would be crazy.

631
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:09,417
Well, then there's only one
other possible explanation.

632
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:18,208
You're in love with me.

633
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,625
I've always liked you.

634
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:24,500
I've noticed.

635
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:36,167
Tell you what.
What?

636
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:40,500
Give me 45 minutes to close up,
then meet me at my apartment.

637
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:42,667
All right.

638
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:44,500
Okay.

639
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,708
I forgot. Vic called.

640
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,750
Said to tell you that you
were right and he was wrong.

641
00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:01,417
Something about a guy you
thought might be looking for you.

642
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,958
Yeah?
He is.

643
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,167
This was when?

644
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:07,167
About half an hour ago.

645
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,417
Vic said for you to meet him at
the Velvet Touch as soon as you can.

646
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:14,583
You sure nothing's going on?
Not a thing.

647
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,917
Don't forget to come back,
okay?

648
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,500
I won't.

649
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:41,042
Vic.

650
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:02,125
Harder. Oh, yeah.

651
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:09,833
Vic, hate to interrupt!

652
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,875
Yeah, baby.

653
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,208
Come on, Vic.

654
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,625
Don't stop.

655
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:17,958
Almost there.

656
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,917
Keep going. Keep going.

657
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:33,625
Vic?

658
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,833
Fuck! Oh, fuck.

659
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,042
Mr. Arglist?

660
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,000
Oh, fuck!

661
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:42,333
Ouch, that had to hurt.
Yeah, it sure did.

662
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:44,375
What were you doing?

663
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:47,208
I was gonna be sick,
but now I'm okay.

664
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:49,917
Different car.

665
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,333
Yeah, it's my ex-wife's.
It's a long story.

666
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,250
You don't look too good.

667
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,500
You want me to call somebody
to come get you?

668
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:59,375
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm headed home anyway.

669
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,458
Okay, Mr. Arglist. You go
home and get some sleep.

670
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:05,125
And don't forget to put in a good
word for me with Mr. Guerrard.

671
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:07,292
I will, Officer.
Officer what?

672
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:11,625
Taylor.
Tyler.

673
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,792
But it's pretty close, though. Yeah.

674
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,917
All right, tell you what.
When you go home...

675
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,875
I don't think I'd come back out
again tonight, if I were you.

676
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:23,208
No, I probably won't.
Good night to you.

677
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:26,083
Happy holidays.
Okay. All the best.

678
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:32,000
Oh, fuck.

679
00:42:49,292 --> 00:42:50,792
Hello?
Renata.

680
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,083
Charlie.
Listen.

681
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:56,250
You were right.
Vic and I have been skimming.

682
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,333
Well, duh.

683
00:42:57,417 --> 00:42:59,375
I think Roy Gelles
must have found out...

684
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,958
and I think
he might have killed Vic.

685
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:04,292
That's terrible.

686
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:06,750
So, I was thinking it might
be best if I left town.

687
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:09,000
I was wondering
if you wanted to come with me.

688
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,958
You have the money?
What?

689
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:15,292
Which...
The money we're talking about.

690
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:17,042
That you and Vic
have been skimming.

691
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:18,667
Try to keep up, okay?

692
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,167
No. Vic had it.

693
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:23,208
So, your idea is that we should
run away together and be poor?

694
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,542
I thought I'd give it a shot.

695
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:27,042
Here's the thing, though.

696
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:30,417
Roy wouldn't have killed Vic unless
Vic told him where the money was...

697
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:32,208
which means Roy has it now.

698
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,708
Well, why don't you sneak up
behind him...

699
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:38,292
and hit him over the head
with something and take it?

700
00:43:38,417 --> 00:43:40,833
Me? You want me
to sneak up on Roy Gelles?

701
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:43,417
Charlie, think of this
as your defining moment.

702
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:45,667
This is your chance
to be something more.

703
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,292
Like a murderer?

704
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,583
This is your chance
to start over, Charlie.

705
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:52,750
Our chance,
if that's what you want.

706
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:54,292
If that's what I want.

707
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,542
Listen, I just gotta
ask you one thing.

708
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
What?

709
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:04,667
I didn't have
a specific question planned.

710
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:06,542
Nothing, sorry.

711
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:07,792
Well, then...

712
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,458
Gladys.

713
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,958
Gladys, it's me,
Charlie Arglist.

714
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,667
Gladys, where is Vic?

715
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:23,583
It's a sweet thought, Charlie.
But she's already dead.

716
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:26,958
Jesus Christ,
you scared the fuck out of me!

717
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:30,667
I thought you were dead!
I thought Roy killed you.

718
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:32,292
Well, he was going to.

719
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:35,083
But he got sidetracked.
You should have been there.

720
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:36,833
He actually threatened
to shoot Gladys...

721
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:38,917
if I didn't tell him
where the money was.

722
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:40,000
But I think he was counting...

723
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:42,417
on a level of commitment and
affection between her and me...

724
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:43,708
that just simply wasn't there.

725
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:48,000
Where is he now?

726
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:50,083
Follow me.
You're gonna love this.

727
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:05,417
Hey, Roy!

728
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:08,500
You still alive in there?

729
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:12,500
You didn't asphyxiate yet,
did you?

730
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,375
Hey, Vic.

731
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:17,917
Come a little closer,
so I can talk to you.

732
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,125
What's that, Roy?

733
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:22,333
Jesus fucking Christ!

734
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:27,958
Damn it, I took his gun.

735
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:31,958
Guess he must have
another one.

736
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:33,375
Must have.

737
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,333
Is that you, Arglist?

738
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:38,917
Hi, Roy.

739
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,958
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna kill you.

740
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,125
You do know that, right?

741
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:45,292
Roy, you must be
one fucking optimist...

742
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:47,542
if you think you're ever
getting out of that trunk.

743
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:50,125
Let me out, Arglist.
I'm your only hope.

744
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:53,000
Actually, you just told me you'd
kill me if you got out, Roy.

745
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:57,708
I didn't mean it.
Sounded like you did.

746
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,083
I was just pissed off.

747
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:01,042
It's cramped in here
and I'm claustrophobic.

748
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:02,625
Come on.
Give me a hand.

749
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:04,083
Wanna go to the trunk?

750
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:06,833
Already tried it.
Let's go to the back seat.

751
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:08,167
Ready?
Yeah.

752
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:13,167
That's one
big motherfucker.

753
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:17,583
One, two, three!

754
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:29,792
Oh, God damn.

755
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:32,458
We're gonna have to
take the door off.

756
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:35,583
It's not gonna fit. You
want me to get the Mercedes?

757
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,625
Mercedes? What Mercedes?

758
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,625
My ex-wife's. It's a
long story. Don't ask.

759
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:43,625
There is no way that
this thing is gonna fit...

760
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,417
in a piece-of-shit Mercedes
if it don't go in a Lincoln.

761
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:48,792
No, they're surprisingly
spacious, Vic.

762
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,625
I'm offering you a deal,
Arglist.

763
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:52,208
Jesus fucking shit.
Give me something.

764
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:54,583
Don't be an idiot.
God damn it.

765
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:58,083
Fucking shut up!

766
00:48:01,042 --> 00:48:02,708
Shut the fuck up in there!

767
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:05,417
You just keep
your fucking mouth shut, okay?

768
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:09,083
Piece of fucking shit!
God damn it!

769
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:17,292
You keep that up, you're
gonna spring the lock.

770
00:48:19,917 --> 00:48:22,750
What the fuck were you thinking?
Why didn't you just shoot him?

771
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:24,542
And then you could have
put him in the trunk...

772
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:25,958
and you wouldn't need
that footlocker.

773
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:29,000
Because I want the pleasure
of seeing his big ass...

774
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:32,125
sink to the bottom of
Lake Bascombe! That's why!

775
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:35,167
Hey, Roy. Roy?

776
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:39,542
I can't wait for you
to feel the icy water...

777
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,542
seeping into this trunk...

778
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:45,250
shriveling your balls
before you drown!

779
00:48:45,667 --> 00:48:47,458
What if he's reloaded?

780
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:53,833
Well, he's folded up in there
like a card table.

781
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,750
How the hell
is he gonna reload?

782
00:48:55,917 --> 00:48:57,625
I don't know, Vic.

783
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:29,792
She could never
do anything right.

784
00:49:31,417 --> 00:49:32,417
Jesus.

785
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:37,500
What?

786
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,792
Nothing. I just thought you
were gonna put Roy in the trunk.

787
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:44,417
The footlocker might not fit
in the back seat, is all.

788
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:46,167
You're the one
been going on...

789
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:47,667
about how spacious
these fuckers are.

790
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:49,042
And now you're saying
it won't fit?

791
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:51,583
It might. I'm not sure,
is what I'm saying.

792
00:49:52,042 --> 00:49:54,583
One night driving a Mercedes,
and already you're an asshole.

793
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,208
Come on,
help me get this thing.

794
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:03,417
Ow! God damn it!

795
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,833
If I could open
the fucking door...

796
00:50:11,292 --> 00:50:12,417
Okay.

797
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,167
Jesus, Charlie, you're right.
This thing is spacious.

798
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:25,292
There's no way it would
have gone in a Lincoln.

799
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:27,250
Give me the key.
Oh, yeah.

800
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,417
All right.
I gotta get my shit.

801
00:50:33,792 --> 00:50:35,250
Oh, Vic?

802
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:37,667
What?

803
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,458
Whose thumb is this?

804
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:44,250
Oh, yeah. Good news, Roy.
Charlie brought your thumb.

805
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:51,958
So, you think you're
going to go back to Florida?

806
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,667
You know,
I've been thinking about that.

807
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,583
Maybe you shouldn't tell me
where you're going...

808
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:57,208
and I shouldn't tell you
where I'm going.

809
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:59,583
I just think
it's safer that way.

810
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,667
He's going to kill you,
Arglist.

811
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,542
That's where you're going.

812
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:05,500
It's the truth, Arglist!

813
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:07,208
Think about it.

814
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:09,750
Pay no attention
to the man in the trunk.

815
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,292
He's got a gun, Roy. He could
shoot me now if he wanted to.

816
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:22,625
Uh-uh. He needs your help
to unload the car.

817
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:27,583
Once he's deposited me
and his missus in the lake...

818
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:29,167
you're next.

819
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,125
You know what, Roy?

820
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,792
One more word
out of that trunk...

821
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:35,708
and I'm gonna shoot it
at both ends.

822
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:39,542
Because the truth is, I can't
remember which end your head's at.

823
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:49,583
You know, the fact of the
matter is, I should shoot you.

824
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:52,583
What were you doing
in there tonight?

825
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:55,042
What are you talking about?
Well, you're waiving stage fees...

826
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:57,125
you're comping drinks,
being nice to people.

827
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:59,042
You may as well wear a
fucking sign that says:

828
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:02,250
"Hey, I just stole a shitload of
money and now I'm blowing town. "

829
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:04,208
For Christ's sake...
Calm down! It's Christmas.

830
00:52:04,375 --> 00:52:05,792
Everybody's nice
on Christmas.

831
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:09,167
No, Charlie. No. Only
morons are nice at Christmas.

832
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:12,208
And that's a lot of people,
too, Charlie.

833
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:14,792
Especially in Kansas.
But not everybody.

834
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,958
What kind of man
shoots his own wife...

835
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:20,375
in the back of the head
on Christmas Eve?

836
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:22,833
Roy, he already knows
that you shot her, okay?

837
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,250
That's what he told you,
Arglist?

838
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:29,250
What the hell do I want
to shoot his wife for?

839
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:32,625
Bill Guerrard knows about
this whole deal, Arglist.

840
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:34,750
That's not what
you said earlier, Roy...

841
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:36,917
when your thumb
was in the vise.

842
00:52:37,042 --> 00:52:38,958
You'll never make it
out of Wichita.

843
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:41,333
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
did I not warn that asshole...

844
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:42,458
to shut the fuck up?

845
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:44,042
You told him.
You got one chance, Arglist...

846
00:52:44,125 --> 00:52:45,333
That's right. I told him.
Take the wheel.

847
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,417
...and that's me.
Take the fucking wheel!

848
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,458
Think about it!

849
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:56,167
Fucking asshole.

850
00:52:58,292 --> 00:53:00,208
Well, I guess
that was the head end, huh?

851
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:03,750
Where's the thumb?

852
00:53:04,542 --> 00:53:06,292
The thumb,
where's the thumb?

853
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,750
Thank you, sir.

854
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:37,500
There she is.

855
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:43,583
It's kind of beautiful
out here, huh?

856
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:53,500
All right, give her a shove.

857
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:58,833
Well, come on. Open the fucking door
and help me with this goddamn thing.

858
00:53:58,917 --> 00:54:01,292
What do you think
we're here for? Come on.

859
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,375
Jesus.

860
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,542
Hang on! It's caught.

861
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:16,042
Okay.

862
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:24,167
Okay.

863
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,000
Now toss it over.
Come on.

864
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:56,250
For fuck's sake, Charlie,
come on.

865
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:02,833
Fuck, this is heavy.

866
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:04,333
It says, "Keep off. "

867
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:19,708
All right, ready?
Let's go.

868
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:21,833
Think I'd rather push.

869
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:24,542
Okay, fucking push.
I don't give a shit.

870
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:29,917
You're in the way, Charlie.

871
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,625
Okay, let's go. Ready?
Yeah.

872
00:55:57,958 --> 00:55:59,500
It's falling apart.

873
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,500
You know what?
Put it up on its end.

874
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:19,917
Just shove it up.

875
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:22,000
I mean, it's as deep here
as it is any place else.

876
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:24,167
Just throw
the fucking thing over.

877
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:33,625
Vic.

878
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:46,083
God damn it, Roy. That was just
blind fucking luck, you asshole.

879
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:49,875
Give me a hand, Arglist.
I'm all stiff.

880
00:56:58,125 --> 00:57:00,750
Now, as promised.

881
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,792
Well, Roy, the good news is,
you're out of the trunk.

882
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:08,167
The bad news is, you're
down four quarts of blood...

883
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:10,542
and your gun's empty.

884
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:16,292
I'm going to kill you anyway.

885
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,625
Here, hold this.

886
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:21,375
That's an unrealistic goal,
Roy.

887
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,750
You're dead, Roy.

888
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:30,500
Don't just stand there
pretending you're not.

889
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,042
Jesus Christ, Charlie!

890
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:46,958
Throw me a rope or something.
I can't swim!

891
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:48,833
I'm thinking, no.

892
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:52,208
You were gonna kill me,
right, Vic? You asshole!

893
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:56,417
Jesus, you're stupid!

894
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:02,167
All right, that's it!
Fuck you!

895
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:05,667
Look, okay, I'm sorry!

896
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,750
Charlie, I'm sorry!

897
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:10,417
I'm going to throw
the gun away! Look!

898
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:16,125
Oh, God, you have no idea
how cold this water is.

899
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:19,208
Charlie.

900
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:23,625
So long, Vic.

901
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:27,250
Don't you want to know
where the money is?

902
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:30,917
I know where the money is. It's
in the back seat of the Benz.

903
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:33,958
Not a chance! Not a chance.

904
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:36,958
I'm done talking to you, Vic.
I'm through listening to you.

905
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:39,625
If you don't believe me,
look for yourself!

906
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:42,708
Only hurry! Hurry!
I can't feel my legs!

907
00:58:42,792 --> 00:58:44,875
I'm dying here! I'm dying!

908
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:49,542
Charlie! God damn it!

909
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:54,333
I know what I did was wrong!
But, Jesus! Fuck!

910
00:58:57,417 --> 00:59:00,917
I'm shot, Charlie.
I can't pull myself up!

911
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:04,208
Please. Please.

912
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:10,250
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be his name, because...

913
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:12,917
We are kingdom come,
and will be done...

914
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:15,583
and give us every day...

915
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:18,000
our bread,
because we gotta eat...

916
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:25,375
Charlie, is that you? Charlie!

917
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:30,083
I knew it. I knew it.
You're a good man, Charlie.

918
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:31,583
You're a good man.

919
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:34,833
Vic, I wouldn't want you
to die alone.

920
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:43,000
No! No.

921
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:45,167
No!

922
01:00:00,917 --> 01:00:03,000
Vic! Vic, hold on!

923
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05,708
Hold on, Vic.

924
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:08,708
Is that all?

925
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,625
Yeah.

926
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:21,500
Stocking stuffers.

927
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:23,958
Big spender.

928
01:01:24,667 --> 01:01:27,458
Do you have any kids?
No.

929
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,458
Then shut the fuck up.
Bag it.

930
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,333
Hello. Charlie?
Renata.

931
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,583
I'd just about given up.

932
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:42,042
I fucked up.

933
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:44,708
Vic's dead.

934
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:47,125
What about Roy Gelles?

935
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,500
He's dead, too.

936
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,500
Why don't you come over?

937
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:56,792
I'll wait here for you.
The front door's open.

938
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:59,458
No. I don't see the point.
I mean...

939
01:02:00,167 --> 01:02:02,125
I don't have the money.

940
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:04,708
Vic died before he told me
where it was.

941
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:08,583
You know what?
Money isn't everything.

942
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,708
Excuse me?

943
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:14,833
You know what I said before?
It's true, isn't it?

944
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:20,292
You're in love with me.
Yeah.

945
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:22,708
Sure. I guess.

946
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,000
I've still got to ask you
something.

947
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,208
What?

948
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:35,083
I don't have it yet.
I'm sorry.

949
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,042
But you're coming over?
Yeah. Sure.

950
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,792
See you.

951
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:21,875
Take me with you, man.
Oh, fuck.

952
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,458
Jesus, Pete.
No, I mean it.

953
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:27,917
Take me with you, buddy.

954
01:03:30,542 --> 01:03:34,208
I can't do my life, man.
I can't do it.

955
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:36,208
Just get some rest.

956
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:38,583
I hate myself.
I want a new life.

957
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:44,083
You don't want mine.
I really do.

958
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:47,833
I'm in trouble.

959
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:52,417
I'm in big fucking trouble.

960
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:55,000
But that'd be great.
Don't you see?

961
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:56,750
We go out in a blaze of glory.

962
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:02,167
Like men.
Like men, Charlie.

963
01:04:04,667 --> 01:04:07,292
No goddamn life left
for men anymore.

964
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:10,333
Not here.

965
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,750
This country, all that's left
for men is money and pussy.

966
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:18,875
But together,
you and me together...

967
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:30,292
Don't you think?

968
01:06:12,292 --> 01:06:14,583
Come on. Hurry up.

969
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:17,292
Bill Guerrard
is around here somewhere.

970
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,417
Oh.
Yeah, "Oh. "

971
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:28,250
Where is he?

972
01:06:28,292 --> 01:06:30,042
Oh.

973
01:06:30,042 --> 01:06:32,625
Hide behind the door and
shoot him when he comes in.

974
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:35,667
You don't happen to have
any bullets for this, do you?

975
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:44,750
Shotgun behind the bar.

976
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,208
"As Wichita falls...

977
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,333
"so falls Wichita Falls. "

978
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:54,083
I like that.

979
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:56,792
And I'm gonna give your
pussy-whipped pal Arglist...

980
01:06:56,958 --> 01:06:59,500
another 15 minutes
to rescue your sweet ass.

981
01:07:00,667 --> 01:07:04,500
After which time I'm going to assume
his brain overruled his pecker.

982
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:08,458
Well, Bill,
that's just not enough time.

983
01:07:08,917 --> 01:07:10,792
He lives way across town.

984
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:14,292
Yeah? Well, that's your bad luck.
I should be home in Kansas City...

985
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:16,917
watching my kids
open their Christmas presents!

986
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:18,542
Now I gotta waste
the whole fucking day...

987
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:20,250
looking for that nitwit!

988
01:07:21,292 --> 01:07:23,583
I'll never understand lawyers.

989
01:07:24,792 --> 01:07:28,625
I mean, here they've got a license
to steal from the general public...

990
01:07:28,667 --> 01:07:31,375
all legal and aboveboard,
but is that enough?

991
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:34,208
Fuck, no! They gotta
steal from their friends!

992
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,083
Anybody
but a fucking lawyer...

993
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:42,125
would consider
the consequences, right?

994
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:45,708
That I would,
for an absolute certainty...

995
01:07:45,792 --> 01:07:49,292
castrate that son of a bitch
with a butter knife.

996
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:52,625
And that would give
a normal person pause.

997
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:54,583
But not a lawyer.

998
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:58,500
It defies the imagination,
you know.

999
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:03,958
How a woman like you could throw
in with a couple of farthammers...

1000
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:06,042
like Cavanaugh and Arglist.

1001
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,708
Cavanaugh, he doesn't
have the brains...

1002
01:08:09,792 --> 01:08:11,250
to pull off
something like this.

1003
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:13,917
And Arglist,
he doesn't have the guts.

1004
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:17,792
Maybe that's where you
came in, huh?

1005
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,833
What did you do?

1006
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:28,292
Did you encourage them both?

1007
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,167
Suppose you do luck out...

1008
01:08:43,167 --> 01:08:46,542
and you get clear of Wichita
with all that money.

1009
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:47,792
At some point...

1010
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:51,333
you're gonna have to get rid of
at least one of the peckerwoods.

1011
01:08:51,417 --> 01:08:53,042
And then what do you got?

1012
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:56,625
A dick with no brain?

1013
01:08:57,292 --> 01:08:59,250
Or a brain with no dick?

1014
01:09:05,917 --> 01:09:07,667
You know what, Bill?

1015
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:10,167
You seem awfully tense.

1016
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:15,167
And I have this idea
of what might help you relax.

1017
01:09:17,917 --> 01:09:18,917
You do, huh?

1018
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,958
Mmm-hmm.

1019
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:34,375
That you, Arglist?

1020
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:37,083
Drop the gun.

1021
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:41,042
Step away from the desk
and put your hands up.

1022
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:43,875
Charlie,
don't be a fucking idiot.

1023
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:47,292
You've been watching
too many stupid old movies.

1024
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:49,167
Why would I drop my gun?

1025
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:50,958
I don't know, Bill.

1026
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:52,542
Because I got
a big fucking shotgun...

1027
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:53,708
and I'll blow your head off?

1028
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:56,042
Well, if you could do that,
you'd be me...

1029
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,500
and I'd be a pissant lawyer
with a case of the shakes.

1030
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:00,750
Jesus, Charlie,
just shoot him!

1031
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:05,917
If he was gonna
pull the trigger...

1032
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:08,458
he'd have done it when he came
through the door, girlie.

1033
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:10,708
It's something they don't
teach you in law school.

1034
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,500
Which is a shame,
because...

1035
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:24,333
Get his gun, Charlie.

1036
01:10:26,292 --> 01:10:27,708
Get his gun.

1037
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:29,750
He's dead, Renata.

1038
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:32,542
The fuck he is! Sidney
loads that with birdshot!

1039
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:34,000
Why would he? I mean...
Charlie.

1040
01:10:34,042 --> 01:10:36,708
...from a liability standpoint,
that doesn't make any sense at all.

1041
01:10:36,792 --> 01:10:37,875
Charlie!

1042
01:10:41,917 --> 01:10:43,500
Well, Arglist...

1043
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:46,542
now you've truly gone
and shit in your nest!

1044
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:53,458
All right, girlie.
You first.

1045
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:54,750
Mr. Guerrard?

1046
01:10:56,667 --> 01:10:57,833
What's going on?

1047
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,042
Come here!

1048
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,042
Bitch!

1049
01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:28,542
Charlie.

1050
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:33,958
I don't know why
I even bother with Kansas.

1051
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:35,833
Do I hear an "amen"?

1052
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:39,875
My old man tried
to tell me...

1053
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:42,583
that I'd be better off
starting a church...

1054
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:45,292
and letting Jesus pay
for the mortgage...

1055
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:49,083
in this sorry-ass
backwards state.

1056
01:11:50,042 --> 01:11:51,375
I wouldn't listen.

1057
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,083
Instead...

1058
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:57,417
I put my faith
in naked women and hand jobs.

1059
01:11:57,542 --> 01:12:01,125
Which have a proven track
record everywhere but here.

1060
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:10,042
And now I've been disfigured
by a whisky-dick lawyer...

1061
01:12:11,042 --> 01:12:14,708
who imagines he can kill me
with a shotgun loaded for snake.

1062
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,708
Serves me right.

1063
01:12:19,542 --> 01:12:20,917
That's all I can say.

1064
01:12:24,167 --> 01:12:25,875
All right, girlie...

1065
01:12:25,917 --> 01:12:28,500
this is the one
that's gonna kill you.

1066
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:30,958
Bill.

1067
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:43,542
Yuck!

1068
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:02,500
I will say, after this...

1069
01:13:02,542 --> 01:13:05,750
the holidays are never gonna
feel quite the same to me.

1070
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:11,625
How's the foot?
Shorter.

1071
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:14,958
You don't happen to have
any morphine...

1072
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,792
or Demerol or anything,
do you?

1073
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:19,042
Try this.

1074
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,458
I have to give you credit,
Charlie.

1075
01:13:27,042 --> 01:13:30,417
You took your own sweet time
rising to the occasion...

1076
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:33,792
but in the end,
you did the deed.

1077
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:37,125
'Deed you did.

1078
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:47,583
You really came through,
Charlie.

1079
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:51,708
The odds were definitely
against it, but somehow...

1080
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:54,583
you managed to be
the last man standing.

1081
01:14:37,417 --> 01:14:39,000
I know what I wanted
to ask you.

1082
01:14:41,292 --> 01:14:43,792
What?
Where are you actually from?

1083
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:45,750
Originally.

1084
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,250
Why do you keep
asking questions, Charlie?

1085
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:53,500
What's it got to do
with anything?

1086
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:57,625
I was just curious.

1087
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:01,417
Wanted to know
where you came from.

1088
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:18,125
It's a long story,
Charlie.

1089
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:22,042
I think we've got plenty of time
to get to know each other better.

1090
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:24,958
Don't you?
Yeah.

1091
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:27,208
I guess we do.

1092
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:29,625
It's just you and me now,
Charlie.

1093
01:15:34,417 --> 01:15:36,500
To the victor go the spoils.

1094
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,667
You saved my life,
Charlie.

1095
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:53,083
You're a different man,
just like I promised.

1096
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:57,417
Can you feel it?

1097
01:15:59,042 --> 01:16:01,625
Yes. I can.

1098
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:07,375
Charlie.

1099
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:12,333
What'd you do?

1100
01:17:21,042 --> 01:17:24,167
Oh! Damn stupid fuck!

1101
01:17:24,792 --> 01:17:27,208
You stupid fucking whore!

1102
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:30,625
You dumb, dumb fuck!

1103
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:32,625
Your mother again?
Shit!

1104
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:36,542
Hi, Charlie. Yeah.
Who else?

1105
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:41,625
Loans me her camper and fails
to mention that it's out of gas.

1106
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:45,125
If you've got a gas can,
you can siphon some from me.

1107
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:17,458
Charlie.

1108
01:18:18,917 --> 01:18:21,208
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way...

1109
01:18:23,542 --> 01:18:27,375
but you're about
the nicest guy I know.

1110
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:32,792
I'm awfully sorry to hear
that, Sidney, but thank you.

1111
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:36,458
Have a good time
with your kids at Six Flags.

1112
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:39,542
Merry Christmas.

1113
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:27,167
Nuts! Fuck!

1114
01:19:33,417 --> 01:19:34,875
What was that?

1115
01:19:36,375 --> 01:19:37,375
Nothing.

1116
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:17,000
Morning, Pete. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1117
01:20:19,583 --> 01:20:21,000
Where are we?

1118
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:23,208
We're in heaven.

1119
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:25,625
Mmm.

1120
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:31,708
They got pancakes?
They got everything.

1121
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:33,458
Good.
