1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,694
Yeah, she pulls me
into this tiny-ass bathroom.

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,237
She's all, "Climb up on the sink."

3
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,114
I'm like, "It's a dirty-ass sink."

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,033
And she says, "You're fuckin' dirty."

5
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,618
So I climb up on that sink, my boy,

6
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,703
you know what I'm sayin'?
Then she gets on top of me right away

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,538
and starts riding me all crazy, fool.

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,166
And it was scary 'cause the sink
was all small and slippery and old.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,918
But I grabbed it like that
and she started riding me

10
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,142
and I'm all trying to mack her
at the same time, like...

11
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,298
And the sink starts, like,
creaking and cracking

12
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,883
so I got scared, homey.

13
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,009
But did I tell her to stop?

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,159
Hell, no.

15
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,388
Look at you. Not even paying attention.

16
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,474
You're just swiping your life away, homey.

17
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,435
Hey, dawg, I told you,
me and Maggie are done for real this time.

18
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,437
I'm trying to put myself out there.

19
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,523
You're not the only fool
that wants to fuck on a sink.

20
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,484
You don't need the Internet
to find a lady. Alright?

21
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,051
The streets are my Internet, homeboy.

22
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:53,136
Check it out.

23
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,681
Damn, mija, you Jewish?

24
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,035
Well, shalom to you too.

25
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,663
Hey, fool, I don't think they like
that catcalling shit anymore.

26
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,289
You trying to speak for all women?

27
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,499
It's a numbers game, my boy.

28
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,775
Calculations. Watch.
Check this out, playboy.

29
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,403
Hey!

30
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,297
Damn.

31
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,574
No, we don't know each other,
but we're about to.

32
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,579
Damn, mija.

33
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,268
Eventually they'll bite, homey.

34
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,978
But even if they don't,
they're still flattered.

35
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,763
Hey, what's up, girl? You wanna
run away with me and start a new life?

36
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,816
I'm just kidding. I don't wanna leave LA.

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,942
What are you talkin' about?

38
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,027
Boo, hey, do you drink?

39
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,738
Because after a few,
I start looking like Mario Lopez.

40
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,073
Hey, this is my son right here.

41
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,284
He has that fucked-up disease
where he looks all old and shit.

42
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,285
Help me raise him.

43
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,686
Another trip, homey,
you can't just put yourself out there.

44
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,831
'Cause they'll break your heart like that.

45
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:45,999
I mean, you know what I mean?

46
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,858
But it'd be cool to find love though.

47
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,878
Hey, what's up, girl,
you got a library card?

48
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,754
Damn, girl, you got a library card?

49
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,131
Hey, girl, you got a library card?

50
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,824
You can check me out for as long
as you want, no late fees, mija.

51
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,535
I just got her number.
She's right over there.

52
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,639
Damn, girl, you're so fine
that even if you cheated on me,

53
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,748
I wouldn't be mad.

54
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,042
Actually, I'd be heartbroken.

55
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,542
That's fucked up.
Why would you even do that to me?

56
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,633
Got four numbers, my boy.

57
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,319
That's it?

58
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,761
You bothered like 30 women.

59
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,597
- Oh, really?
- How many numbers did you get?

60
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,307
I got a date lined up.

61
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,226
Exactly. One date.

62
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,217
- You ready to go or what?
- No, I haven't even eaten yet.

63
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,001
Oh, hey, but you know what?

64
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,253
I forgot to tell you about this
one jaina I was dating, right?

65
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,963
She was a bodybuilder, homey.

66
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,882
And, uh, she would give me
piggyback rides around in her pad

67
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,258
and we both'd be naked.

68
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,082
But then I found out
she was using steroids...

69
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,781
This is all your shit
you left at my house.

70
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,867
- Wow. Bringing my stuff over.
- What a drama queen.

71
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,494
Did you see this in a movie?

72
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,205
- Can you just take this shit? It's heavy.
- Ay, pobrecito.

73
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,109
You need me to save you
from the big, scary box?

74
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,067
Ew.

75
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,695
That's your book, not mine, loser.

76
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,756
Yeah. You should read it, though.

77
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,050
This is all 'cause you want
an excuse to see me, huh?

78
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,826
I'm not staying. I gotta get to work.

79
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,597
Damn, Maggie, did you have
people over last night?

80
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,307
Why are there so many dishes?

81
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,292
Don't worry about it. I'll do 'em later.

82
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,421
So how broken up are we this time?

83
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,423
I'm on Tinder.

84
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,568
That's how broken up we are.

85
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:37,926
Oh, shit. Damn.

86
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,847
- Well, let me see your profile, then.
- Nope.

87
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,724
Fine.

88
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,893
I don't wanna see it anyways.

89
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,830
Just kidding.

90
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,564
Maggie. Stop fuckin' around.

91
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,377
You enjoy the world's cuisine?

92
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,671
- Shut the fuck up.
- Who are you, Anthony Bourdain?

93
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,715
- Bitch, I could be.
- I've eaten "foy gray" before.

94
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,718
Bitch, you don't even know
how to pronounce "foy gray."

95
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,012
- Give me that.
- Hobbies: Hiking?

96
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,704
Since when?

97
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:09,100
I'm gonna change it to
hate-washing your ex's dishes

98
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,102
'cause you secretly
can't get enough of her.

99
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,006
Stop fuckin' around
and give me back my phone.

100
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,881
Fine.

101
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,692
Go ahead.

102
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,468
Pretend to be someone you're not, faker.

103
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,572
Good luck finding anyone to date
with that lame-ass profile.

104
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,097
Already got a date lined up.

105
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,933
Jealous?

106
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,203
No. I'm happy for you.

107
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,704
Invite me to the wedding.

108
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,248
I'll walk you down the aisle
and then I'll hook up with her dad.

109
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,152
I'm gonna be your mommy-in-law.

110
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,196
- Julio!
- Maggie!

111
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,426
Readjusting to life outside of prison

112
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,869
can be an alienating experience.

113
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,790
In order to move forward,
you need to push past the fear.

114
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,961
You need to try to form
meaningful connections.

115
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,941
Did anybody make
any meaningful connections this week

116
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,216
they'd like to talk about?

117
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,576
Hey, minister, your boy smashed,
homey, like a lot.

118
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,160
You know what I'm sayin'?
I was all upside down and shit, like...

119
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,773
It was all some
Cirque du Soleil shit, homey.

120
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,484
Oh, what, you're jealous?

121
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,462
You should hit the calles
with me next time, fool.

122
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,926
There's all kinds of jainas out there
looking to get bothered.

123
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,967
I'm glad you got to smash, Luis.

124
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,343
Thank you, Dr. Payne.

125
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,785
Give me a high five.

126
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,516
It must be nice to have
some emotional intimacy

127
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,892
after getting out of prison.

128
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,228
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- I love me some emotional Timothy.

129
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,981
You know, I spent, what,
eight calendars locked up, you know,

130
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,899
and before that I was engaged for two.

131
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,026
So it's been ten years
since I was able to roam free.

132
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,570
You were engaged when you went in?

133
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:44,678
That's heavy, bro.

134
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,055
She visit you in prison?

135
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,576
Nope.

136
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,702
Not even once.

137
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,871
- That's cold.
- I don't know.

138
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,747
I don't even think about that skonka.

139
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,583
Damn.
How could you not think about someone

140
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,085
that played a significant part
in your life, bro?

141
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,004
That's a red flag, motherfucker.

142
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,797
Well, I think what they're getting at

143
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,175
is there's often this desire
to move forward

144
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,843
without examining the past.

145
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,220
But we need closure,

146
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,306
or else we can get bogged down
by resentment.

147
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,307
Well, I got resentment.

148
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,474
She still has the ring that I got her.

149
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,684
I spent three racks on that thing.

150
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,519
You need closure, homey.

151
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,979
This ain't about no ring.

152
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,939
Whoa, whoa. Wait a second here. No.

153
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,483
Luis might be right.

154
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:25,177
That ring could be a symbol of closure.

155
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:29,115
Maybe you need to go talk
through your issues with your ex, Luis,

156
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,992
and get that ring back.

157
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,410
I do deserve that ring.

158
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,245
I could use that feria.

159
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,469
You know, doing it upside down
all the time ain't cheap.

160
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,317
Hey, uh, Luis.

161
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,340
Um, you're not thinking about
going to talk to your ex alone, are you?

162
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,884
Because in situations like these,

163
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,677
emotions can run really high

164
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,537
and get in the way
of constructive dialogue.

165
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,872
I can help you get the ring back.

166
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,643
Once upon a time
I used to manage a strip club,

167
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,145
so this will be a cakewalk
compared to that.

168
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,839
Damn. What kinda doctor
manages a strip club?

169
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:07,219
Luis, I have square danced in towns
you've never even heard of.

170
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,657
Also, I'm not a doctor. I'm a minister.

171
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,224
Alright, then, fuck it, Dr. Payne.

172
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,060
Actually, it'd be kinda tight
if you roll with me.

173
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,497
And, you know, you could be
a witness if she tries to kill me.

174
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,147
Yeah. Yeah, right.

175
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,191
No, I'm serious.

176
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,154
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.

177
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,508
There was a lot of traffic to get here.

178
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,301
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I hope it wasn't too stressful.

179
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,286
- Oh, that 10, man.
- Don't fuck around.

180
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,683
I hope it's okay that I picked vegan.

181
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,851
I know it's not for everyone.

182
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,853
- Oh, don't worry.
- I eat this shit all the time.

183
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:40,854
- For real?
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,523
Me too. All my exes hated eating vegan.

185
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,548
Hmm.

186
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,985
You're not still close to your exes,
are you?

187
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,570
No. I mean, I wish them all the best,

188
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,197
but I do not believe
in staying friends with exes.

189
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,389
I could not agree more.

190
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,601
Like I've always said,
when it's over, it's over.

191
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,080
Part of the reason I picked this place

192
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,480
is because my friend's the owner.

193
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,400
I should introduce you.
She's an entrepreneur too.

194
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,379
A what?

195
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,947
Your profile. You said you were
an aspiring entrepreneur.

196
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,342
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.
- Yeah.

197
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,036
Like I've always said, be your own boss.

198
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,495
Wow.

199
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,348
You live by a lot of phrases.

200
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,373
Mm-hmm.

201
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,667
Uh, so what business do you wanna start?

202
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,836
Oh, well, um...

203
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,485
Uh, well... I have a passion for coffee.

204
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,028
Oh, so you wanna
open your own coffee shop?

205
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,863
Yeah. That's exactly what I wanna do.

206
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,364
- Yeah?
- Damn, mind reader.

207
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,491
That's so cool.

208
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,243
Maybe you can hire
some of the ex-cons you work with.

209
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,287
It's like you're reading
my business plan.

210
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,872
That's so great.

211
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,333
None of my exes had ambition.
They were all talk.

212
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,943
Hey, if you're gonna talk that talk,
better walk that walk.

213
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,736
Okay.

214
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,753
So tell me all about this business plan.

215
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,407
Well, it's, I guess you would...

216
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,140
- I gotta take this.
- Oh.

217
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,416
Uh, it's one of the gang members
I helped reform.

218
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,978
Kinda like a mentor to them, you know.

219
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,271
Yeah.

220
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,296
So sweet.

221
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,899
Maggie, what do you want?

222
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,026
Julio, I got a rabbit
and now I can't find the rabbit,

223
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,236
and I'm fuckin' freaking out.

224
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,654
When the fuck did you get a rabbit?

225
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:13,780
Today.

226
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,449
When I got in my car to go to run errands
he was just sitting on the windshield

227
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,284
and he looked so cute and perfect.

228
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,435
I decided to take him in,
but now he's missing.

229
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,247
Are you tryin' to fuck up my date?

230
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,414
Oh, shit.

231
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,166
- Your date's tonight? No.
- Yeah.

232
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,378
- I didn't know. You know what?
- Forget it. I'll get someone else.

233
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,214
- No, fuck it. I'm coming over.
- Clearly you need me.

234
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,323
- Again.
- No, I don't n...

235
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,718
- I'm sorry, but I have to go.
- It's an emergency.

236
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,761
Oh, wow...

237
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,055
But you know what,
let me pay for dinner.

238
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,890
I'm so sorry. Is everything okay?

239
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,600
- Oh, yeah, yeah, totally.
- Everything's totally fine.

240
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,834
But it's an emergency?

241
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,896
- Oh, right, yeah.
- Big-ass emergency.

242
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,690
- But don't worry about it.
- Okay. I'm sorry.

243
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,883
Um, do you want the food to go?

244
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,362
Oh, no. You know what?

245
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,055
As I always say,
give the leftovers to the staff.

246
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:58,741
Never heard that one before.

247
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,368
- Feel free to use it.
- Okay.

248
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,102
- I gotta go. I'll call you.
- Alright.

249
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,169
I'm so fuckin' nervous.

250
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,920
Oh, you're gonna be great.

251
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,255
There's nothing to worry about.

252
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,966
We're just gonna have
a mature conversation

253
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,159
that ends with you getting your ring back.

254
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,786
Yeah, yeah. Right, right.

255
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,764
- Mature?
- Yeah.

256
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,248
No problem.

257
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,794
- I can't do this shit.
- Hey, Luis.

258
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,149
Get back here.
We gotta talk to her together.

259
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,234
- Hey, you talk to her!
- You're the one that told me about closure.

260
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,698
I didn't even know what that shit was
till you said that shit.

261
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,655
Hi.

262
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,240
Who the fuck are you
and what the fuck do you want?

263
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,325
Hello, I'm sorry to bother you.

264
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,452
- Oh, I know who you are.
- So sorry, sir,

265
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,579
but we don't believe
in that magic underwear shit.

266
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,039
Oh, no, no, no.

267
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,040
I'm not a Mormon.

268
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:50,293
I wish. Uh, my name is Leonard Payne.

269
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:54,631
Um, this may sound a little weird,
but do you know Luis Hernandez?

270
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,924
That fuckin' asshole?

271
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:58,259
Whatever he's being charged with,
he did that shit.

272
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,886
I'd be happy to testify in court.

273
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,596
Well, actually, I'm here bec...

274
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,348
Hey, hey. You're the fuckin' asshole.

275
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,642
Oh, my God! I should've fucking known!

276
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,020
Luis, you're still the same
coward piece of shit you've always been.

277
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,815
Hiding in the bushes
like the scared little bitch you are.

278
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,775
- I wasn't hiding.
- I was taking a leak.

279
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,342
Pissing in the streets like a rat!

280
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,405
- As I was saying, I run a nonprofit.
- It's called Hugs Not Thugs.

281
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,324
And we rehabilitate ex-gang members.

282
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:25,495
Now, Luis, he's been doing
a lot of hard work on himself,

283
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,731
and I think it could help you both
find some closure if you talk things out.

284
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,777
I'll talk things out with you.

285
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,173
You're a fuckin' loser with a weird dick.

286
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,300
Hey, fuck you. Curvy dicks are normal!

287
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,678
- And I want my ring back.
- You're not helping.

288
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,805
Hey, if you don't give me that ring
back, I'm gonna sue your ass

289
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,515
and you know Judge Judy
will rule in my favor.

290
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,933
Her show is over now, idiot.

291
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,518
Yeah, well, she's got
a new one now, idiot.

292
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,270
Oh, yeah? What time? I wanna watch!

293
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,212
It's streaming
so it's available whenever.

294
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:53,755
Stupid.

295
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,903
- You got a fuckin' rabbit?
- Yeah, I got a fuckin' rabbit.

296
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,013
I told you not to come.

297
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,866
I know when I'm needed.

298
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,660
Well, I already checked everywhere,
so I don't need you anymore.

299
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,454
I didn't leave my perfect date
to not find your rabbit.

300
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,272
Okay, psycho.

301
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,126
By the way, I got Wendy's
if you're hungry.

302
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,377
I don't wanna eat that garbage.

303
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,380
I just ate a delicious-ass vegan meal.
I'm stuffed.

304
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,615
You ate healthy to impress your date?

305
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,051
Ah, no mames, güey.

306
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,578
- You're so pathetic.
- Let's just find this fuckin' rabbit.

307
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:27,056
I checked there.

308
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,099
Oh, come on!

309
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,602
No, you cheated on me
with all my home girls.

310
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:31,978
You made my life hell.

311
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,814
And then you got yourself locked up
for doing some dumb shit.

312
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,900
So, yeah, I'm still fuckin' angry.

313
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,610
Wah, wah, wah, pura pinche novel a!

314
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,403
Alright? Don't act like
you cared about me.

315
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,863
You never even came to visit me once.

316
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,948
Enough, Luis, shut the fuck up.

317
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,326
You know what? I'm partially to blame.

318
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,454
This is what I get
for messin' with someone shorter than me.

319
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,039
Short guys are fuckin' evil.

320
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,499
Five-six is an average height.

321
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,900
- You're five-foot-five at best.
- Now go back to your bush.

322
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,485
Okay, fine, whatever.

323
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,403
Hell.

324
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,593
Vanessa, tell me
what is really going on here

325
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:04,743
for you with this ring?

326
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,123
I keep it as a reminder
of the stupid mistake I made

327
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,601
with that fuckin' idiot.

328
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:15,045
Why would you want a reminder
of him being an idiot?

329
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,756
Listen, between you and me,

330
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,276
I don't think he's gonna
make it through the program.

331
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,028
I've worked with a lot of these guys.

332
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,513
Luis... he's definitely
going back to prison.

333
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:29,285
But you giving back the ring
is not just about his closure,

334
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,662
it's also about yours.

335
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:34,022
Don't you wanna free yourself
from this short loser forever?

336
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,152
Okay.

337
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,072
But only if he lets me
kick him in the balls.

338
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,909
- How's that now?
- That asshole fucked me over.

339
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,472
And I've been waiting eight years
to kick him in the fuckin' balls.

340
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,081
If you really want the ring,

341
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,669
Luis' nuts are getting fuckin' rocked.

342
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,050
Let me see what I can do.

343
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,112
No fuckin' way.

344
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,948
Okay, think of it
as an opportunity for growth.

345
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,741
Enough with
the fucking short jokes, okay?

346
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,311
- Hey, Luis, trust me.
- I'm a doctor, remember?

347
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,165
This will be
a physical reminder of closure.

348
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,959
It's like a string
that you wrap around your finger, right?

349
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,086
Only it's a kick in the huevos.

350
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,338
There's future little Luises
swimming around in there,

351
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,465
and I don't want my kids
coming out all weird and shit.

352
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,450
Do you want the ring back or not?

353
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,120
Fuck!

354
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,847
Fuck!

355
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,082
That felt good!

356
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,567
Alright, then, your turn, Grandpa.

357
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,087
- What?
- You came here

358
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,422
backing that piece of shit up.

359
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,508
So you also gotta get kicked in the balls.

360
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,677
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- That was not part of the deal.

361
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,261
I guess you don't want the ring back.

362
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:12,788
Come on, Payne.

363
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:14,665
You said you had my back.

364
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,461
Thanks for that.

365
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,005
I didn't realize how much I needed it.

366
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,675
I really must have hurt you
for you to kick me in the nuts like that.

367
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,468
Yeah, you did.

368
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,869
But I fucked up too.

369
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,013
Maybe I should have wrote you back.

370
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,082
Uh, yeah, well,
I'm sorry for my part in everything.

371
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,820
You don't belong with
a fuckin' knucklehead like me anyway.

372
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,754
It's all good, Luis.

373
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,215
Here.

374
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:10,220
Now, both of you take your broken nuts
and get the fuck off my lawn!

375
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,018
Take care.

376
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,153
Well, it's not under your bed.

377
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,532
Jesus, Maggie. I can't believe
a paralegal is this messy.

378
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,951
Whoo, I'd hate to see your desk.

379
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,829
I'm a rabbit murderer.

380
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:40,727
I can't even keep a rabbit alive.
How am I gonna have kids?

381
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,793
Hey, come on.

382
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:43,897
Invest in leashes.

383
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,899
Oh, I'm serious.

384
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,358
Me too. Leashes are great.

385
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,302
You can tie your kids up to a bike rack
while you go shopping.

386
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,740
Come on. We're gonna find him.

387
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,349
I wish I believed you.

388
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,562
- What was that?
- It's Roger.

389
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,582
Where the fuck is he?

390
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,959
Wait, you named him Roger
like Roger the Rabbit?

391
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,044
Ugh. So fuckin' original.

392
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,879
I named him after my neighbor Roger.

393
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,321
Oh, that Roger.

394
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,031
- I like that Roger.
- Shh.

395
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,345
He's inside the couch.

396
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,805
How the fuck would
a rabbit get inside the couch?

397
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,349
I don't know, they can get anywhere.

398
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,560
It doesn't sound like a rabbit.

399
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,584
How the fuck do you know
what rabbits sound like?

400
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,049
Fuck.

401
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,676
Oh, fuck.

402
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,487
The sound stopped.

403
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,054
Oh, my God. Fuck.

404
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,306
Oh, fuck! Roger's suffocating!

405
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,183
We gotta get him out right now!

406
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,770
Maggie, what the fuck are you doing?

407
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,290
Maggie, what the fuck?

408
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,482
No, Maggie, wait, no.

409
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,168
Maggie!

410
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,193
Maggie, wait.

411
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,132
Maggie, what the fuck?
You could have killed that little fool!

412
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,592
Help me then!

413
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,826
Alright.

414
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,695
Fuck!

415
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:14,970
Wrong rabbit.

416
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,934
It's a big-ass diamond.

417
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,688
We both went through a lot for this,
so don't try and fuck us.

418
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,388
I'll be back with the number.

419
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:35,091
Hey, uh, you know,
I don't mean to be forward or anything,

420
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,783
but after all we went through,

421
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,994
I'm wondering if you'd consider

422
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,682
compensating your old pal
for all the hard work he did today.

423
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,642
Wait, wait, wait,
that's what this is all about?

424
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,685
You just wanna get paid?

425
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:46,936
No, that's not what this is all about,

426
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,857
but I'm pretty sure I forfeited my ability
to be a father for you, okay?

427
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,193
I mean, she must've
played soccer or some shit

428
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,487
because one of my nuts
went so far up there

429
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:56,779
it ain't gonna be coming down
anytime soon.

430
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,764
Alright. Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's cool.

431
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,892
- You did get your nuts rocked.
- Very rocked.

432
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,188
- I'll give you half.
- Half?

433
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:08,982
Yeah, bro.

434
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:12,045
That is very, very,
very kind and generous.

435
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:13,070
Thank you very much.

436
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,409
Cubic zirconia.

437
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,330
- How's that now?
- Ain't worth shit.

438
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,749
Ain't worth shit? Are you...

439
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,645
Are you telling me
we went through all that shit

440
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,230
for cubic fuckin' zirconia?

441
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,439
Hey, hey, calm down, Payne.

442
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:32,899
My homey must've cheated me.

443
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,442
Okay, then let's go get your boy.

444
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,319
That's three racks we're talking about.

445
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,029
Yeah, there's only
one problem with that.

446
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,263
That fool's locked up.

447
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,139
For fraud.

448
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:43,910
Damn.

449
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,602
Guess I should've seen that coming, huh?

450
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:48,939
Fuck me!

451
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,501
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck me!

452
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,151
Motherfucker!

453
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,502
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey, hey, hey, Payne.

454
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,156
Hey. What the fuck's going on with you?

455
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,554
It's just...

456
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:04,013
Oh, man.

457
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:08,101
I'm just, I'm in this very
messed-up situation with my landlord

458
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,710
who doesn't understand

459
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,337
sometimes the rent's
gonna be fuckin' late.

460
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,048
Because I run a nonprofit!

461
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:18,862
If I can give you
one piece of advice, this is it:

462
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:20,637
Never divorce your landlord.

463
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,306
Damn.

464
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:25,618
And all this time you were talking to me
about how I need all this closure

465
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,037
but you're the one living in an apartment
owned by your ex-wife?

466
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,873
That's a red flag, motherfucker.

467
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:33,293
Yeah, well, you need to think of me
more as a cautionary tale

468
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:34,610
than a role model.

469
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:36,796
Okay, I see you, Payne.

470
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,756
And you know what,
actually, I have an idea

471
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,780
that could help you
with your little money problem.

472
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,286
Hey.

473
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,038
We're gonna take this instead.

474
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,356
This shit really works?

475
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,151
Yeah, I used to do it all the time
before I got locked up.

476
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,694
You know, if your window
or door is smashed

477
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,696
you don't gotta pay rent
till your landlord fixes it.

478
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,305
I barely ever paid rent.

479
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,867
It's California Civil Code, my boy.

480
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:09,370
- Well, thank you, Luis.
- I really appreciate it.

481
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,396
Dawg, I'm all about renters' rights.

482
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,106
Know what I'm sayin'?

483
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:16,002
Ooh. Fuck the landlords.

484
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,027
Fuck the landlord.

485
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,071
Hey, I think you got it. Chill.

486
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:27,472
So... did you give your date the chorizo

487
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,498
or was she not into that
because she's vegan?

488
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,418
Well, she liked my coffee shop idea.

489
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,605
What coffee shop idea?

490
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:39,150
You know how I've always dreamed
about opening up my own coffee shop?

491
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:42,111
- Bullshit.
- You've literally never mentioned that.

492
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,363
Well, you've never asked.

493
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,864
Dude, we're not on a first date.

494
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,075
Don't pretend like you're a real adult
with life goals and shit.

495
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:48,100
Okay, Maggie.

496
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,227
I'll stop pretending if you stop.

497
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:52,872
What do you mean?

498
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:56,024
You find out I'm going out on a date
with a woman who isn't you,

499
00:21:56,441 --> 00:22:01,822
and then you find a rabbit
who suddenly disappears.

500
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,574
Roger, where are you? Roger?

501
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:06,910
Come on. I just have to ask,

502
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,162
am I the rabbit?

503
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:11,891
You think I made this shit up?

504
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,917
I'm flattered. Really, I am.

505
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:15,669
It's hard to let go,

506
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,881
but you just have to let me...

507
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:22,902
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

508
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:23,927
...hop away.

509
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:26,698
Get the fuck out!

510
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:27,907
Now!

511
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,784
Maggie, it's okay. I know I'm a catch.

512
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,870
I don't want to get back together!

513
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:34,622
There is a rabbit somewhere
in this apartment

514
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,023
that might be dead.

515
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:38,192
