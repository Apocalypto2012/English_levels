More coffee, honey?

9
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,000

Look, almost goosebumps.

[in English] So bland.

19
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,875
Could at least you force two of them
to fight to the death or something?

20
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,916
Isn't it maybe about time
you bought an arena for death matches?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,625
I actually got an appraisal
for a death-match arena last year,

22
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:20,375
but it was so expensive,
so it... it just wasn't worth it.

23
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:23,083
That is a heap of bull crap,
and you know it.

24
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,541
No, no! You see, it's not just
to brick up a small coliseum.

25
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:31,166
You... You actually have to have
all the infrastructure in place.

26
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,625
And restrooms and wardrobes

27
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,500

Where are the exotic people?
Where's all the fun?

39
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,458
This is like an animal zoo with just cows.

40
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,125
Just be patient, my poppet.

41
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:17,125
I have a surprise in store for you.
A little gift.

42
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,291
Huh?

43
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,375
It's not something affordable, is it?

44
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,916
You remember that time
you bought me that affordable gift,

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,916
and you said
it was the thought that counts?

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,208
Yeah. How can I forget? You raised hell.

47
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,375
You were like a rabid dog with roid rage.

48
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,142
- Worst week of my life.
- [didgeridoo plays]

49
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,708
Yes, and with good reason.

50
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:41,416
So no, I promise you, it's not affordable.
It's really expensive this time.

51
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,166
I broke the bank on this one.

52
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,916
Oh, I hoped you'd step your game up.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,083
What you said right there
got my syrups flowing.

54
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,541
Uh, oh, oh, yeah?

55
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:56,000
Quick. Let's find a place to copulate.
It is a WAP bonanza in my panties.

Wh... Wh... What?

57
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,500
Let me have some of that D real fast.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm ready for a real jackhammering.

Maneuvering her

Yeah, you... you think so?

69

Oh yes. You have something special in you.

70
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,458
You know, I have never seen a captain
just blossom

71
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,958
and take control as fast as you.

72
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,041
Oh! [chuckles]

73
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,541
Wow, thank you.

74
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:04,416
I... I'm serious.
I must admit that I respect you so much

75
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,083
for not getting caught up
in that accident we had in Rio.

76
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,916
I know many people would, but not you.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,875
No, sir.

78
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,875
You are too strong in here,
and I can see that.

79
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,541
Maybe I am. Yeah.

80
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,166
Anyway, Mr. Tyrant wants to speak to you
in the conference room.

81
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,250
What? He's here? On the ship?

82
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,333
Uh, no, no, no. On a video link.

83
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,791
Oh. Wow. Mm! High tech. [chuckles]

84
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,875
Uh, Nico, you have the bridge.
Keep her steady.

85
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,708
The ship is anchored.

86
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,541
You want me to just stand here
and hold the wheel?

87
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,291
Yes, uh, just in case.

88
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:43,041
Or no. Or yes.

89
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,958
- Yes. Final answer, yes.
- Okay.

91
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,625
What is he like?

We've never met, so...

93

[Pedro] Oh. He's, eh... He's super nice.

Oh, no. No, no, no.

98
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,583
He wanted just you. His right hand.
The man in charge of everything.

Good afternoon, Mr. Tyrant.

<i>Am I on?</i>

106
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,875
<i>Is this thing on?</i>

107
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,333
Uh... Uh...

108
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,166
- I can...
<i>- Okay, tell me when I'm on.</i>

109
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,708
<i>Or use hand signals, you know?
More professional.</i>

110
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:10,500
I can both see and hear you, Mr. Tyrant.
Can you hear me?

111
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,083
<i>So he can't see me? Or can he?</i>

112
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,583
- I...
- [Tyrant] <i>Then just say "can't."</i>

113
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:24,458
<i>Yes, I know what the green light means.
I've done this many times before.</i>

114
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:28,250
<i>It means the camera is on.
I know this, but it doesn't seem to work.</i>

115
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:32,375
It works perfectly well on my end.
I... I can hear you loud and clear.

[Tyrant inhales, sighs]

<i>They said this system
was supposed to be robust, you know?</i>

119
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,125
<i>That's why I had it installed.</i>

120
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,000
Hello. Hello? Can you... Can you see me?

I've been expecting you.</i>

Good afternoon, Mr. Tyrant.
Wh... What an honor. Um...

131
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,250
I... I can't see your face real well.

132
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,041
It looks kinda like an aura of mystique
around you or something.

133
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,208
Maybe someone can adjust
the lights for you?

134
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,958
<i>Yeah, we'll... we'll see about that.</i>

135
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:32,458
<i>I just wanted to check in
and see that you've been settling in okay.</i>

136

<i>- I hear great things about you already.</i>
- You have?

137
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,541
<i>Yes! I'm so proud of you.</i>

138
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,541
<i>- You're my right-hand man. You know?</i>
- Yes, I know.

139
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:44,041
<i>And it is important
that you don't let anyone push you around.</i>

140
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,916
I won't. [chuckles]

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,875
Or wh... what do you mean exactly?

142
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:52,333
<i>Oh, for example, don't let anyone else
sign off on documents.</i>

143
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:56,750
<i>Everything that goes on and off the ship
should have your signature on it.</i>

144
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,125
Yeah, I'll make sure.

145
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,208
<i>And you are the star.</i>

146
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,666
<i>You should be in every photo
with prominent guests.</i>

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,708
<i>That's your perk.
Don't let anyone take that away from you.</i>

148

You bet. I will not let you down, sir.

149

<i>Good. Good luck, son.</i>

00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,166
Copy that.

171
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:22,625
Good morning, everyone.
I am so glad to see you all here.

172
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,500
Just relax
and follow my every instruction,

173
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:29,708
and you will find yourself
completely rejuvenated and peaceful.

174
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,416
Okay, let's get started.

175
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,833
[tablet beeps]

176
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,833
It's go time. Stand by.

177
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:40,250
Everybody lie down on your backs
and breathe, okay? Deep, deep breaths.

178
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:44,250
And close your eyes. Everyone now.

179
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,041
Deep, deep breaths.

180
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:51,083
In, out, in...

181
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,958
And... release the gas.

182
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,833
- Out.
- [gas hisses]

183
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,708
[passengers sigh]

184
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,458
[crunching]

185
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,708
[Nico mutters]

186
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,125
[Nico] Oh, crap. Sorry. My bad.

187
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:14,083
That was a little unfortunate. [chuckles]
A little unprofessional.

188
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,291
You are the one in charge? A female?

189
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,666
[chuckles] Mm-hmm.

190
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,541
Captain Fall isn't feeling well,
but he sends his regards.

191
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,125
Oh. Okay.

192
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,625
"Dear Jan, hope you like the Indian tribe

193
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,750
and that they will live
a long and happy life

194
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:44,208
in your human zoo.
All the best, Captain Fall." Here.

195
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,625
Good. So, this is so exciting, eh?

196
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:54,083
You know, my wife is
looking so much forward to the surprise.

197
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:58,250
I... really think it will take
my whole concept to a new level.

198
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,958
A great addition to my park.

199
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,791
Mm. Money first.

200
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,750
Yes, yes, of course. Hey.

201
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,125
[in Afrikaans] Money.

202
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,041
[tablet bleeps]

203
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,041
[mechanical whirring]

204
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,583
Wow.

205
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,875
<i>Magtag!</i>

206
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,583
They are beautiful.

207
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,250
So pure.

208
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,333
Jan, it would be a good idea
not to expose them

209
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,291
to any of our germs. Okay?

210
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:39,625
You know, them never having had contact
with other humans and so on and so forth.

211
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,958
Yes, yes, yes, of course.

212
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,708
[Liza] Enjoy.

213
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:05,125
[Pedro] Gas effect ceases
in three, two, one.

214
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,583
That's it.

215
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,500
Now come back to your conscious self.

216
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,666
Deep breaths.

217
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,708
Get as much oxygen
as you can into your lungs.

218
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:20,791
Humongous breaths now
to fill you with pure oxygen.

219
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,333
I think some of you
fell asleep there for a little while.

220
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,958
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

221
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:33,208
- Okay, two more times. In and out.
- [groans] Ah!

222
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,833
Slowly sit up. Let's bow our heads.

223
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:41,041
The light in me honors the light in you.

224
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,083
Namaste.

225
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,958
[Jonathan] Oh. Wow.

226
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,250
You are really good at yoga... thing.

227
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:53,083
- So limber. That was incredibly relaxing.
- Glad you enjoyed it.

228
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,083
Ah. Oh, my nose.

229
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,958
And my chin feels like
I was hit by a truck.

230
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,833
A very tiny truck, but...

231
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,625
I guess you fell over
when you fell asleep.

232
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,208
- Happens all the time.
- Ha-oh.

233
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:08,666
Yeah, listen.
I just wanted to touch base on, uh...

234
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,333
you know, the thing
that happened the other day.

235
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,375
- Which thing?
- You know, the... ejaculation thing.

236
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,083
Oh. That.

237
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,250
I just wanted you to know

238
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,458
that I still respect you
just as much as before.

239
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,708
Yeah. Sure, of course.

240
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:27,541
Yeah, and I am... I am mellow
about the whole experience.

241
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,625
No biggie.

242
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,791
[grunts, chuckles]

243
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,500
Of course, yeah. No biggie.

244
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,083
Yeah, let's just treat it
like what it was.

245
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:38,875
Two consenting adults
feeding off each other's... sexual energy?

246
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:39,791
Yup.

247
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,833
And this time I climax,
next time it could be you.

248
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:46,250
Those things are supposedly pretty random.

249
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,250
[Liza] Mm-hmm.

250
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,500
[inhales sharply] Hey, um, I've gotta run,
but I'll see you around, Captain.

251
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,958
Sure. Yes. I... I will be around,

252
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,458
uh, if you wanted
to experience that again,

253
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,041
or something in that nature...
We can circle back on it.

254
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh... What was I going to do?

255
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,666
- Oh yeah, this thing.
- [music starts, stops repeatedly]

256
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,750
[band playing jazz]

257
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,708
[chatter]

258
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,916
- Hello, toot-toot, testing.
- [speaker feeds back]

259
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:21,958
Testing.

260
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:26,666
Dear friends, dear family, dear Elizabeth.

261
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:32,666
As you may know, this human zoo was built
because of Elizabeth's big heart.

262
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:37,833
She cares so much for people.
She is a true xenophile

263
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:42,791
with so much interest and care
for foreign people's cultures and customs,

264
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,791
so give her a warm round of applause.

265
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,083
- Oh!
- [applause]

266
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,750
Thank you, Jan. [giggles] Thank you.

267
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:54,416
I wanted to buy her a gift
unlike anything she had before.

268
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,500
The most expensive
and rare gem in our collection.

269
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,125
Now let me introduce to you,
from the depths of the Amazon rainforest,

270
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:09,583
untouched by humans, they have lived
in total isolation for thousands of years.

271
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:15,458
They are among the last of their kind.
Meet the Javaruna Tribe!

272
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,250
[coughs]

273
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,833
- [Jan] What?
- [Elizabeth] Oh!

274
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:20,833
What? No!

275
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:21,916
[attendee 1] Disease!

276
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,375
They brought the plague!
The plague is upon us!

277
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,291
They're trying to kill us!
Everybody get out of here!

278
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,416
[commotion]

279
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,125
What the hell is this, Jan?
A disgrace! It's an utter disgrace!

280
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:38,166
I'm sorry. They said something
about the bad immune systems.

281
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,125
I don't know.

282
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:42,333
Idiot! You bought damaged merchandise.

283
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:47,291
This surprise sucks swollen balls,
and we have been made fools of.

284
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,041
- [attendee 2] Get out of my way!
- Oh! [whimpers]

285
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,333
[in Norwegian] Now!

286
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,601
The moment we have been waiting
for so many, many long years.

287
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,041
Implement the plan!

288
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,750
Oh, ah.

289
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,416
- [alarm rings]
- [Norwegian prisoner] Whoo!

290
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,333
[dramatic music plays]

291
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,500
[Bubba] This is our chance.

292
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,958
- We did it, Bubba!
- Oh my God!

293
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,916
- Americans are fucking free!
- Woo-hoo!

294
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,250
USA! USA! Fuckin'...

295
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,916
I'm coming home, baby!

296
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,208
- [alarm blaring]
- [commotion continues]

297
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,791
[gun firing darts]

298
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,250
[in Norwegian] Run, Johannes!
Run like the wind!

299
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,375
[woman, in English] This way!

300
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,375
Round them up! Capture everyone!

301
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,375
[Sue] Oh!

302
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
[screams]

303
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,291
[grunting]

304
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:48,041
[panting] Get the militia now!
I will revenge this!

305
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:52,291
No one makes a fool
of Jan Onthercaart von der Recht!

306
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,416
Sorry, did you say something, boss?
The alarm.

307
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,833
[muffled] I said get the militia now.

308
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,458
I will revenge this. No one makes a fool
of Jan Onthercaart von der Recht!

309
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,083
Get the militia?

310
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes, you... [imperceptible]

311
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,333
- That Captain Fall is going down!
- [alarm stops]

312
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,583
[panting, gasping]

313
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,125
- I can't do this, Jim.
- Just keep going, buddy.

314
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,125
This engine ain't built for exercise.

315
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:22,166
Come on, Bubba. You can do this.
Now we gotta haul ass. Come on.

316
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,625
No prison in the world is worse
than running like this.

317
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,333
Don't you turtle up on me now, Bubba.

318
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:32,208
Sorry, Jim.
I'm turtling up and hoping for the best.

319
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,958
Don't do this, Bubba.
We're in this together.

320
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:38,083
If you're turtling, shit, I'm turtling.

321
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,166
[Americans panting]

322
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,875
[crickets chirping]

323
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,166
Ah, this is so nice.

324
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,541
That sprint took everything I had in me.

325
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:55,291
Yeah. It's pretty nice.
I wonder what's for dinner.

326
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,250
[in Norwegian] I will expose
this horrible place,

327
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,750
even if it's the last thing I do.

328
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,958
Same here. That is exactly my plan too.

329
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,666
Seriously?
Maybe you can make your own plan?

330
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,250
You don't have to mimic everything I do.

331
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,666
Yeah, but it's pretty obvious
to have that plan

332
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,625
after sitting in a human zoo for 16 years.

333
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,500
Yes. You can do
what your conscience tells you,

334
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:28,291
but it's not very inventive
when you have the exact same plan as me.

335
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,791
Its just not very creative.

336
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,291
[gulls squawking]

337
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,125
Have a nice trek.

338
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,708
Okay. Have fun. Not too much fun!

339
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,831
[chuckles] No, it's okay.
You can have too much fun.

340
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,041
All right, see ya.

341
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,000
[clears throat, sighs]

342
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:47,666
Oh, so, Pedro, I was gonna ask you, um...

343
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,041
Huh. Uh, no, yeah, sorry.
It slipped my mind. I...

344
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,125
That's okay, Captain.

345
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,958
Oh, now I remember.
That Liza... You know Liza, right?

346
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,541
Yes. [chuckles] Of course.

347
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,041
We have been colleagues
for nearly eight years, so I know her.

348
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,083
Yeah, she seems very, uh... very nice. Yeah.

349
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,250
Girl like that
probably has a husband and everything.

350
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,416
Maybe some little ones perhaps, or...

351
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,625
Uh, no. No. She's single. Always been.

352
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,166
Really? Wow.

353
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,541
She probably, um,
misses someone in her life.

354
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,833
- Hmm. Maybe.
- Yeah.

355
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:24,291
And I feel like
I could maybe be that person.

356
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:29,083
Is that... We're just so alike,
you know, so compatible.

357
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,458
- Okay.
- Liza is special.

358
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:36,000
So tender. So sensitive.
Almost shy in a sense.

359
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,958
[Jonathan continues] <i>Kind of a fish
out of water in a tough environment,</i>

360
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,841
<i>- like a cruise ship can be at times.</i>
- [romantic string music playing]

361
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:45,375
<i>Just a delicate flower
in a concrete jungle.</i>

362
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,500
<i>I just hope that she feels safe here,</i>

363
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,333
<i>and that this workplace
doesn't feel toxic to her,</i>

364
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,625
<i>you know, with the kind
of masculine energy</i>

365
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,208
<i>we project on the ship.</i>

366
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:01,791
<i>She has a tender soul,
you know, but hey, that's okay too.</i>

367
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,500
<i>We're just extremely alike,</i>

368
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:07,166
<i>and I feel
like we kind of belong together.</i>

369
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,708
That we might be meant for each other.

370
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,333
You and Ms. Barell?

371
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,750
Sure. Yeah.
Why not, right? Go for it, Captain.

372
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,833
Thanks, Pedro. Good talk.

373
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:24,250
Thanks for the advice.
I'll, uh... I'll go and find her.

374
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,125
- You're a true friend.
- Anytime, <i>mi amigo.</i>

375
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,125
Hmm. "Amigo." Wow.

376
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,416
I don't know what that means,
but it sounds... poetic.

377
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,250
Oh, Liza!

378
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,750
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

379
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,500
- I was actually looking for you.
- How come?

380
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:48,208
- Just, uh... I would really like to talk.
- Um...

381
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,125
- Yeah.
- Uh, well, can it wait?

382
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,375
I really have to take a shower,
get this paint off me.

383
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,666
Oh, is that paint?

384
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,500
Almost looks like blood
or something gross.

385
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,416
Mm-mm. No.

386
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,916
You've got something that looks
like human skin there and... hair?

387
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,833
- Is that...
- No, it's red paint.

388
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,541
- I spilled it all over me by accident.
- Oh.

389
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,375
[chuckles] Well, that is, uh... unlucky.

390
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,541
Uh, well, can you meet me
at the rear deck in ten minutes?

391
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,000
[Liza] Sure, no problem.

392
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,791
Okay. I'm gonna take the hat off.

393
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,416
Too formal. Yeah.

394
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,625
Hello. No, no. Good evening...

395
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,208
Ha... Or, you know, hat on.
Yeah. Keep the hat on.

396
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,333
- There you are, Ms. Barell.
- Here I am.

397
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,791
So what's up, Admiral?

398
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,000
Admiral. [chuckles]

399
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,291
It's, uh... you know, I was thinking...

400
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,916
or not thinking,
I was hoping that, uh, you know...

401
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,583
What were you hoping?

402
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:51,958
Or I wanted to say that I feel
we have a very, very strong chemistry,

403
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,125
so I wanted to ask if, uh...

404
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,208
Ask if?

405
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:01,666
If perhaps you would be open
to the thought of maybe going on a date.

406
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,833
[gurgles]

407
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,500
[strains]

408
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,125
[Jonathan snores]

409
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,583
[Wagner's "Ride of The Valkyries" playing]

410
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,583
Nico, take the left.
Pedro, take the right.

411
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,250
Come on, men. Formation!

412
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,375
It's Jan!

413
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,250
All right, move, move, move, move!

414
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,250
Fuck you, Jan! All sales are final!

415
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,291
[yelling]

416
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,333
Get them!

417
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:43,208
Die, you fuckers!

418
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,041
Fuck!

419
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,166
[yell distorts]

420
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,625
[music ends triumphantly]

421
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,625
[in Norwegian] Lights. Civilization!

422
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,541
Yes, I have eyes.
One tends to notice a city

423
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:18,083
when you have been lost
in the wilderness for weeks.

424
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,458
It's pretty obvious.

425
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:22,458
Yeah, but we made it! We actually made it.

426
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:25,142
We have argued, and it hasn't always been
that pleasant between us,

427
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,458
but we made it.
Should we just run down there?

428
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:31,916
We are not gonna run down there and arrive
in the city like two idiots out of breath.

429
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Why not?

430
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,208
Because that's just stupid.

431
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:38,000
Then we come across as too eager.

432
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,916
It's much cooler if we just camp here
and hang out and... you know...

433
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,791
reminisce about all the things
we've been through

434
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:49,708
and all the dangerous animals we've seen
and those things. It's much better.

435
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:55,291
But... we're so close to our goal,
and it's so extremely dangerous out here.

436
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,541
Come on! We have survived
for weeks out here,

437
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:01,375
and you think something might happen
on the last night? It doesn't make sense.

438
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,750
Ok. Maybe one more night
won't make a difference.

439
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,375
And then we can walk
into the city tomorrow as kings.

440
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,833
- Yeah, strut in there.
- Exactly.

441
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,500
Yes, that's what I envision too.

442
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:16,500
We'll look really cool as we walk
into town and everyone there just... whoo!

443
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:17,583
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

444
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:18,833
- Yeah.
- Okay.

445
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,833
- Good night.
- Good night.

446
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,708
[groans gently]

447
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,708

[deep growling]

449
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:34,791
Oh shit.

450
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,291
Johannes? Johannes?

451
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:38,791
Ah!

452
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,458
[ripping]

453
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,250
Oh. Eh...

454
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,875
Get away. No!

455
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:47,791
[in English] Sit!

456
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:51,083
[in Norwegian] Get away! No, no, no, no!

457
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:57,083

- [crunching]
