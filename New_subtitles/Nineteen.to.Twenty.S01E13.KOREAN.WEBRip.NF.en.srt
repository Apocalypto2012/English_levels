NINETEEN TO TWENTY

12
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,227
Remember how I said...

13
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,981
that I want to stop going
on dates earlier?

14
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,693
I feel like I rejected the date

15
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:14,074
without giving you a proper reason
when you might not know anything

16
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,743
about what's going on,

17
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:22,290
so I felt really sorry.

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,418
I wanted to apologize.

19
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,506
To be honest,

20
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:37,263
I was thinking
about the worst-case scenario

21
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,643
while you were out with Jung-yun.

22
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,521
I thought

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,192
that if you reject the dream date,
I'd ask you out on a casual date.

24
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:53,947
But if you refuse that too,
I would just remain in House 20.

25
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,281
To me,

26
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,244
the dream date
isn't what's really important.

27
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,665
You were the most important.

28
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:14,467
I want you to tell me how you really feel
without worrying about hurting me.

29
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,760
-Please be honest.
-I...

30
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:21,474
Before going on my date today,

31
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:27,730
it's true that I was attracted to you,
and when I said it was half and half,

32
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,524
I really meant it.

33
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,237
I genuinely thought
that you were a really attractive guy.

34
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:41,619
But I feel like
I've come to a decision now

35
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,083
<i>because I really enjoy going
on dates with you,</i>

36
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,211
<i>and you're really cool and sweet,</i>

37
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,091
but I keep thinking of Jung-yun.

38
00:02:55,174 --> 00:03:01,806
I keep feeling guilty toward Jung-yun,
and I keep expecting more from him.

39
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,058
When I was with you,

40
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,561
I kept thinking about Jung-yun,

41
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:13,443
but during my date today,
I didn't think about you.

42
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:20,658
<i>Before, Jung-yun didn't express
his feelings for me.</i>

43
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:25,330
<i>But today, he kept expressing himself
even though it was a bit awkward for him.</i>

44
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:29,125
<i>And he told me firmly
that he only has feelings for me,</i>

45
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,252
<i>and that it wouldn't change.</i>

46
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,756
And even though it was
just a typical date,

47
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:38,343
I felt really happy just being there.

48
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:45,350
So I realized that
I definitely have feelings for Jung-yun.

49
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,979
And I came to the conclusion
that I shouldn't go on

50
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,732
a dream date with you
while I feel that way.

51
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,653
I would be hiding my feelings,

52
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,949
and it wouldn't be right
to do that to you.

53
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,703
To be honest,

54
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:11,668
I obviously guessed how you felt
when you cried

55
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,423
in front of me because of Jung-yun.

56
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,929
I feel like I made you confused

57
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,475
because I wasn't sure
about my own feelings.

58
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,605
But I'm finally sure about how I feel,

59
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,150
and I'm really sorry
that I'm only telling you how I feel

60
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:41,656
the day before the last date.

61
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:49,247
I really don't want you
to feel sorry about that.

62
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,087
I started liking you because I wanted to.

63
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,051
I only expressed my interest in you
because I truly liked you.

64
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,973
Last night, I actually realized

65
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,185
that I wasn't just interested in you
and curious about you.

66
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,981
I realized that I truly like you.

67
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:27,910
I only went on two dates,
and both were with you.

68
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,290
And I was really happy and excited
during every moment.

69
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,460
And because I expressed
my feelings honestly,

70
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,795
I don't have any regrets.

71
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:43,551
Even if I could go back in time,
I would still go on dates with you.

72
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,600
I would totally understand

73
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:56,856
if you were upset
or disappointed with me about this,

74
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:03,696
but I'm really grateful
for you saying that to me. I really am.

75
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,242
You're...

76
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:18,461
really attractive and really pretty.

77
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:24,592
<i>And I feel really grateful that you let me</i>

78
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,431
<i>experience so many great things.</i>

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,544
Why am I crying right now?

80
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,131
It's okay.

81
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,760
I was...

82
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,016
really sincere
about my feelings toward you.

83
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,854
I just hope you know that.

84
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,065
Of course.

85
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:31,576
I never expected myself
to fall for Ji-woo this deeply.

86
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:40,460
<i>For over half my life,
I was solely focused on sports.</i>

87
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:45,423
<i>So I never imagined
I would go through such an experience.</i>

88
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,717
<i>And...</i>

89
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,094
I'm grateful to Ji-woo

90
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:56,350
for letting me feel these emotions
as soon as I turned 20.

91
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,228
I feel happy for having a chance
to go through this.

92
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:06,819
My feelings for Jung-yun were growing to
the point that even Se-yeon could notice.

93
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:11,782
But I was confused about my own emotions
and took too much time realizing them,

94
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,995
hurting Se-yeon in the process.
So I felt really sorry.

95
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,167
{\an8}Q. ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY TO SE-YEON?

96
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:26,797
Going on dates with Se-yeon...

97
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,218
I feel like I'm going to cry...

98
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:58,746
I really enjoyed going on dates
with Se-yeon,

99
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,250
and it's true that I was really happy.

100
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,796
And I want to let him know
that I was genuinely attracted to him...

101
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,145
It must have been difficult,
but they ended it well.

102
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,357
Right, it must have been hard.
But their ending was beautiful.

103
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,859
How could they
have a conversation like that

104
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,486
-at that age?
-Aren't they cool?

105
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,240
She apologized maturely,
and he accepted it maturely.

106
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,784
How could 20-year-olds talk like that?

107
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,868
They're so mature.

108
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,663
Rejection and breakups

109
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,333
-are usually unpleasant.
-You get really emotional.

110
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,962
-Or you'd just hide to avoid them.
-Right.

111
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,131
Yes, but these two...

112
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,009
-They ended it well.
-They accepted it.

113
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,594
It was admirable.

114
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,847
I feel like this was possible

115
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:03,060
because they were both
100 percent sincere the entire time.

116
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,481
DAY SIX AS 20-YEAR-OLDS

117
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,485
6:30 A.M.

118
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,364
-Hi.
-Hi.

119
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,744
-Did you sleep well?
-Yeah.

120
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,455
This is nice.

121
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,332
-It's nice?
-Yes.

122
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,710
-Let's go see the sunrise.
-Right.

123
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,006
You must've slept right away.

124
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,467
Yes, I did.

125
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,470
You must be tired waking up so early.

126
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,139
Yes, but I want to see the sunrise.

127
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,143
The sunrise at Jeju Island with you.

128
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,731
I love it.

129
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:53,527
I'm so excited.
I don't think I've ever seen the sunrise.

130
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,780
Neither have I.

131
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,908
I can't believe I'm seeing
the sunrise in Jeju Island.

132
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,709
-Did you wear the bracelet?
-Of course.

133
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,462
Ji-min!

134
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,256
Hang on. Where did I put mine?

135
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,759
Where did I put it?

136
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,970
"Where did I put it?"

137
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,473
-He'll get upset.
-Oh, no...

138
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,267
-This is awful.
-He's going to be really upset.

139
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,563
You told me to wear it,
so I made sure I did.

140
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,321
Ji-min!

141
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,199
Why didn't you bring it?

142
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,034
I did think something was missing.

143
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,911
Why didn't you wear it?

144
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,915
Why didn't you wear it?

145
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,504
Are you hiding it in your mouth
or something?

146
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,381
Is it a prank?

147
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,385
In her mouth?

148
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,387
I wish it really was there.

149
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,055
He must be pretty upset.

150
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,767
No way...

151
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:11,605
-It's fine.
-No, I'm sure it's in my accessory pouch.

152
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,403
-Our bracelet isn't important.
-It is.

153
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,907
-It must be there.
-I'm sure it is.

154
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,784
-I'll look for it.
-Okay.

155
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,128
{\an8}TOMORROW'S YOUR LAST DAY IN HOUSE 20

156
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:38,215
{\an8}EXPRESS YOUR FEELINGS TO THE PERSON
YOU LIKE BY MIDNIGHT

157
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,135
We're going to see the sunrise.

158
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:46,098
I wanted to start our relationship
right as the sun was coming up.

159
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,476
So I decided to ask her out
during sunrise.

160
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,857
<i>I thought a lot
about how I should ask her out.</i>

161
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,238
-This is so much fun!
-That's pretty fast.

162
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,990
He had time until midnight...

163
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,159
-He's doing it right away.
-In the morning.

164
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,785
At six in the morning.

165
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,996
He's fiery.

166
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,832
-But I'm curious what he'll say.
-Right.

167
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,048
-Let's get off.
-Yeah.

168
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:20,716
Let's go.

169
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:26,931
-I'm so happy all of a sudden.
-It's beautiful!

170
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,934
It's all pink.

171
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,894
The sky...

172
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,855
-Isn't it pretty?
-Yes.

173
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,108
It's so beautiful.

174
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,278
Even the waves are pretty.

175
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,572
Like someone, right?

176
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,957
-Who do you think that is?
-Right, like you.

177
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,219
How did you feel being away from me?

178
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,347
-We were apart for a bit.
-I really missed you.

179
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,515
-You did?
-Yes.

180
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,644
But why didn't you say,
"I'm going to miss you"?

181
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,021
I felt a bit shy.

182
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,107
Me too.

183
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,152
-I'll keep doing it from now on.
-You'd better.

184
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,322
I hope the sun comes up soon.

185
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,658
What are you planning?

186
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,909
He's going to tell her!

187
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,494
He's telling her soon!

188
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,705
What are you going to say?

189
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,627
It's getting brighter.

190
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,181
Where's the sun?
It's getting brighter, though.

191
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,642
It's getting brighter,
but I don't see the sun.

192
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,784
-Actually...
-Yes?

193
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,494
The sun's already up.

194
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,749
It's just covered by the clouds.

195
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,004
No way!

196
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,130
What?

197
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,257
-What do we do?
-Hold my hand.

198
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,720
-Let's just watch the waves. It's nice.
-Okay.

199
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,571
-During our date...
-Yes?

200
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,535
-I was surprised.
-Why?

201
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,121
-When we were eating...
-Yes?

202
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,124
-You looked so pretty.
-Me?

203
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,001
Yes.

204
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,339
Does it look okay?

205
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,758
-You look pretty.
-It is? Let's eat.

206
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:14,848
I'd been thinking of you as just a friend,
but whatever you did, you looked so cute.

207
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:19,228
So I wanted to take care of you
and stay by your side.

208
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:26,485
And since then, I kept thinking about you
before I went to bed.

209
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,445
I kept looking through our photos.

210
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,618
<i>I kept missing you.</i>

211
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,332
I felt happy thinking about
seeing you again the next day.

212
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:49,299
I want to keep looking at our pictures

213
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,552
and seeing you in person.

214
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,931
-I want to keep seeing you.
-Really?

215
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,767
-How?
-So I want to say something.

216
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,685
What?

217
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,895
I want you to be my girlfriend.

218
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,409
-That was romantic.
-Can you place the sun there?

219
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,578
-With computer graphics?
-Yes.

220
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,415
I want you to be my girlfriend.

221
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:37,931
I never imagined I'd hear this on a beach.

222
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,518
And your answer?

223
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,145
My answer?

224
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,772
Can't you guess?

225
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,150
-Is that a yes?
-Isn't it obvious?

226
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:49,985
Yes.

227
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,987
Yes.

228
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,868
This is crazy.

229
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,578
They're the first couple.

230
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,747
I never expected this couple, though.

231
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,957
Me neither. I never expected this.

232
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,129
Oh, my gosh.

233
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,804
I didn't know I'd feel so shy.

234
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,766
-What?
-I felt shy getting asked out.

235
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,852
I felt shy saying it.

236
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,109
So what are we now?

237
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,278
-A couple.
-Right.

238
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,700
I'm never gonna let your hand go.

239
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,249
I'm not letting it go.

240
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,046
<i>I did think that Ye-rin would say yes.</i>

241
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,257
But I still felt really nervous.

242
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:58,929
Now that we're 20, we'll be experiencing
many things for the first time.

243
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,267
And I want Ye-rin to be by my side
when I'm experiencing them.

244
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,645
The dream date with Ji-min

245
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,816
will be a date
I'll never be able to forget.

246
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,736
<i>I'll think of him if I see a lighthouse</i>

247
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,241
<i>or even if I just see the ocean.</i>

248
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,245
<i>Or if I see black pig.</i>

249
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,167
I feel grateful toward him

250
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:34,089
for giving me memories
that I'll never forget.

251
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,718
<i>I want to visit Jeju Island again
with Ji-min.</i>

252
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,220
It's covered by the clouds.
Make them disappear.

253
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,355
I feel shy.

254
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,107
Let's go for a swim!

255
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,446
-Bye!
-Let's go!

256
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,115
It's not coming.

257
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,533
Why isn't it coming to us?

258
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:03,911
Because it's me.

259
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,787
-Because it's me.
-It's us.

260
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,915
Because it's us.

261
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,879
Stay back!

262
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,224
-Oh, no!
-You were really slow.

263
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,520
I'll dig through the fridge.

264
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:31,939
All right.

265
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,945
-Hey!
-What?

266
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,072
-Look!
-What is it?

267
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,242
"Express your feelings
to the person you like by midnight."

268
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,796
As soon as I saw it,

269
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,926
I began wondering
how to express my feelings honestly

270
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:06,098
and let Ji-woo know how I feel about her.

271
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,186
-Did you see the notice outside?
-What is it?

272
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,565
We have to express our feelings
to the person we like by midnight.

273
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,402
-Express our feelings?
-Yes.

274
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,029
-Seriously?
-We have to tell them.

275
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:25,993
I thought, "This is it."

276
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,664
I'm going on a dream date
with Pyeong-seok.

277
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,875
I want to tell him how I feel at the end.

278
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,970
"Tomorrow's your last day in House 20.

279
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,640
Express your feelings
to the person you like by midnight."

280
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,068
<i>It gave me a lot to think about.</i>

281
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:06,533
<i>I was thinking about how I should express
my feelings to Hee-ji.</i>

282
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:15,000
And I also wondered
what Hee-ji was thinking.

283
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,267
-Where's Hee-ji?
-Call her name.

284
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,603
"Hee-ji, come out here!"

285
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,688
"Come out here!"

286
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,901
Hey, don't forget the thing.
Clapping as you enter the house.

287
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:42,819
-Yes?
-Yes?

288
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,493
-Hee-ji, let's go.
-Hang on.

289
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,468
-See you later.
-Bye.

290
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,179
-You'd better come back as a couple.
-Go.

291
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,643
-I'm excited.
-Our last...

292
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,860
-What?
-Can I laugh?

293
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,404
-Why?
-It's just...

294
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,532
Would it be weird if I talk to you now?

295
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,491
-Go on.
-Okay.

296
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,701
-Can I come in?
-Something important? Sure.

297
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,579
Well, it's like preparing
for something important.

298
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,707
-The cafe?
-Yes.

299
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,709
-Like when?
-I mean, let's go.

300
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,171
Okay.

301
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,006
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

302
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,800
-Get ready.
-All right.

303
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,135
Was that it?

304
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,973
We're finally back.

305
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,103
-They must be there, right?
-I hope they are.

306
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,192
-I'm exhausted.
-I'm not exhausted at all.

307
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,198
Then is it called "Han River" in English?

308
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:11,825
Yes.

309
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,451
Hey, they're here.

310
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,705
Your dad was worried!

311
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:24,087
I can't believe you guys went
on an overnight trip.

312
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,632
That was exhausting.

313
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,969
How was it?

314
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,596
-How was it?
-Isn't it obvious?

315
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,145
Ji-min, where's the stuff we bought?

316
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,771
They're here.

317
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,816
-What did you do there?
-So...

318
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,194
-Us?
-Us? We went to the beach.

319
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,321
-Was it fun?
-It was so much fun.

320
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,907
I already ate some of this, though.

321
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,243
And a bit of this.

322
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,495
Is that a matching set?

323
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,998
-That's cute!
-Matching pants! Tangerines.

324
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,459
-But he said they're carrots!
-Carrot pants.

325
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,710
What were you doing?

326
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,923
-Right, did you see that?
-It's today's rule.

327
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,966
-It's today's rule.
-Actually...

328
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,468
-I already did it.
-By today.

329
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,094
You have to tell them.

330
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,846
-I already did it.
-Hey.

331
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,014
-What?
-You're dating?

332
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,349
-You're dating now?
-What?

333
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,976
-Hey! Sit down and tell us!
-What?

334
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,562
-This is crazy.
-Come on. Sit down.

335
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,105
-No way!
-You're dating?

336
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,024
Sit down, guys.

337
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,234
-Sit down?
-Sit.

338
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,652
-Sit.
-Make an announcement.

339
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,445
You seem to have something to tell us.

340
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,155
Come on. Who's going to tell us?

341
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,283
Well, I expressed my feelings
while watching the sun come up.

342
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,163
No way!

343
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,210
-Hold hands!
-Yes, that's it!

344
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,711
Show them.

345
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,296
-Today?
-You said yes?

346
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,215
-Did she?
-Yes.

347
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,050
-Yes, we're dating now.
-No way!

348
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,135
He confessed his feelings!

349
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,762
He did it this morning!

350
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,598
I can't believe it!

351
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,308
Oh, my gosh!

352
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,231
-This is embarrassing!
-Hey, don't touch her!

353
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,067
Keep your distance, guys.
I don't want to see couples.

354
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,111
We ate so much there.

355
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,779
-Ten servings...
-Your hands...

356
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,072
-Ji-min!
-Hey! No!

357
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,075
-Come on!
-What?

358
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,785
What are you guys doing?

359
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,453
Actually...

360
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,621
I knew it.

361
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,374
Right when the sun was coming up...

362
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,710
I was really surprised.

363
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,086
He said it just like that?

364
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,046
-What did he say?
-He's romantic!

365
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,508
-Why should I tell you that?
-It's a secret?

366
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,928
Those two look good together.

367
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,263
-Yes, you're right.
-Right?

368
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,015
-Congratulations!
-Congrats!

369
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:40,932
Congratulations!

370
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,518
-Congratulations!
-I can't believe it.

371
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:50,358
Ji-min and I became
the first official couple of House 20.

372
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:56,031
I was happy because I could spend time
with him more comfortably.

373
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,162
-Have a seat.
-This is nice.

374
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,707
It's our last day... Almost our last day.
How has it been?

375
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,837
I feel like I might cry.

376
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,134
I feel like I got so used to
being with everyone.

377
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,094
Right. It was so much fun.

378
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,221
-The school, and...
-Right.

379
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,351
-It was...
-What?

380
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:28,563
There was some drama, but I think...

381
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,399
it's all fine now.

382
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,151
Sure.

383
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,612
Remember that crazy day?

384
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,323
When they announced
the Busan and Gyeongju trip.

385
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,657
I still remember that.

386
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,785
-Some were crying.
-It was crazy.

387
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,744
Right.

388
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,582
-We were growing up.
-Right. We were becoming adults.

389
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,337
-What?
-Thinking back now, it was fun.

390
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,340
All of this will not be a big deal
once time passes by.

391
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,925
They're all just nice memories.

392
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,135
-Right. Good memories.
-Yes.

393
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,554
Like talking with the guys before bed.

394
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:06,684
I don't think I'll ever forget
our time here. Going from 19 to 20.

395
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:12,899
I have no regrets about the two weeks.
And I didn't want to have any regrets

396
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:17,112
so I wanted to stay true
to my feelings and tell her.

397
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:23,201
Should I tell you how I feel first?
What I wanted to say to you?

398
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:27,372
To be honest, what I want to say
is more about a beginning than an ending.

399
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,790
-Right.
-So...

400
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,420
I really liked you.

401
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,632
I mean, I still like you.

402
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,844
I really like you.

403
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,059
I like you now,
and it's been like that for a while.

404
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,104
I like you a lot.

405
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:56,735
When I first saw you at School 19,
you were there before me.

406
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,571
-Right.
-Ever since I first saw you...

407
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,282
Well, I thought you were pretty.

408
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,659
-Really?
-Yes, I mean it.

409
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,827
When I saw you...

410
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,498
-Hello.
-Hello.

411
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,541
Hello.

412
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,834
Hello.

413
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,923
And my dream is to be an architect.

414
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,258
Nice to meet you.

415
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,263
I think it was PE class.

416
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,432
I was the last one left.

417
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,350
Where is everyone? Sang-won...

418
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,982
Sorry. I took so long.

419
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:39,194
<i>I was the last one left,
but I was happy because you were last too.</i>

420
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:43,114
<i>And when I got the book,
I had butterflies in my stomach.</i>

421
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,659
<i>I gave one to you, and you gave one to me.
My heart fluttered.</i>

422
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,749
<i>And I asked you the most questions
during Ask Me Anything.</i>

423
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,083
After that...

424
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,711
<i>I saw you giving your everything</i>

425
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,464
<i>and always being passionate.</i>

426
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,301
<i>You looked really cool,
but then also seemed clumsy sometimes,</i>

427
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,096
which was very cute.

428
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,099
My feelings for you kept growing.

429
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,978
And when we entered House 20,

430
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:19,275
I was happy to be able to spend
more time with you.

431
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,319
I really enjoyed hanging out with you.

432
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,572
And especially our date at Lotte World.

433
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,867
<i>I'll never be able to forget it.</i>

434
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,079
I feel dizzy.

435
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,082
-From happiness?
-I'm really dizzy.

436
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,500
I'm dizzy with excitement.

437
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,752
I've been thinking...

438
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:44,551
This was a special situation
and we only had two weeks.

439
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:48,513
So it's true that I was being
a bit more rash than I normally am.

440
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,057
And I think I seemed a little impatient.

441
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:55,103
But even so,
I'm certain about my feelings.

442
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,273
I truly do like you,

443
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,527
and what I want to say to you is...

444
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,699
I want us
to get to know each other better.

445
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:12,161
I believe I can show you

446
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,163
an even better side of me.

447
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:19,836
I want to know if you'd like to keep
seeing me and getting to know me better.

448
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,422
I wanted to ask you that.

449
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,344
Did I come on too strong?

450
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,644
Well...

451
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,105
I...

452
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:45,278
I feel like I wasn't entirely
honest about my feelings...

453
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:51,117
I felt pretty confused,
and I've been thinking about us.

454
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,785
But...

455
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,500
it's true that
I was attracted to you the most in school.

456
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,047
But I think

457
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:10,178
my heart fluttered for all those
romantic moments and not you.

458
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:15,725
So my conclusion is that right now,

459
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,354
I'm not romantically attracted to you.

460
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,106
Okay.

461
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:28,988
I wanted to be honest about my feelings.

462
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:35,620
After we ended school
and entered House 20,

463
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:41,709
I could feel how much you liked me,

464
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,380
and that actually felt
a little overwhelming for me.

465
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,549
-And that drove me away a bit.
-Right.

466
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,553
Yes.

467
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:54,681
What?

468
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,058
Do you feel better now?

469
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,185
This really isn't easy.

470
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:04,899
So I just wanted to tell you...

471
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,901
-How you feel?
-Yes.

472
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,698
Right. Thanks for being honest.

473
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,873
I have some regrets.
I don't regret getting closer to you,

474
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:25,086
but I do think that it might've been
better if I acted like I normally would.

475
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,130
But I did what I did.

476
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,758
I want to say that
I'd like us to remain good friends.

477
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:35,972
I had fun.

478
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,807
So we're...

479
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,018
-friends?
-Yes.

480
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,396
We decided to remain as good friends.

481
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:48,735
Even without a romantic interest in her,
Seo-hyeon's really fun to be with,

482
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,737
and she's a really cool friend.

483
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,322
So I was able
to accept her decision calmly,

484
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,908
even though I was a bit disappointed.

485
00:33:55,992 --> 00:34:01,080
Until now, when Sang-won
expressed his feelings toward me,

486
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:05,334
I kept changing the subject
or joking around awkwardly.

487
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,919
And I didn't have the courage,

488
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:11,257
so I had a hard time
telling him how I felt.

489
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:17,055
But after being honest about how I feel,

490
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,973
I feel much better.

491
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:23,394
I finally feel a little more relaxed
and comfortable.

492
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,855
Honesty is the best option.

493
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,065
You're right.

494
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,900
It's hard to reject someone.

495
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,320
Sang-won took it very calmly.

496
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,532
Maybe Sang-won kind of knew
how she felt about him.

497
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,909
-Yes.
-It seemed that way.

498
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,494
I feel a bit sad for him.

499
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,705
Still, he expressed
his feelings without regret

500
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,916
-and tried his best.
-Right.

501
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,544
{\an8}HEE-JI & PYEONG-SEOK'S DREAM DATE

502
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,970
I can't stop smiling.

503
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,014
-What?
-You seem excited.

504
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,811
Let's go.

505
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,401
Are you sure you won't get
motion sickness?

506
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,529
I might throw up.

507
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,494
-I like the vibe here.
-Yeah.

508
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,831
It's pretty.

509
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,249
-So pretty.
-Yeah.

510
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,377
It's your first time here?

511
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,878
Visiting Han River?

512
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,631
-Where should we sit?
-Here.

513
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:38,052
This is nice. I think it'll be even
prettier when it gets dark.

514
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,262
Yeah.

515
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,475
I've never eaten at a place
like this before.

516
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,894
Really?

517
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,480
You too, right?

518
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,065
-Yes.
-Of course.

519
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,359
It's my first time.

520
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,653
Something smells good.

521
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,450
Excuse me for just a moment.

522
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,410
Sure.

523
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,336
-I'll pour the drink for you.
-Thank you.

524
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,279
Enjoy.

525
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,488
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

526
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,577
-It's so cool being here.
-Yeah.

527
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,219
-It's nice here.
-It's even more fun.

528
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,223
It's our last date.

529
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,394
Last... No, it's not our last.

530
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,272
-It's not?
-It's not.

531
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,609
It's the beginning.

532
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,451
I should come back in spring.

533
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,120
With who?

534
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,414
You.

535
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,083
Who?

536
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,753
Kim Pyeong-seok.

537
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,714
Stop smiling.

538
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,138
We should stop smiling too.

539
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,682
Let's all stop smiling.

540
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,684
-I thought she was talking to me.
-This is crazy.

541
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,853
-I feel so happy watching them.
-They're so cute.

542
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,355
Our food's here.

543
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,859
Enjoy your meal.

544
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,071
I feel like I shouldn't ruin it.

545
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,865
Should we try it?

546
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,457
It's good.

547
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,796
My favorite, shrimp.

548
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:20,923
Shrimp.

549
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,264
Shrimp is the best.

550
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,641
Right, you love shrimp.

551
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,281
It's so quiet here.

552
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,367
Say something.

553
00:38:55,207 --> 00:39:01,380
There was something I did want to say,
so I was anxious thinking about it.

554
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,299
It was hard to say it.

555
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,009
Pyeong-seok!

556
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,096
-He's going to say it.
-He's telling her soon.

557
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,556
Who will say it first?

558
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,602
-It was always my first time.
-What?

559
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,271
Everything I do with you is my first time.

560
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,025
Yeah.

561
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,989
I wish we could have fun every day.

562
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,534
Me too.

563
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,455
I'll be so bored when I go back home.

564
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,085
Me too. How will I live?

565
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,545
I'm doomed now.

566
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,214
Come into my pocket.

567
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,343
Take me.

568
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,807
-Can I squeeze you in?
-Yes.

569
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,685
We were together for a week.

570
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,522
Time flies.

571
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,857
When did we get so comfortable?

572
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:14,036
I feel like at some point,
I felt so comfortable.

573
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:16,539
Yeah.

574
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,169
When did you feel that?

575
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,004
For me...

576
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,549
After our first date?

577
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:28,759
What about you?

578
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:33,139
During our first date,
when we clinked glasses.

579
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,267
Cheers.

580
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,566
It's good.

581
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,819
I only noticed yours, though.

582
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,155
-Because it's so deep?
-Yes.

583
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,700
<i>"Gyuka"? Gyukatsu?</i>

584
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,286
What's <i>gyukatsu?</i>

585
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,788
After we rode the taxi...

586
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:02,877
Yeah.

587
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,672
-Relax this finger.
-Relax.

588
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,424
-Make a fist like this.
-Like this?

589
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,508
Fold it.

590
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,178
-There.
-Got it.

591
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,100
It feels like
you're looking at me with four eyes.

592
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,899
I thought your name was cool.

593
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,277
-Kim Pyeong-seok.
-Pyeong-seok.

594
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,031
I was watching you,
and I thought, "New student!"

595
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,578
I remember it clearly.

596
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:43,918
Hi, my name's Kim Pyeong-seok.
I want to become a Hapkido instructor.

597
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,212
"Hi, I'm Kim Pyeong-seok."

598
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,758
You were shy.

599
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,219
You're so shy.

600
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,012
"Any questions?"

601
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,181
"Ask me anything."

602
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,308
"Anything you want to know?"

603
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,648
Is there anything you want to know?

604
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,693
I'm usually kind of quiet...

605
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,321
Awkward, right?

606
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,245
We were talking from a distance.

607
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,205
Yeah.

608
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,209
I still remember the vibe back then.

609
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,088
I've improved a lot.

610
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,965
-Yes.
-I've grown.

611
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,092
-You've grown.
-I'm all grown up.

612
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,677
Not all grown up.

613
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,719
Not enough?

614
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,644
Jeez...

615
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,355
It got dark.

616
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,946
-Let's go look at the city lights.
-It's so dark now.

617
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,699
It's so pretty.

618
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,035
-It is.
-So pretty.

619
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,621
-So pretty.
-Right.

620
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,423
Hey! I think it's snowing.

621
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,674
Is it snowing?

622
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,719
It's faster than I thought.

623
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,767
Is it red? Very red?

624
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,185
It's like that shrimp.

625
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:26,770
-The shrimp?
-Yes.

626
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,691
Are mine red too?

627
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,623
This is so nice.

628
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,666
Should we go on a date every day?

629
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:50,502
Yes.

630
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,009
Would you be my boyfriend?

631
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:00,929
What?

632
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,475
-What?
-Do you want me to be your girlfriend?

633
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,230
You mean it? I was going to ask that.

634
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,691
That was my line.

635
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,863
Well, I said it first.

636
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,283
I'm so happy. I want to shout.

637
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,287
I want you to be my girlfriend.

638
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,873
-Let's date everyday.
-Let's date.

639
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,295
I feel so weird!

640
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,766
I wish everyone in the world knew.

641
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,060
-What?
-That I'm so happy.

642
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,360
It was really dark,
but everything became pink.

643
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,778
Everything looked like hearts.

644
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:58,946
It was like a dream.

645
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:10,416
-They did it.
-Hee-ji's so cool.

646
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,333
She was so cool.

647
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,709
She's so cool!

648
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,045
It's a perfect happy ending.

649
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,464
-Those two were perfect from the start.
-Yeah.

650
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,550
-It's the perfect scene we wanted.
-Yes.

651
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,053
We're a couple now.

652
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,183
-Starting today, we're a couple.
-Yes.

653
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,354
Today is our first day as a couple.

654
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,148
Right.

655
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,444
Can I hold your hand?

656
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,863
Yes.

657
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,160
What? Are we arm wrestling or what?

658
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,749
-Is that a full moon?
-It's round.

659
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,045
It's very round.

660
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:05,888
Your hand...

661
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,561
It's hot.

662
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:20,736
-I'm so happy.
-We should've taken a photo here.

663
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,657
Should we take one now?

664
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,575
Sure.

665
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,746
-We should take it like this.
-Yes.

666
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:36,877
Wait...

667
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:53,936
Oh, my gosh!

668
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,107
Pyeong-seok!

669
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,692
He froze!

670
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,030
-I want to look closely.
-Look at him.

671
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,490
Did she kiss him?

672
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,454
Nothing happened.

673
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,508
-I won't shower today.
-Did something happen?

674
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,304
I won't wash my face.

675
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,557
I can't shower today.

676
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:38,981
That feeling...

677
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,567
I was so surprised.

678
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:45,028
It's hard to describe
how I felt at that moment.

679
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,738
I was really happy.

680
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:51,159
{\an8}Q. DID YOU NOT WASH YOUR FACE?

681
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,413
I did. Very hard.

682
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,209
I washed this side gently,
but very hard here.

683
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,010
Our signature pose.

684
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,308
Our first day!

685
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:16,935
Look over here.

686
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,020
-What?
-It's a video.

687
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:24,151
-Our first day.
-Our first day as a couple.

688
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,612
With Pyeong-seok.

689
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,908
My dimple.

690
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,497
Let's make a dimple here.

691
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,847
I told the others yesterday

692
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,436
that I'd come back clapping
if I'm in a good mood.

693
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,022
-Really?
-Yes.

694
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,941
I should enter doing a headstand.

695
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,911
Your nose is red.

696
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,412
-It's cold.
-Right?

697
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,793
We dressed too lightly.

698
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,385
It'll be long-distance.

699
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,387
Lots of couples do it.

700
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,181
We can meet up often.

701
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,191
-Heart?
-Heart?

702
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:48,360
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

703
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,613
What? Once more. One, two, three!

704
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,575
-Smaller.
-One, two, three.

705
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,953
-I think it worked.
-Once more.

706
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,496
One, two, three! Go!

707
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,256
The heart is...

708
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:15,262
Nice!

709
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,472
We're clapping a lot today.

710
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:22,769
We now have the second official couple
of <i>Nineteen to Twenty.</i>

711
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,897
They're both worried
about dating long-distance.

712
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:30,026
Still, they'll be able to meet
on the weekends.

713
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,321
Pyeong-seok's working
at the Hapkido center with his dad.

714
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,241
He might rush over as soon
as the center closes.

715
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:37,409
-He might.
-He would.

716
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,661
-At that age...
-And he can drive.

717
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,496
He'll say,
"I came just for a bit, Hee-ji."

718
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,291
-Just to see her for five minutes.
-He really might.

719
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,627
Imagine he gets a new member
and it turns out to be Hee-ji.

720
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,255
Guys, this isn't a romance drama.

721
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,591
I really hope they stay together
for a long time.

722
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,050
I hope they get married.

723
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:58,513
-I want those two to last forever.
-Yeah. They look so great together.

724
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,892
It's kind of cold.

725
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,063
How is it like being my boyfriend
at House 20?

726
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,025
I love it.

727
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,779
That's it? That was too short.

728
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,447
You tell me, then.

729
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,575
I like being with you.

730
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,828
That's way too short.

731
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,126
-Choi.
-Lee.

732
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,044
-Cross.
-Cross.

733
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,465
What if another girl does this?

734
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:36,927
What if I do it?

735
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,012
If you do it?

736
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,890
What will you do
if I do this to you, then?

737
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,981
It's nice wherever we are.

738
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,608
Yeah.

739
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,443
As long as we are together.

740
00:51:58,782 --> 00:51:59,616
-Hi!
-Hey.

741
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,659
I'm back.

742
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,411
-You're still here, Jung-yun?
-Should I be somewhere?

743
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:07,290
Seo-hyeon said she was going somewhere,
so I thought she was meeting you.

744
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,252
We're going to have a meal together later.

745
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,254
EARLIER TODAY

746
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,171
Hurry.

747
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,590
-Hurry.
-I don't want you to feel pressured,

748
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,342
but let's just have a...

749
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,637
-What? When?
-Have a dinner together.

750
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,224
-Between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.?
-Okay.

751
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,061
Where are you going?

752
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:30,438
I don't know.
She just wanted to eat together.

753
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,439
What did you say?

754
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,692
-What did she say?
-I got rejected.

755
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:34,609
You got rejected?

756
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,862
Did you tell her how you felt?

757
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,822
-Yes, a bit...
-What did she say to that?

758
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:42,075
She said she wasn't interested in me,
so I just said all right.

759
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:44,870
Oh, no...

760
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,541
-Don't mess it up at the end.
-I'm still so confused.

761
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,209
Why does she want to see me?

762
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,587
Do you know? Did you hear anything?

763
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,797
-No, nothing.
-But why...

764
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:59,843
-I'll see you later, guys.
-Bye.

765
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:03,388
HWANHUI
CASUAL FUSION RESTAURANT

766
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,283
-I'm here.
-You're a bit late.

767
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,078
-There was traffic.
-I waited for so long.

768
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,002
What should we get?

769
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,420
-Did you order something?
-No.

770
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,387
-Why is this so funny?
-Your expression...

771
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,641
Let's enjoy our meal.

772
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,935
I'll talk when we're done.

773
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,811
-Okay.
-Brace yourself.

774
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,313
-Brace myself?
-Yes.

775
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,898
-I'm getting anxious.
-Why?

776
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,483
Do you know what I'll say?

777
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,653
-No, that's why I'm anxious.
-You have no clue?

778
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,208
<i>During my date with Jung-yun yesterday,</i>

779
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:17,462
<i>I realized that I have more feelings
toward him for sure.</i>

780
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:21,758
<i>And I wondered how to express
my feelings toward him</i>

781
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,052
<i>while I waited for him to come back.</i>

782
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,199
-This is so good.
-Eat up.

783
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,035
I'm full.

784
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,000
Okay, let's hear it.

785
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,256
-What's this about?
-At first...

786
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,342
I wanted to pick fights with you.

787
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,177
In the beginning?

788
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,220
-I see.
-Every day.

789
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:11,391
-Keep picking fights and argue...
-Right.

790
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,518
And tease you.

791
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,146
-Like now?
-Yes.

792
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,897
-You're doing that now.
-Yes.

793
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,149
I kept acting that way.

794
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,651
I kept doing that to you in school.

795
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,029
-Did you feel that?
-Yes.

796
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,156
I'll show you my skills.

797
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,533
Great.

798
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,118
-No, don't do that.
-Jeez.

799
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,077
Don't do that pose.

800
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,204
-That's my signature pose.
-No.

801
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,622
You look great right now.

802
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,625
Should I have a meeting as well?

803
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,295
Let's have a meeting.

804
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,338
-We need to do a meeting.
-Right.

805
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:46,509
Everything Jung-yun does is so funny.
The way he talks is funny,

806
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,386
and his expressions too.

807
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,063
-I...
-Hey...

808
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,190
-I just...
-You're so funny.

809
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,111
I didn't do anything.
I just looked through the window.

810
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,448
-Jung-yun's so...
-Jung-yun's just so funny.

811
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:12,285
I think it'll be fun
to do it with Jung-yun.

812
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,915
-It's been quite a while.
-Right.

813
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,042
-She's been interested in him.
-Right.

814
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:23,671
And that didn't change
when we entered House 20.

815
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,715
I kept wanting to tease you.

816
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,343
-Right.
-Yes.

817
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:30,512
Seo-hyeon, your shoulders look wider.

818
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:34,390
These are just shoulder pads.
Aren't they great?

819
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:38,353
-You'll end up... Don't stop him.
-Slow down.

820
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:41,022
What's wrong with you? Manager Lim...

821
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,357
You got your nails done.

822
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,360
Isn't it cute?

823
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:53,118
Ji-woo and Jung-yun were basically
dating right next to me.

824
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:57,622
I didn't get to listen properly
because I felt so irritated,

825
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,707
but they seemed to be having fun.

826
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,210
{\an8}Q. WHY WERE YOU IRRITATED?

827
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,257
It's nothing.

828
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:16,391
-Did you enjoy it?
-Yes, it was good.

829
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:20,395
I asked when the Lunar New Year was,
and you said so confidently...

830
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,021
I just heard you wrong.

831
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,151
Oh, that's a first.

832
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,570
You got it. Put your right foot there.

833
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,614
I just felt a bit...

834
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,491
I thought about it,

835
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,246
and I realized that I wanted to tease you
because I liked you a bit.

836
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,209
-You realized it a bit late.
-Yes.

837
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,170
I felt it.

838
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:48,798
-But I teased you a lot too.
-You...

839
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,261
You were joking around,
but your eyes were always

840
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,180
focused on Ji-woo.

841
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,514
Only Ji-woo.

842
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:00,602
Yeah, so...

843
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:05,023
Honestly, that's why I told myself
that I was wrong.

844
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,735
I told myself you're just a friend
I feel comfortable with.

845
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:12,197
Yes... That's what I tried to think.

846
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:22,499
But this was sudden for me too.
It's very sudden, because until now,

847
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:27,086
I was quite confused
because of my feelings toward Sang-won.

848
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:32,091
So after I made up my mind and thought
about my feelings,

849
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,802
I came to this conclusion.

850
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,223
Right.

851
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,809
So, how do you feel?

852
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,646
-It's unexpected, right?
-Yes.

853
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:45,688
-You had no idea?
-Yeah.

854
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:46,940
I didn't know it either.

855
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:53,279
Things might have been better
if I had realized it sooner.

856
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,739
So I decided

857
00:58:55,823 --> 00:59:01,788
that I would regret it less
if I told you how I feel today.

858
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:09,170
<i>I had no idea that Seo-hyeon
had been feeling that way towards me,</i>

859
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,673
so I was surprised.

860
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:18,429
I thought, "Seo-hyeon must have
gone through a lot."

861
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,893
But I thought she was quite brave

862
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,895
for still telling me her feelings
at the end.

863
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:35,154
I didn't even realize my own feelings,
and I couldn't do anything.

864
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,950
You should've helped out.

865
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:41,035
-Me? How?
-Yes.

866
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:46,249
We should've at least gone
to eat <i>hanwoo</i> omakase.

867
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,376
You wanted to go there?

868
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:52,547
Sang-won and I came back
from our date at three,

869
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,340
and everyone was asleep.

870
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,217
And I saw that <i>hanwoo</i> omakase date.

871
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,346
-Go and shower. I had fun.
-Goodnight.

872
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,849
-See you.
-Okay.

01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:06,769
DREAM DATES: FULL RENTAL OF A MOVIE
THEATER, HANWOO OMAKASE

874
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,271
But even back then...

875
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,356
Even if I knew my feelings,

876
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:14,444
I wouldn't have had the courage.

877
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:16,446
-Right, courage is important.
-Yes.

878
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,406
I really felt it this time.

879
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:21,534
Mustering up your courage
is really important.

880
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:25,955
I really felt it recently.
So I'll be braver from now on.

881
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:27,749
Anyway, that's it.

882
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,084
I'm rooting for you.

883
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,920
I hope you succeed

884
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,799
and get to marry her.

885
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,179
Jung-yun

886
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:47,310
is the first guy
I confessed my feelings to,

887
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,021
and the first guy I got rejected by.

888
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:55,818
I guess he's my first unrequited love.

889
01:00:56,486 --> 01:01:00,698
But after telling Jung-yun
how I felt about him honestly,

890
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:05,453
I feel like I could end things
without any regrets.

891
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:07,288
I feel pretty relaxed now.

892
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,500
She's so cool.

893
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,628
-I want to say good job to her.
-Yeah.

894
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,047
That was quite a surprise, though.

895
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:22,261
Seo-hyeon already knew
that Jung-yun wouldn't accept

896
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,554
-her feelings.
-Right.

897
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,599
-But she still told him.
-Right. About how she feels.

898
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,936
I wouldn't have had the courage.
It was so clear.

899
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,771
-Ji-woo and Jung-yun...
-Right.

900
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:35,733
I would've thought,
"What's the point of telling him now?"

901
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,777
-Right, I understand.
-She was brave.

902
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,904
-Yes.
-I feel like I'm learning from her.

903
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:42,281
Are we going to confess
our feelings tomorrow?

904
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,201
-Let's all do it.
-For real.

905
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,578
I feel like
I should be doing something too.

906
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,331
-We should do something.
-Should we do it too?

907
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,083
-Confess our feelings?
-Right.

908
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,210
-I'll do it.
-It feels like we should.

909
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,462
-"I think I like you."
-We should.

910
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,316
-What?
-Hey.

911
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,362
What were you doing?

912
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,657
-What were you doing?
-Waiting for you.

913
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:25,742
-Since when?
-What?

914
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:26,659
Since when?

915
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:29,537
I don't know.

916
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,164
-Did you fall asleep?
-Yes.

917
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:35,793
I slept here, and upstairs,
then down here again.

918
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,477
What should I say first?

919
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,022
Well... I...

920
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,611
Ever since the beginning...

921
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,198
and until now...

922
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,037
I've liked you, and I'll keep liking you.

923
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:15,750
-Right...
-So...

924
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:22,548
let's keep seeing each other
even after we leave here.

925
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:23,925
-Okay.
-Okay.

926
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:26,093
So...

927
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,888
let's keep seeing each other.

928
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:30,681
You...

929
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:39,565
were also the first guy
I was attracted to.

930
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,530
I felt confused for a bit
in the middle of all this,

931
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:51,702
but I realized it was you that I like.

932
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:58,417
-So we're just getting started.
-Right.

933
01:03:58,835 --> 01:03:59,669
Right.

934
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,922
-Our new beginning.
-It'll be fun.

935
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,427
-Why is your hand so cold?
-I was outside.

936
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:12,473
It was cold outside.
It's snowing right now.

937
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,934
-It's snowing.
-What? Why?

938
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,018
I don't know.

939
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:17,812
-No way!
-Right?

940
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,105
-No way.
-So nice, right?

941
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:23,067
-Why is it snowing now?
-Isn't it the first snow of the year?

942
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,027
-It is.
-Right?

943
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:29,490
Cool.

944
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:32,577
On our last day... I mean, our first day.

945
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:35,580
-Our first day?
-Yes.

946
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:37,957
First day, first snow.

947
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:45,214
-The snow...
-It's so pretty.

948
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,091
I had no idea it was snowing.

949
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,969
-I didn't, either.
-It's so nice.

950
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,772
We're seeing the first snow together.

951
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,316
You're right.

952
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,532
What do you want to do when we leave?

953
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:13,242
-When we leave?
-Yes.

954
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,121
Anything would be nice.

955
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,377
As soon as I saw her,

956
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:27,757
I began to like her
and that feeling continued.

957
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,554
-How did you feel when you saw me?
-I was thrilled.

958
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,640
-What?
-I was thrilled at the news.

959
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:36,891
-Really?
-Yes.

960
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:40,686
Two, three, cha-cha-cha.

961
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,564
-Hey, you're good.
-Two, three, cha-cha-cha.

962
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,905
Do you want to go on a date with me?

963
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,199
Do you want to?

964
01:05:55,618 --> 01:06:00,206
We talked about going to the theater,
the Han River,

965
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,959
and an amusement park together
when we leave,

966
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,503
so I'm looking forward to that.

967
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:09,715
If Jung-yun's hands are cold,
I'll warm them up for him,

968
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:14,637
and if my hands are cold,
Jung-yun will warm them up for me.

969
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,104
-The first.
-Right.

970
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,778
-Should we go?
-Should we go?

971
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:31,904
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

972
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,617
Why do you keep laughing?

973
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,498
TOMORROW'S YOUR LAST DAY IN HOUSE 20

974
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:44,166
EXPRESS YOUR FEELINGS
TO THE PERSON YOU LIKE BY MIDNIGHT

975
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:46,794
Congratulations.

976
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:49,547
-They finally ended up together.
-A happy ending.

977
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:52,049
They went through so much
and ended up together.

978
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,634
They're our third couple.

979
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,011
Our third couple.

980
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:58,014
This is what
we've been waiting for so long.

981
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,348
Right.

982
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,684
-We were waiting so desperately.
-Seriously.

983
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:05,354
It was cute, though.
Jung-yun seemed to have run a simulation.

984
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:09,942
-Yes.
-He said what he memorized like a robot.

985
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:11,902
Right. Ji-woo was half-asleep.

986
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,863
He suddenly came up to her and said it.

987
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:16,032
-It's just like him.
-"Let's keep seeing each other."

988
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:19,452
It all went naturally.

989
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:22,997
-It's just like him, though.
-Ji-woo would think it was cute.

990
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,249
I think she was like,
"Did he just ask me out?"

991
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,252
-Bye.
-See you later.

992
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:30,504
-No.
-What? Okay.

993
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,631
I mean, all right.

994
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,008
I have to pack up.

995
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,886
You were busy today. Hurry.

996
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:39,138
Go and pack up.

997
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:40,598
-What?
-Bye.

998
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:44,769
-No way!
-What?

999
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:47,813
-What did I just see?
-What?

1000
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,148
-Hang on.
-What?

1001
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:52,985
-Did you hold hands?
-No. I was sending him away like this.

1002
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:53,903
You held hands!

1003
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,447
-What?
-You did, right?

1004
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,907
-And I spotted you!
-What?

1005
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,492
-Hey!
-What?

1006
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,826
-Guys!
-What are you doing?

1007
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,579
-Jung-yun and Ji-woo held hands.
-I...

1008
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,414
Hey!

1009
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,166
We can't allow that.

1010
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,336
-Did you guys talk?
-You and Jung-yun?

1011
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:11,796
-Yes.
-And you're dating?

1012
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:14,423
-Yes.
-Hey, they're dating!

1013
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,258
Don't say that so loudly!

1014
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,135
My babies.

1015
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,595
-What?
-Hey!

1016
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:20,805
-What?
-Hee-ji?

1017
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:23,432
-Are you dating too?
-Tell us. What happened?

1018
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,101
-Are you together?
-What happened?

1019
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:26,685
You're together too?

1020
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,147
-Did you say it?
-Yes.

1021
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:31,732
-Who said it?
-I did.

1022
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,527
So what happened? You're dating now?

1023
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:36,153
Yes.

1024
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,197
Crazy!

1025
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,698
There are three couples now.

1026
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,409
-Jeez!
-Three couples.

1027
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:45,788
-Hey.
-I'm back.

1028
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,373
-You're back.
-Hey.

1029
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,291
-Did it go well?
-How did it go?

1030
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,459
Well...

1031
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,461
-Did it go well?
-So what happened?

1032
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:53,963
What happened?

1033
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:57,591
-Well...
-Come on. Spill.

1034
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,220
Everyone, clap your hands!

1035
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:07,268
Pyeong-seok! You did it!

1036
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,021
It's snowing a lot.

1037
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,150
-Do you want a photo?
-Yeah.

1038
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:19,530
Guys, stand back to back.
Look in opposite directions.

1039
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:21,198
Yes, like that.

1040
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:24,910
All right. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

1041
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,957
-You guys look alike.
-Should we look at each other?

1042
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,543
That looks nice.

1043
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:39,008
-It looks pretty good.
-I love this photo.

1044
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:41,093
Isn't it awesome?

1045
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,971
One, two, three.

1046
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:46,724
-Got it.
-It's amazing.

1047
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:50,644
<i>It's snowing</i>

1048
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:52,479
<i>-on our last day.
-Tell me about it.</i>

1049
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,402
-Try it.
-Oh, I like that.

1050
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:03,616
Mine is broken.

1051
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:05,701
My heart's broken.

1052
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:07,369
It's snow.

1053
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:18,380
HOUSE 20

1054
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:23,135
It's so pretty!

1055
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,013
Another feast?

1056
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,231
-It looks so good.
-I can't leave.

1057
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,025
-I won't go home.
-This looks delicious.

1058
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:40,903
-I've seen this before.
-Didn't we see this before?

1059
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,030
-Our first day.
-The same food.

1060
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:44,031
Right.

1061
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:47,326
Guys, I'll pour you all a drink today.

1062
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,620
Okay. I'll just open this for you, then.

1063
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:51,622
Careful!

1064
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:54,208
It might pop at any moment.

1065
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,126
Oh, no!

1066
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,003
-Pop!
-It's not working.

1067
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:58,921
Hurry...

1068
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:00,673
Awesome!

1069
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:02,258
-I'm getting good at this.
-Yes.

1070
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,425
-My gosh.
-This sauce...

1071
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,886
-Our eldest...
-Thank you.

1072
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:08,013
-Thank you!
-Hang on.

1073
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,640
What? What is it?

1074
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,359
What is he doing?

1075
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,694
He's so weird.

1076
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:25,990
-He learned something from the restaurant.
-Have a good day.

1077
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:28,951
Hey, this is all just foam!

1078
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:31,328
There's nothing to drink.

1079
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:34,331
Don't do it. Just stop, Pyeong-seok.

1080
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:37,584
-You're so bad at this.
-What's with this?

1081
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,713
Guys, it's our last night here.

1082
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:41,880
Hey, be quiet.

1083
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,090
-No, we...
-It's okay.

1084
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:44,300
No.

1085
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:52,933
Shall we toast?

1086
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:54,435
Nineteen!

1087
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:56,145
-To Twenty!
-To Twenty!

1088
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:57,229
Cheers from afar.

1089
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:08,907
-Can you drink more now?
-It's not... It's good.

1090
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:11,452
-Do you like it or not?
-It's good.

1091
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,333
I think I'm going to cry.

1092
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,045
Ji-min!

1093
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,339
-So good.
-You drank it all up?

1094
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:24,256
So good.

1095
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:26,925
He drank it all.

1096
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:29,595
-The champagne's awesome.
-Is it good?

1097
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:32,389
-It's tasty!
-Ji-min.

1098
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,308
-He's going to change soon!
-Right!

1099
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,935
We're going to see him drunk again.

1100
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,145
Please...

1101
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:40,189
FIRST DAY AT HOUSE 20

1102
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:42,524
Thank you for your hard work.

1103
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:45,861
Hey! Don't try to be funny.

1104
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:47,613
You just dropped...

1105
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:50,824
His facial expression's totally
different! Look!

1106
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:52,493
-My gosh!
-This is good.

1107
01:12:52,576 --> 01:12:54,745
Ji-min, don't drink again. Okay?

1108
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:57,373
-Let's just eat.
-All right.

1109
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,709
Are you embarrassed of me
as my girlfriend?

1110
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,045
Hey.

1111
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:04,797
Let's just eat.

1112
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:06,590
Yes, ma'am.

1113
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:13,847
Are we giving a recital?

1114
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:15,891
LIM JUNG-YUN

1115
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:17,351
{\an8}CHOI SEO-HYEON

1116
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:19,311
OUR MOTHERLY HEE-JI

1117
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,188
LOVE YOU, SEO-YEONG

1118
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:24,066
HI, SE-YEON. IT'S SEO-YEONG!

1119
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:25,692
Here.

1120
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:27,528
Moon Se-yeon.

1121
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,030
This is way too long!

1122
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:31,615
-Oh Sang-won.
-Thank you.

1123
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:34,410
Hang on. I don't think I can read this.

1124
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:36,453
Se-yeon, I mean what I wrote.

1125
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,414
-What?
-I mean what I wrote.

1126
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,124
-Seo-yeong!
-I can't read it.

1127
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:50,008
THANKS FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS.

1128
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,093
Se-yeon.

1129
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:55,389
We both had feelings for Ji-woo,

1130
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:58,934
so we could have become
awkward and distant with each other,

1131
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:00,853
but now...

1132
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,272
Want to drink beer outside?

1133
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,190
Let's go, buddy.

1134
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,818
<i>But you always spoke to me first,</i>

1135
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:14,783
<i>and you were so friendly,
so we were able to stay as close friends</i>

1136
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:19,204
and hang out together.
So I'm really grateful.

1137
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,123
Let's hang out often after we leave.

1138
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:23,083
Jung-yun.

1139
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:31,884
<i>You seemed to be someone special
from the beginning.</i>

1140
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:35,596
<i>I feel like we've become
really close friends</i>

1141
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:39,141
<i>who can share anything with each other.</i>

1142
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:45,856
And I really hope that
you'll date Ji-woo without any regrets.

1143
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:52,905
<i>And I hope we can continue to be friends
who can keep in touch</i>

1144
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:55,199
<i>and hang out regularly.</i>

1145
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:59,745
Se-yeon, you were the one

1146
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:03,874
who made my heart flutter
when I first entered School 19.

1147
01:15:03,957 --> 01:15:07,044
I struggled a fair bit for a while
because of you,

1148
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:08,795
I mean, thanks to you.

1149
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:15,427
But let's root for each other
as good friends.

1150
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:17,596
Ji-min.

1151
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:20,098
Well... I hope

1152
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:27,022
you will care for Ye-rin
as much as I liked you.

1153
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,567
I hope I'll see you around. Bye.

1154
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,822
Ye-rin!

1155
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,128
-Don't cry.
-I'm not crying.

1156
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:53,006
-I cry when I see others cry!
-Who's crying? Hee-ji?

1157
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:54,007
Come on!

1158
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,261
She's really crying, though.

1159
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:00,639
-She started crying.
-Why are you crying?

1160
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,725
Hey, don't cry! Why would you cry?

1161
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,227
I'm not crying.

1162
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:08,772
I'll write you all letters tomorrow.

1163
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:10,607
-Okay.
-You mean it?

1164
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:12,734
I got to know you guys a bit late...

1165
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:17,698
-I remember when he first came.
-He didn't talk at all.

1166
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:19,616
He's totally different now.

1167
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,661
I remember how he smiled
while hugging that cushion.

1168
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,789
-Oh, that?
-The photo in the lounge.

1169
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:29,376
-This is embarrassing.
-Your smile is great!

1170
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,296
Hey, you look so adorable!

1171
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:35,966
-Pyeong-seok.
-Go on.

1172
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:37,634
Thank you for...

1173
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:42,639
-Don't cry!
-What?

1174
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:53,692
Hang on.

1175
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:08,415
It's not like I'll never see them again,

1176
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,631
but knowing that it was our last day,
I felt so sad about it.

1177
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:22,220
I...

1178
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:23,805
He's really crying.

1179
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:26,850
-Hey...
-Thanks for taking care of me.

1180
01:17:26,933 --> 01:17:28,518
-No!
-Hey!

1181
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:29,978
Don't cry!

1182
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,813
-His eyes are red.
-I don't usually...

1183
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,982
I start crying when somebody else cries.

1184
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:38,445
-I'm not crying.
-Don't cry.

1185
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:40,614
-He's really crying.
-Come on.

1186
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:48,121
Thanks for taking care of the quiet
and dumb new student.

1187
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:50,499
Oh, no. He's really crying.

1188
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,169
-Are you crying, Ji-woo?
-I'm not.

1189
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:58,006
-Thank you!
-Thanks, everyone!

1190
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,802
Why do I keep getting teary eyed?

1191
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:04,971
Thinking about Hee-ji just makes me cry.

1192
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:07,307
-Really.
-Hey.

1193
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:11,728
Why are you crying?

1194
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:16,983
Stop crying. I cry if someone else cries.

1195
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:22,155
Hee-ji was always
taking care of the rest of us.

1196
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,867
Hee-ji took good care of us
although it must've been tough.

1197
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:28,203
It wasn't tough at all.

1198
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:30,288
It must have been tough.

1199
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:34,501
It must have been so hard.

1200
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:36,837
Choi Seo-hyeon.

1201
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,964
Locking eyes with Seo-hyeon made me cry.

1202
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:41,883
We all went through a lot.

1203
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:49,391
I guess we could say the two weeks
were short yet long,

1204
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:54,104
but I think we all managed

1205
01:18:56,606 --> 01:19:01,570
our emotions well
and maintained positive feelings.

1206
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,697
Thank you for that.

1207
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:05,449
And I am so happy.

1208
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:08,160
Thank you, guys.

1209
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:11,204
Thanks, everyone.

1210
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:13,832
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

1211
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,377
Our happiness is just starting.

1212
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:20,464
-Right, this is just the beginning.
-Of course.

1213
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:32,851
I want us to remain as friends

1214
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:35,520
and even if we do part...

1215
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,815
What do I do?

1216
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:41,443
-That's in your mind already?
-Don't cry.

1217
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:43,403
Even if we part...

1218
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,197
You shouldn't be laughing.

1219
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:49,242
Let's all just get along. I'm so happy,

1220
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:51,286
-and I really love you guys.
-Thank you.

1221
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:55,540
Our life in House 20 is over,
but our 20s just started.

1222
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,126
To our 20s.

1223
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,337
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1224
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:07,302
<i>It was like a blissful memory
of spending my last days as a 19-year-old</i>

1225
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:11,765
<i>and first days as a 20-year-old
with wonderful friends.</i>

1226
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:17,604
<i>I wondered if I'd be able
to feel those emotions again.</i>

1227
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,524
<i>I feel like I've matured in many ways.</i>

1228
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:26,196
<i>I believe I'll be a much better person
when I step into society.</i>

1229
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:30,325
<i>I realized and learned
how to be honest about my feelings.</i>

1230
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:33,453
<i>It was a very meaningful time.</i>

1231
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:38,667
I believe all ten of us

1232
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:43,213
were able to have a special experience
compared to other 20-year-olds.

1233
01:20:43,296 --> 01:20:46,132
<i>I think we've ended our teenage years
full of happiness,</i>

1234
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:49,845
<i>and the beginning
of our 20s was full of ups and downs.</i>

1235
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:53,932
I believe we were able to learn
and grow a lot.

1236
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:58,562
Living with everyone for two weeks
helped me grow as well.

1237
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:02,566
School 19 was full of joy,

1238
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:06,152
<i>and we spent time
getting to know each other.</i>

1239
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:13,743
<i>Then House 20 allowed us to see
every aspect of each other.</i>

1240
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,039
<i>We all grew to care a lot
about each other.</i>

1241
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:22,127
I hope we can all remain friends

1242
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:25,255
for 10 or 20 years after this.

1243
01:21:25,338 --> 01:21:27,549
I wish that we had

1244
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:32,387
more time together.

1245
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:36,224
I will never be able to forget
this memory.

1246
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:40,896
I won't be able to forget this experience,

1247
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:45,442
and I thought to myself that it would be
nice to return to House 20 someday.

1248
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:50,155
I hope we can gather here
in winter again someday

1249
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,366
and watch the snowfall together.

1250
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:54,492
Nineteen!

1251
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,286
-To Twenty!
-To Twenty!

1252
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:03,376
All right.

1253
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:08,340
<i>Nineteen to Twenty</i>
was like a coming-of-age drama.

1254
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:13,553
Two weeks isn't really a long time
if you think about it.

1255
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:16,014
But the kids seem to have matured a lot.

1256
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:19,601
I learned a lot too.
Like, "I should muster up my courage."

1257
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:25,523
They made me think a lot about
when I was 19 and 20.

1258
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:29,945
I thought about how I was
when I was at that age,

1259
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:36,451
who my friends were at that time,
and how I hung out with them.

1260
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:37,869
Things like that.

1261
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,412
And seeing them,

1262
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:42,624
I also wished that their friendship
would last forever.

1263
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:47,545
I was totally immersed.
I felt like I was part of the group.

1264
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,839
-I'm rooting for them.
-Yes, right.

1265
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:53,301
I feel like I'll keep thinking
about this for a long time,

1266
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:58,431
and I felt proud seeing them grow
as if I'd raised them myself.

1267
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:00,600
And I feel envious as well.

1268
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:06,356
Seeing them go to sleep feeling excited
about the next day,

1269
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:09,776
I thought to myself that I should

1270
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:13,780
live each day happily and joyfully
without losing spirit.

1271
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:19,577
It's the most innocent
and beautiful time of your life.

1272
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:24,582
The moment you turn 20.
So I felt envious of them.

1273
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:27,711
When I was little,
I just wanted to grow up.

1274
01:23:27,794 --> 01:23:29,838
-Right.
-But when I became an adult,

1275
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:34,300
I could understand why grown-ups
want to go back in time.

1276
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,137
-We can never go back.
-Right.

1277
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,222
Unless we have a <i>Thirty-Nine to Forty...</i>

1278
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:42,434
<i>Thirty-Nine to Forty?</i>

1279
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:44,853
-Instead of <i>Nineteen to Twenty?
-Yeah.</i>

1280
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,105
-That'll be fun.
-So...

1281
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:52,402
So I hope a lot of kids
who are just turning 20 will watch this

1282
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:55,155
-and feel their youth too.
-Right, I agree.

1283
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:57,449
-Kids at that age.
-Right.

1284
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,500
LAST DAY AT HOUSE 20

1285
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:09,961
<i>It's really our last day?</i>

1286
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,922
We're really leaving now.

1287
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,424
We're really leaving.

1288
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:17,886
-Bye, House 20!
-Goodbye.

1289
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:19,554
Bye, House 20.

1290
01:24:19,637 --> 01:24:21,056
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

1291
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:22,891
Let's go.

1292
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:27,729
I feel sad.

1293
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:30,774
Time flew by.

1294
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:34,944
Doors closing!

1295
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:36,780
-Let's go.
-Goodbye.

1296
01:24:39,532 --> 01:24:40,533
Bye, House 20.

1297
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:43,536
Bye.

1298
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,176
We're leaving.

1299
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:01,346
Goodbye!

1300
01:25:02,388 --> 01:25:03,264
Say bye.

1301
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,600
Bye!

1302
01:25:08,728 --> 01:25:11,147
<i>Do you like me? That's all that matters.</i>

1303
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,857
<i>Do you want to have dinner
with me tomorrow?</i>

1304
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,609
<i>-Dinner?
-Are you down?</i>

1305
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:19,197
<i>I mean, then he shouldn't have
made it sound like he liked me.</i>

1306
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:21,741
<i>I'm a woman. I'm a woman.</i>

1307
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:27,288
<i>You. I wanted to get to know you more.</i>

1308
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,790
<i>I'll be the chef today.</i>

1309
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:31,876
<i>-Three!
-Two!</i>

1310
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:32,794
<i>One!</i>

1311
01:25:32,877 --> 01:25:36,381
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

1312
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,184
