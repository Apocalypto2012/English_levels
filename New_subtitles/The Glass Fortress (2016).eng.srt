1
00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:14.204
I remember,

2
00:00:14.404 --> 00:00:19.004
or  I think I remember...

3
00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:24.527
Since we left the earth in a hurry,

4
00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:27.595
aboard our spaceship, the Integral,

5
00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:34.604
my mind is so confused, torn apart between reality and fantasy.

6
00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:41.819
How did we manage to escape from the glass city, a cold and shadeless world,

7
00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:45.596
with the other rebels and the woman I love,

8
00:00:45.972 --> 00:00:47.437
my revelation,

9
00:00:47.85 --> 00:00:50.350
Iris.

10
00:00:50.95 --> 00:00:54.542
My name is Daniel, ex D-503,

11
00:00:54.83 --> 00:00:56.170
and I'm a fugitive.

12
00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:42.036
My name was D-503 and this is my story.

13
00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:48.092
I was born some one thousand years after the instauration of the One State.

14
00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.684
The only thing I know about my parents,

15
00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:54.205
is that they were allowed to have a baby,

16
00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:59.390
especially my mother who had to meet the maternal norm.

17
00:02:17.863 --> 00:02:19.344
In the One state,

18
00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:25.497
your hour of birth and gender are the components of you name, or "number".

19
00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:28.565
Consonants for males,

20
00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:31.850
vowels for females.

21
00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:38.848
From birth,

22
00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:42.501
the numbers are immediatly  entrusted to the breeding department,

23
00:02:43.45 --> 00:02:46.736
believed to be more thoughtful and maternal

24
00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.012
than the biological parents.

25
00:02:56.067 --> 00:02:57.826
For the same reason,

26
00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:01.047
young numbers are educated by robots.

27
00:03:01.344 --> 00:03:03.592
One of them was called Plapa,

28
00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.238
as far as I can remember.

29
00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:11.213
I was good at mathematics,

30
00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.987
in the study of train timetables,

31
00:03:22.523 --> 00:03:26.684
and diligent in the performance of my taylor exercices,

32
00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:32.275
which I particularly liked for personal reasons.

33
00:03:42.182 --> 00:03:46.237
As a child, my future was already written,

34
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:50.080
like the predictable trajectory of a planet.

35
00:03:50.456 --> 00:03:54.034
Following the expectations the One State had place in me,

36
00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:57.527
I became a highly skilled engineer.

37
00:03:57.926 --> 00:04:02.552
This growing reputation made me noticed by the Welldoer

38
00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:05.610
who placed me to head up the Integral project.

39
00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:09.360
The  Welldoer is the master of the One State.

40
00:04:10.225 --> 00:04:15.268
He supervises the right and dutiful observance of law and order.

41
00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:39.620
In order to extent the scope of its influence,

42
00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:42.670
our benefactor launched the project Integral,

43
00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:47.909
a spaceship meant to broadcast his message throughout  the universe,

44
00:04:48.04 --> 00:04:51.287
far beyond our solar system's frontiers.

45
00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:23.236
Despite the greatness of my task,

46
00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:28.123
I decided to contribute to the propagation of the One State message

47
00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:31.118
by writing a diary.

48
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:37.621
Besides some intimate comments,

49
00:05:38.054 --> 00:05:40.975
I described my daily life in the city of glass,

50
00:05:41.662 --> 00:05:43.973
in particular the Personal Hours,

51
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:46.858
and the way I used to occupy them.

52
00:05:50.552 --> 00:05:52.578
Sex was important of course.

53
00:05:52.744 --> 00:05:54.305
an hygienic activity

54
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:56.953
freed from love and its drawback.

55
00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:06.791
Promulgated by the One State,

56
00:06:06.798 --> 00:06:09.055
Lex sexualis was as follows:

57
00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:12.019
"A  Number may obtain a license

58
00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:16.718
to use any other Number as a sexual product."

59
00:06:54.841 --> 00:06:57.093
Among other distractions,

60
00:06:57.184 --> 00:06:59.593
I used to go to the musical factory,

61
00:07:00.27 --> 00:07:02.735
walk in the streets of the glass city,

62
00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:05.588
and talk to people.

63
00:07:08.543 --> 00:07:11.842
I didn't know that this pleasant and trivial routine

64
00:07:12.477 --> 00:07:15.872
would forever change the direction of my life...

65
00:07:16.09 --> 00:07:18.610
The first time I met Iris,

66
00:07:18.657 --> 00:07:20.757
ex-I-330,

67
00:07:20.957 --> 00:07:23.196
it started with a laugh.

68
00:07:23.76 --> 00:07:27.913
My laugh strangely echoed by hers...

69
00:08:23.861 --> 00:08:26.422
&lt;i&gt;End of the personal hours in 2 minutes&lt;/i&gt;

70
00:08:27.068 --> 00:08:28.950
Since the Two Hundred Years' War,

71
00:08:29.205 --> 00:08:32.540
not one of us has ever stepped beyond the Green Wall.

72
00:08:33.536 --> 00:08:35.734
An unbreakable crystal belt

73
00:08:35.821 --> 00:08:39.083
which protects the town from total chaos.

74
00:08:39.518 --> 00:08:43.595
Now, it was standing right in front of us.

75
00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:47.802
The green forms filtering through the glass,

76
00:08:47.957 --> 00:08:49.457
shapeless from afar,

77
00:08:49.657 --> 00:08:51.979
proved more accurate closely.

78
00:08:53.215 --> 00:08:56.971
You could distinguish some ridiculous and anarchic form

79
00:08:57.696 --> 00:09:00.414
cut off from our perfect geometry.

80
00:09:00.946 --> 00:09:04.740
Let me show you the way through the Wall of glass,

81
00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:06.197
D-503.

82
00:09:06.213 --> 00:09:08.987
she whispered into my ear...

83
00:09:09.199 --> 00:09:11.072
&lt;i&gt;End of the personal hours&lt;/i&gt;

84
00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:40.998
I-330 took me to a house,

85
00:09:41.442 --> 00:09:43.077
by the green wall.

86
00:09:43.36 --> 00:09:47.140
This house, said to be the one of an old poet,

87
00:09:47.369 --> 00:09:49.144
was from the ancien times,

88
00:09:49.29 --> 00:09:50.997
long before the war.

89
00:09:51.585 --> 00:09:53.257
A kind of country manor,

90
00:09:53.76 --> 00:09:55.986
made of opaque stones and tiles.

91
00:09:57.478 --> 00:09:59.227
Symbol of the dark times,

92
00:09:59.582 --> 00:10:02.698
the building had been sheltered under a dome of glass,

93
00:10:03.087 --> 00:10:05.388
for the interest of a few people,

94
00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:08.653
endowed with the appropriate understanding.

95
00:10:09.997 --> 00:10:12.440
The entrance was kept by an old lady

96
00:10:12.738 --> 00:10:16.011
who was enjoying the last beams of the sunset.

97
00:10:16.932 --> 00:10:19.896
Her face had as many wrinkles

98
00:10:20.16 --> 00:10:23.155
as there were cracks on the roughcast wall behind her.

99
00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:28.733
"Go all by yourself" she whispered,

100
00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:32.842
after sending a wink to I-330...

101
00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:02.484
Then we took off our uniforms,

102
00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:05.961
and decided to do the same with our number.

103
00:12:06.635 --> 00:12:09.443
Get rid even for a  moment

104
00:12:09.455 --> 00:12:12.096
of these alphanumeric identifications...

105
00:12:16.417 --> 00:12:19.340
In your eyes, in your arms,

106
00:12:19.888 --> 00:12:22.272
I'm dissolving in you, Iris.

107
00:12:22.567 --> 00:12:25.706
I am the universe.

108
00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:29.082
She answered:

109
00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:31.855
“Hush my love, I knew you

110
00:12:32.652 --> 00:12:36.456
I knew it even before we met."

111
00:12:36.67 --> 00:12:40.593
"Take me far away in your cosmic dreams, Daniel..."

112
00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:47.299
Later,

113
00:12:47.663 --> 00:12:49.320
Iris showed me the book she had picked up earlier

114
00:12:49.362 --> 00:12:52.162
on a wooden shelf

115
00:12:52.262 --> 00:12:54.428
in the reading room of the house.

116
00:12:55.064 --> 00:12:56.325
A rabbit,

117
00:12:56.755 --> 00:12:58.461
a dizzying hole,

118
00:12:58.758 --> 00:13:00.723
a strange green potion,

119
00:13:01.18 --> 00:13:02.560
a key,

120
00:13:02.697 --> 00:13:03.882
a door,

121
00:13:03.982 --> 00:13:05.471
a passage...

122
00:13:06.222 --> 00:13:08.826
What puzzling non sense!

123
00:13:11.993 --> 00:13:13.797
If the book was the door,

124
00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:16.719
then the green liquor was the key.

125
00:13:37.141 --> 00:13:40.038
An unusual warmth flowed into my veins...

126
00:13:42.36 --> 00:13:44.337
For the first time in my life,

127
00:13:44.39 --> 00:13:49.631
I was abandoning myself and feeling my strange otherness.

128
00:13:51.394 --> 00:13:54.229
Like when I look at my own reflection in a mirror,

129
00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:56.892
a reversed myself.

130
00:14:21.631 --> 00:14:23.689
"Come with me" she said,

131
00:14:23.94 --> 00:14:25.679
"you are now ready..."

132
00:14:40.688 --> 00:14:42.943
We entered an endless corridor.

133
00:14:43.895 --> 00:14:47.603
Water was dripping somewhere upon a stone.

134
00:14:51.261 --> 00:14:52.634
For a second,

135
00:14:52.646 --> 00:14:54.428
I was my former self,

136
00:14:55.357 --> 00:14:59.216
horrified at the thought of what could be at the end of this dark passage.

137
00:15:03.324 --> 00:15:07.704
Then, an intense light submerged us...

138
00:15:15.405 --> 00:15:19.113
Now, we have simply come out beyond the Green Wall.

139
00:15:19.597 --> 00:15:21.629
I opened my eyes,

140
00:15:21.959 --> 00:15:24.434
and close to me, actually,

141
00:15:24.463 --> 00:15:26.105
I saw those very things

142
00:15:26.179 --> 00:15:31.110
which until then not a single living Number had ever seen

143
00:15:31.411 --> 00:15:36.233
except dimmed and hazy through the cloudy glass of the Wall.

144
00:15:36.841 --> 00:15:38.165
The sun.

145
00:15:38.522 --> 00:15:42.082
It was no longer our light

146
00:15:42.362 --> 00:15:45.762
evenly diffused over the mirror surface of the pavements.

147
00:15:46.662 --> 00:15:50.216
It seemed an accumulation of living fragments

148
00:15:50.268 --> 00:15:53.228
of incessantly oscillating dizzy spots

149
00:15:53.668 --> 00:15:56.111
which blinded the eyes.

150
00:16:09.653 --> 00:16:10.758
Under my foot,

151
00:16:11.42 --> 00:16:14.140
the ground was not a perfect flat surface

152
00:16:14.372 --> 00:16:16.772
made of cold glass.

153
00:16:16.872 --> 00:16:19.389
It was soft and warm.

154
00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:23.315
And the trees,

155
00:16:23.53 --> 00:16:26.820
like candles rising into the very sky,

156
00:16:27.062 --> 00:16:30.643
or like spiders that squatted upon the earth.

157
00:16:35.491 --> 00:16:37.741
It is such a lovely day...

158
00:17:54.558 --> 00:17:58.548
"At night all the Numbers must sleep"

159
00:18:10.127 --> 00:18:14.047
"Dreaming is a serious mental disease"

160
00:18:41.691 --> 00:18:46.314
"Sleeping at night is a duty, like work"

161
00:18:58.922 --> 00:19:02.635
"Not to sleep at night is criminal"

162
00:19:08.892 --> 00:19:13.203
"Take us away in your ship, D-503..."

163
00:19:19.448 --> 00:19:21.393
My unkown readers,

164
00:19:21.523 --> 00:19:23.769
can you hear this torrent of lava

165
00:19:23.857 --> 00:19:26.393
rumbling underneath an extinct volcano?

166
00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:29.806
This is exactly what I feel.

167
00:19:30.347 --> 00:19:34.170
Will I carry on cristallising in an eternal mineral death,

168
00:19:34.814 --> 00:19:38.897
or finish in an unexpected magnificent explosion,

169
00:19:39.892 --> 00:19:42.759
full of motion and colours?

170
00:19:57.814 --> 00:20:00.559
The Welldoer doesn't draw its power from god,

171
00:20:00.569 --> 00:20:02.298
or an elected chamber.

172
00:20:02.746 --> 00:20:05.906
His strenght is rooted in the Unanimity of the Numbers.

173
00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:09.038
Highlight of the year,

174
00:20:09.378 --> 00:20:12.559
election day has finally come.

175
00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:17.384
It is also the day of the official launch of my spaceship,

176
00:20:17.879 --> 00:20:19.665
the Integral.

177
00:20:20.373 --> 00:20:22.594
The spokesman announced to all the Numbers

178
00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:24.954
gathered in perfect lines:

179
00:20:25.513 --> 00:20:28.340
"It is Unanimity day today,

180
00:20:28.746 --> 00:20:31.393
the annual election of our Welldoer.

181
00:20:32.283 --> 00:20:36.224
Those in favor shall lift their hands"

182
00:20:36.875 --> 00:20:39.976
For the first time in the history of the One State,

183
00:20:40.398 --> 00:20:43.847
several  hundred of Numbers didn't lift their hands.

184
00:20:44.766 --> 00:20:47.403
They clenched their fists instead...

185
00:21:45.418 --> 00:21:47.209
The following morning,

186
00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:49.467
everything seemed back to "normal",

187
00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:53.190
if this qualifier only makes sense to me now.

188
00:21:54.547 --> 00:21:57.689
But what could have been the awakening of a bad dream

189
00:21:58.199 --> 00:22:01.063
was in fact my reality.

190
00:22:06.057 --> 00:22:09.336
Like many others, I got caught.

191
00:22:10.929 --> 00:22:15.553
Luckily, Iris managed to escape.

192
00:22:15.981 --> 00:22:19.216
Where are you my loved one...?

193
00:22:39.761 --> 00:22:43.509
The One State prosecutor recited my sentence,

194
00:22:43.533 --> 00:22:47.594
if not emotionaly then at least with conviction.

195
00:22:49.422 --> 00:22:55.893
"I deem it my duty to testify that Number D-503 is ill

196
00:22:56.309 --> 00:22:59.523
and is unable to regulate his emotions.

197
00:23:00.132 --> 00:23:04.365
His imagination must be removed at once."

198
00:23:05.789 --> 00:23:06.936
Obviously,

199
00:23:07.205 --> 00:23:09.439
they had gathered sufficient proof

200
00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:12.961
to start my operation without further delay.

201
00:24:47.372 --> 00:24:49.928
Then, Iris appeared to me

202
00:24:49.989 --> 00:24:52.575
like an angel of the ancient times.

203
00:25:01.024 --> 00:25:02.471
She said:

204
00:25:02.948 --> 00:25:06.158
"Take us away in your ship, Daniel..."

205
00:25:44.214 --> 00:25:46.141
As we were on our way to Venus,

206
00:25:46.493 --> 00:25:48.734
the on-board computer asked me :

207
00:25:49.515 --> 00:25:53.344
"Waiting for your instructions  D-503."

208
00:25:53.606 --> 00:25:55.755
I simply answered :

209
00:25:56.189 --> 00:25:58.998
My name is Daniel.

210
00:26:02.091 --> 00:26:05.300
My name is Daniel.

211
00:26:06.986 --> 00:26:10.544
My name is Daniel...

212
00:26:28.664 --> 00:26:31.587
My name is Daniel.
