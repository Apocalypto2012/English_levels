00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:42,500
- Stop it. It's a good thing.
- (CHUCKLES)

347
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,083
- I need your help.
- My help?

348
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:48,958
Yeah, with this, you know,
this peace summit.

349
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:54,292
You're the best diplomat
the Skrulls have ever had.

350
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,375
I'm no good with people. You are.

351
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:00,417
- You've got your own way.
- Yeah, well, I'm sick of it.

352
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,583
And we're better together.

353
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:05,292
Well, at least, I am.

354
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:11,208
Please, come with me.

355
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,083
VARRA: I'll help you get started.

356
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:23,792
But then I've gotta get back.

357
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,500
All my work is here, darling.

358
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:28,750
And it's never been more important.

359
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,292
I just wanted to tell you that...

360
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:46,833
That I love you.

361
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,958
As I am.

362
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:59,042
Only as you are.
