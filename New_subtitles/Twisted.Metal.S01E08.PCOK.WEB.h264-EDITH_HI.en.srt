- At least they're
having a good time.

182
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,118
- Uh, he's not.

183
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,411
- Holy shit!

184
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:37,912
Maybe he deserved it.

185
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:41,916
- I didn't.

186
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,127
- Cool. I hate this place.

187
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:46,421
- [Goddess Janice]
Kiss my leather!

188
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,839
[yelping]

189
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,091
- [Holy Man] We worship you!
- [Janice] Bend down.

190
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,218
[yelping]

191
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:54,887
- Okay, Evelyn
has to be here.

192
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,305
So, just blend in
with these freaks

193
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:57,598
until we find her.

194
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,434
- Damn, very flexible.

195
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:01,728
Oh, shit!
Uh, uh...

196
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,354
Oh, bullocks.

197
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:05,273
- Who told you to speak?

198
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,442
- Agh!

199
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,026
- You like pain?

200
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:12,613
- I love it so much,
me lady!

201
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:14,615
- Damn.
- Good.

202
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:16,617
- Ow.

203
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:18,953
- The Goddess is pleased.
[groaning]

204
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:20,747
Cupbearer?
- [Cupbearer] Yes, Goddess?

205
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,957
- Bring forth libations.

206
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:26,961
- Here.

207
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:29,922
It's chug-a-lug time!

208
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,257
- All chanting:
Chug-a-lug!

209
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:35,261
Chug-a-lug!
Chug-a-lug! Chug-a-lug!

210
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:39,724
[sighing]

211
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,225
[gagging]

212
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:43,644
- Nothing like
a Jack and coke.

213
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,104
- So, wait, why is
it crunchy?

214
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:48,024
- That'd be the coke.
[laughing]

215
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:49,484
- It's Preacher.
- It's Preacher.

216
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:50,818
- The preacher's here.

217
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,029
[hootin' and hollerin']

218
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:58,034
- [Holy Man]
I love you, preacher.

219
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:00,620
- [Holy Man] Absolve my sins!

220
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,954
- I think the coke
is kicking in.

221
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,414
- I can't feel my throat.

222
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:05,249
- I'm gonna shit myself.

223
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,712
[groaning]
- [Preacher] Night, night.

224
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:12,090
[laughing]

225
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:14,759
Which one of you
blessed fucks

226
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:17,387
had seven days
in the death pool?

227
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:22,016
Blessings on you, Krevin!
[chuckles]

228
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:24,477
Victory runs
in your veins.

229
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,356
Go on, reward him!

230
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:30,775
- Here you go.
- [Preacher] Okay.

231
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:32,193
- Enjoy.

232
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:34,362
- Gods and Goddesses,

233
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:37,907
it is my honor
to be with you again

234
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:42,078
here in Colorado
for our annual pilgrimage,

235
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,956
The Rocky Mountain
Fuck Fest!

236
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:47,542
[laughing, cheering]

237
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,880
Now, while we are indulging
in the seven deadly delights,

238
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:55,091
let us recall
our past

239
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:58,010
and celebrate
our futures!

240
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:01,806
Me? I was a man of God.

241
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:04,392
Shit, I was even celibate.

242
00:12:04,434 --> 00:12:06,060
[laughing]

243
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:07,562
Shut the fuck up, Krevin.

244
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:08,813
- Oh, okay.

245
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:11,399
- But when the world ended,

246
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:15,361
God was nowhere
to be found.

247
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:19,323
And I thought, huh!
This fucker's forsaken us.

248
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:23,369
Right? But then
I realized, no!

249
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,206
We are the gods!

250
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,834
Always have been,
always will be.

251
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,044
[hootin' and hollerin']

252
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:35,339
And the roads will be
forever our domain!

253
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:38,801
[cheering]

254
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:42,055
[laughter]

255
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:43,389
- Great crowd work.

256
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:44,766
- I can hear you
grinding your teeth.

257
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,434
- Dude, that's you!

258
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:47,602
[laughing]

259
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,604
- Now...

260
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,440
what gifts did you
motherfuckers bring me?

261
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:55,693
Ooh, is that
a generator I see?

262
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:58,946
Okay.
Uh, gasoline, got it.

263
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:01,783
Okay, guns.
Guns, drugs.

264
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:05,620
Okay, guys, you gotta get
more creative than just drugs.

265
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:06,871
- Here you go, Preacher.

266
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:09,540
- Okay, that's just
more drugs, Jeff.

267
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:11,167
That's just more drugs.

268
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:14,796
[Evelyn approaching]

269
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,507
Well, now everybody
shut the fuck up!

270
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:20,635
Hold on! Oh-ho-ho!

271
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:23,429
Holy shit!

272
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:27,517
- Hey, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

273
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,812
John!
- A token for you, Preacher.

274
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:35,650
- What a hot
piece of ass!

275
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,778
Ooh-ooh-ooh.

276
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,697
[inhales deeply]

277
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,658
I should lube up
with oil

278
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,701
and dick your muffler.

279
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:48,329
- [Holy Men] Dick her muff!
Dick her muff!

280
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:51,249
Dick her muff!
Dick her muff!

281
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,376
- Don't touch her!

282
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:56,337
- Who spoke?

283
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:07,682
[chuckling]

284
00:14:07,724 --> 00:14:12,061
Your tone sounded...
envious.

285
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:14,272
I like that.

286
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:18,109
You want her, don't you?

287
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:20,445
- Say no. Say no.
Say no. Say no.

288
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:24,907
- From one brother
to another,

289
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:26,868
I propose a clash.

290
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,203
[exasperated groan]

291
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:31,581
- Oh, yeah.

292
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:35,043
[chuckling]

293
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:42,091
[collective chatter]

294
00:14:45,303 --> 00:14:47,680
- Are you ready, son?

295
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:50,266
[chuckling]

296
00:14:50,308 --> 00:14:52,351
[sniffling]

297
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,022
- So, what's your plan
here, stud?

298
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:57,231
- Have you seen this guy?

299
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,816
A strong wind
can blow him over.

300
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:01,152
I'm gonna kick his ass so bad
I'm gonna be their king.

301
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:02,320
- That's the blow talking!

302
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:05,364
[screaming]

303
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:06,949
Oh, God!

304
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:09,368
[laughing]

305
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:13,372
Oof, Coke Jesus
has a right hook!

306
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:16,042
- I heard something crack.
I think it was my brain.

307
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:18,503
- Listen up, he's fast,
so keep your distance.

308
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,421
You'll never get a good hit in
if you're too close.

309
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:22,507
Honestly...
- I told you I got this.

310
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,467
Hit me.
- [Quiet] What? John?

311
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,677
Fine, you're on your own.

312
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:28,721
[laughter]
- [Preacher] Let's eat this guy!

313
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,890
- Surprise!
- Ah, my eyes!

314
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:33,684
[grunting, groaning]

315
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:36,771
- [Holy Men] Ooh!

316
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,981
- Stay the fuck down,
Preach!

317
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:42,693
[laughing]

318
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:44,362
- Whoo!

319
00:15:44,404 --> 00:15:46,364
You ever drink
your own blood?

320
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:48,533
It's intoxicating.

321
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,412
- What the f... Oh!

322
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:54,539
[manic laughter]

323
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,873
Are you possessed?

324
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:59,377
- I was once.
By a little demon baby.

325
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:02,296
Fucker made me kill
a whole church of people.

326
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,590
Here we go!

327
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:07,093
I can still hear
their screams.

328
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:09,429
I can't wait
to hear yours!

329
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,349
[grunting, groaning]

330
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:15,059
I can't stop kicking!

331
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:17,019
- He's doing really well.

332
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,605
- Heh...

333
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,899
[electricity crackling]

334
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:24,861
- [Preacher] The Holy Ghost
lives through me.

335
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,406
What should I do?
Should I eat this guy?

336
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:30,324
Should I fuck this guy?

337
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:32,535
[grunting]
Dirt nap!

338
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:40,126
[whistles]

339
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,670
- Get on your knees,
you greasy little piglet

340
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:46,090
and lick
my soiled boots.

341
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:49,093
- Oh! Yes, goddess.

342
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:51,095
Please, goddess.

343
00:16:51,137 --> 00:16:52,805
[whimpering]

344
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,270
- Now, where are the keys
to that car, vermin?

345
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:01,689
I wanna take it
for a ride.

346
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:05,109
- Wait! Goddesses
only ride shotgun.

347
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,612
That is our way.

348
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:08,780
- Not my way!

349
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:11,991
[groaning]
- Yes, please!

350
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:14,118
[screaming]

351
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,787
- Oh, where are you going?

352
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:17,663
[grunting]

353
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,504
[manic laughter]

354
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:29,634

[cheers, manic laughter]

358
00:17:55,868 --> 00:18:00,456
Yes! Yes!
[laughter]

359
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:02,333
Take him to the cross!
