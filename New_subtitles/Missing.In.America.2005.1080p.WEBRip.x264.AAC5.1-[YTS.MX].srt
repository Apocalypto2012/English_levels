Oh yes sir, you can,
you most certainly can.

550
00:43:46,847 --> 00:43:50,283
We got some dead cow,

551
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:52,410
a chicken or two.

552
00:43:52,486 --> 00:43:55,717

Goddamn it,
look at all this food.

556
00:44:13,474 --> 00:44:15,819
It never crossed my mind that
any of you'd have a woman.

557
00:44:16,944 --> 00:44:18,070
She's welcome too.

558
00:44:18,145 --> 00:44:20,079
Oh, well, uh...

559
00:44:20,147 --> 00:44:23,014
Cyd, she don't like
to leave the house much.

560
00:44:23,084 --> 00:44:25,765
- Mind if I bring one of these back to her?
- Oh, help yourself.

561
00:44:26,554 --> 00:44:30,615
Hey, Dinky,
get your arse out here!

562
00:44:32,393 --> 00:44:34,054
Chickenshit!

563
00:44:34,128 --> 00:44:36,828
Probably slobbering
all over himself from the smell,

564
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,831
but he hasn't got the guts
to come out on his own.

565
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:40,255
How many more of you
are out here?

566
00:44:40,257 --> 00:44:44,139
Around here?
Well, there's, uh, Dinky and

567
00:44:44,562 --> 00:44:47,981
Red and, oh and then there's
some other vets out in the deep woods,

568
00:44:47,983 --> 00:44:49,648
we trade with them
every once in a while.

569
00:44:50,878 --> 00:44:53,346
Dinky!

570
00:44:53,414 --> 00:44:54,890
Come and get a brewsky!

571
00:44:57,151 --> 00:44:58,151
Oh, there he is.

Oh, no, no, he was running down an elk

574
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:08,051
fell and busted his leg,
he set it hisself but, uh,

575
00:45:08,129 --> 00:45:09,654
it never did mend right,
did it, Dink?

583
00:45:29,183 --> 00:45:30,218
Kid of a buddy of mine.

584
00:45:32,389 --> 00:45:33,542
Looks like a gook.

585
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:34,821
Yeah.

586
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:37,197
Her real name is Lee.

587
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:40,011
She was born in uh...
her mom was a gook.

588

were in Vietnam too.

He's as crazy as they come!

Oh, don't shake
her arm off, Dink.

599
00:46:16,688 --> 00:46:19,479
She could be my granddaughter.

Sure is a pretty
little thing, ain't she?

601
00:46:23,037 --> 00:46:25,974
Less talk and I've
got to get me a beer.

602
00:46:27,495 --> 00:46:28,495
You know,

603
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:30,512
you and Lenny
should come and meet my wife.

604
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,195
She was a nursing nun,

605
00:46:32,546 --> 00:46:34,614
used to hang out at
them orphanages and shit.

606
00:46:34,824 --> 00:46:36,634
I got a lot of respect
for nurses.

607
00:46:38,828 --> 00:46:40,045
So, who's Red?

608
00:46:40,637 --> 00:46:41,976
Red? Well...

609
00:46:42,578 --> 00:46:44,179
...he's one of us, sort of, uh,

610
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:45,793
...he lives closest
to your place.

611
00:46:47,495 --> 00:46:50,026
He's watching us right now,
you can bet on that.

612
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,731
Can you get him to come out?

613
00:46:56,325 --> 00:46:57,388
Maybe... maybe not.

614
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:01,300
He's, uh, got
kind of a short fuse.

615
00:47:02,385 --> 00:47:03,503
Gotta be careful with him.

616
00:47:03,911 --> 00:47:07,292
He's got so many booby traps around this
place I don't even go over there anymore.

Oh no, that's true enough.

620
00:47:15,741 --> 00:47:18,341
I don't think he heard us
talking about your little girl there, so

621
00:47:18,343 --> 00:47:19,585
it should be all right.

622
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:21,639
Is she a problem?

623
00:47:22,185 --> 00:47:23,185

Oh, yeah.

631
00:48:00,267 --> 00:48:03,015
He don't talk any.
That's just the way he is.

632
00:48:03,773 --> 00:48:05,299
Might be he don't have much to say.

00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:07,287
That could be but

634
00:48:08,376 --> 00:48:10,910
funny thing is I ain't
never heard Red make a sound.

635
