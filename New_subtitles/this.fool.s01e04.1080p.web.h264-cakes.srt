1
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,025
Tsk.

2
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,791
Shh.

3
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:45,855
I need your help.

4
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,632
But in order to help me,
I need you to be sneaky.

5
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,486
- Are you two little fools sneaky?
- Yes.

6
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,470
- How sneaky?
- Very sneaky.

7
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,597
Okay, then.

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,786
I need you to go out back
and blow up these fireworks.

9
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,830
- You can do that for your tío Julio?
- Yeah.

10
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:02,997
You know how to use a lighter?

11
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:03,998
- Yeah.
- You do?

12
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,458
- Yeah.
- Okay, here.

13
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,802
Alright, get the hell outta here.

14
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,662
¡Niños!

15
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,938
- Hey, perro. What was that sound?
- That shit woke me up.

16
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:27,963
Oh, shit, uh...

17
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,483
I don't know.
You should probably go check it out.

18
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,508
I gotta bounce.

19
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,403
Why? Where you going? What's the rush?

20
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,012
- Luis, just move!
- No, hold up.

21
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,786
Julio! Did you give
my fucking kids fireworks?

22
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,547
Motherfucker!

23
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,091
- Fuck you.
- Get your ass back here!

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,801
Julio!

25
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,306
Tres leches.

26
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,974
Julio.

27
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,727
Julio.

28
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,582
Wah, wah.

29
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:58,011
It's funny. Nobody did anything
for my birthday last week.

30
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,830
Hey, what's Julio's problem?

31
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,541
I would have killed to have celebrated
my birthday while I was locked up.

32
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,251
He's not happy with where he's at in life

33
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,502
because he doesn't know what he wants,

34
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,212
and so he, like, hates himself for it.

35
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,964
So instead of celebrating his birthday,

36
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,174
he literally thinks he deserves to suffer.

37
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,342
Okay.

38
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,510
I'm gonna make sure he suffers

39
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,262
by celebrating
the shit out of his birthday.

40
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,972
Good luck finding him.

41
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,557
Every birthday he disappears all day.

42
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,559
I bet he even called in sick to work.

43
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,811
- Pinche huevón.
- Hey, hey.

44
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,235
Maybe he's out doing something fun.

45
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,725
Good morning, Mr. Lopez.

46
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,437
I, uh, I'm reviewing your paperwork here,

47
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,231
and I noticed a little mistake.

48
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,840
It says here that it's your birthday.

49
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,736
Oh, uh, it's not a mistake.

50
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,053
Today is my birthday.

51
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,867
Oh. Well, in that case,
we should reschedule.

52
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,619
You shouldn't have to be here
on your birthday.

53
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:30,521
- Oh, no, that's okay.
- Thanks for offering, though.

54
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,416
- You sure?
- Yeah.

55
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,567
I specifically scheduled this for today.

56
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,779
- You wanna be here?
- I wanna be here.

57
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,823
- Oh. Okay.
- Yeah.

58
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,389
Mr. Lopez, then I guess, uh, open wide.

59
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,498
Yeah.

60
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,944
Oh, okay. I just... I can't do this.

61
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,821
I'm sorry. I cannot do this.

62
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,072
But it's your job.

63
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,407
What are you, into BDSM or something?

64
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,784
- No.
- You like getting punished?

65
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,369
- No.
- Naughty birthday boy.

66
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,497
I went to dental school
and they warned me about people like you.

67
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,290
Hey, you wanna get weird
with a doctor?

68
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,650
You go see a podiatrist. Okay?

69
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,194
Don't you ever
come back here again, pervert.

70
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,429
And I'm still charging you for today.

71
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,720
Pervert.

72
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,996
Fuck...

73
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,561
Hey, Minister Payne, what's up?

74
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,020
Fabian got arrested.

75
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,105
For what?

76
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,858
Public nudity at a Jewish temple.

77
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,693
He was screaming to be converted.

78
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:44,487
- What?
- Julio, are you listening to me?

79
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,947
Fabian is tweaking again.

80
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,533
I need you to come down here
and run things

81
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,201
while I work on finding him a good lawyer.

82
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,579
But I specifically took today off.

83
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:53,687
Julio!

84
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,738
Tsk.

85
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,537
Goddamn it.

86
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,543
Oh, hey, Julio.

87
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,839
I hope you're having
a very nice and special day.

88
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,593
Oh, um... for no particular reason.

89
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,513
Thanks. You too.

90
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:36,188
Oh, yeah, I'm making this cake
extra special for this motherfucker.

91
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,083
That fool told me
his birthday was on Christmas.

92
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,668
That's why I didn't buy him anything.

93
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,463
Which is fucked up,
'cause he always go hard for our birthday.

94
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,132
Last year, that motherfucker
got me some fancy-ass soap.

95
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,843
Somehow he knew
the exact kinda soap that I wanted.

96
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:49,969
Shea butter.

97
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,888
He thinks we're a charity case.

98
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,097
Martyr-ass bitch.

99
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,474
Make a wish, bitch.

100
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,476
'Cause your birthday's getting celebrated.

101
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,978
Damn, that cake looks bomb!

102
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,295
Hey, check this shit out.

103
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,177
Julio? Let's get his ass.

104
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,810
Stop right there!

105
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,579
Luis told me everything.

106
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,914
You fuckin' lied to me.

107
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,791
We just wanna celebrate your birthday.

108
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,358
You made me do this.

109
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,652
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

110
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,822
- Come on, get him!
- Go! Go!

111
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,591
What happened?

112
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,118
He fucking bit me,
bit right through the fabric.

113
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,911
Let's get his ass!

114
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,421
Where do you think you're going, man?

115
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,381
Get out, homey.

116
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,080
What the fuck is wrong with them?

117
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,271
Time to eat your cake, birthday bitch!

118
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,036
Hold this.

119
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,752
This isn't over, motherfucker.

120
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,453
- Maggie?
- Shouldn't leave your window unlocked.

121
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,955
There's a lot of perverts
and sick fucks out there.

122
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,624
You didn't text me back.

123
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,399
About that earthquake
that didn't happen?

124
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,194
You're so pathetic.

125
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,112
Now move over, loser.

126
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,078
What are you doing here?

127
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,039
- We broke up again.
- I know.

128
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,060
But it's your birthday.
I had to come by and give you your gift.

129
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,711
- I don't want anything.
- Bullshit.

130
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,630
So you think you know me, huh?

131
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,590
I'm the only one who knows you.

132
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,010
And I know exactly what you want.

133
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,096
Oh, yeah? What is that?

134
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,951
You wanna lie here
and stare at the ceiling

135
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,975
and think about how much
you fucking hate yourself.

136
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,542
Because you're 31
and you still live at your mom's house

137
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,252
because you chose a career path

138
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,587
that doesn't lead
to financial independence.

139
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,755
Oh, yeah? Fuck.

140
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,966
And also because you broke up with me,

141
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,302
because you're scared of commitment.

142
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,805
So you're all alone.

143
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,266
Oh, shit, this is good.

144
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,624
But guess what, sucio?

145
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,812
I'm here now, and I'm gonna
let you have your cake and eat it too.

146
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,397
Oh, fuck, yeah.

147
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,232
So we're just gonna lie here

148
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:53,486
and be fucking miserable all night long!

149
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,596
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, yeah!

150
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,225
Whoa.

151
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,394
You feel that earthquake?

152
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,736
Hey, Julio, it's me.

153
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,030
Fuckin' leave me alone.

154
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,550
I'm sorry that I told everybody
it was your birthday.

155
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,468
I know you don't like
to make a big deal out of it,

156
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,786
but, you know, you've done
a lot to help me out.

157
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,307
I know you had good intentions.

158
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,892
It's all good.

159
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,602
Hey, listen, I really think

160
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:26,936
you should come out tonight.

161
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,587
I promise we'll do it up right, primo.

162
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,857
I'd rather kick it by myself.

163
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,317
Come on, dawg.

164
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,610
We don't even gotta go out anywhere.

165
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,445
Just come out and have a pisto with me.

166
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,429
You didn't hear me? I said no!

167
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,450
Alright, then, you fuckin' pussy.

168
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,475
Have it your way.

169
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,007
What the fuck?

170
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,074
What the fuck?

171
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,451
- Get him, homeys, get him!
- No! No!

172
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,620
- Watch out, that fool bites.
- Get the fuck off me!

173
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,830
His teeth are fucked up,
but they're strong!

174
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,164
No! No!

175
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,773
Respect my birthday wishes!

176
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,261
Leave me the fuck alone! No!

177
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,578
No! No!

178
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,603
Surprise!

179
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,796
You're at a bowling alley, bitch.

180
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,067
You ready for the best fuckin' birthday
of your life, primo?

181
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,651
Come on, tell the homey your shoe size.

182
00:11:58,844 --> 00:11:59,845
Three.

183
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:01,930
Don't be stupid.

184
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,985
Come on, Luis.

185
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,740
Yeah, homey!

186
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,136
- Get in here.
- No, you can do it. You can do it.

187
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,286
Julio!

188
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,333
Come on.

189
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,253
Wah!

190
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,049
Oh! Oh, shit.

191
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,779
Feliz cumpleaños, buddy.

192
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,199
Chili cheese fry.

193
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,743
- I'm good. No, thanks.
- Your loss.

194
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,579
Hey.

195
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,225
I get that you hate your birthday,

196
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:13,377
but you should be happy
there are people who wanna celebrate you.

197
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,313
You've made a difference in their lives.

198
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,065
They're better people because of you.

199
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:19,359
Oh, damn, oh, I'm pregnant.

200
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,759
Ay, Mira, look, it's a baby Julio.

201
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,554
Bitch.

202
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,599
You're totally right.

203
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,662
I need to change my attitude.
How about this?

204
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,665
I'll stop being a little bitch
if you bowl a round with me.

205
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:36,417
Loser has to lead group hug tomorrow.

206
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,503
Oh, game on, bitch.

207
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:41,005
- I'll go get us another round.
- No, no, no.

208
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,758
- It's your birthday. Drinks are on me.
- Uh! I insist.

209
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,158
I fuckin' bit you.

210
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,495
Fair enough. You did break the skin.

211
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,458
What can I say, I'm blessed, I'm blessed.

212
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,465
Can I get my shoes back?

213
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:01,985
Twenty dollars.

214
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,319
What?

215
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,737
Birthday boy who hates his birthday,

216
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,447
trying to skip out on his own party?

217
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,639
I've seen it a million times.

218
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,100
Give me $20,
I'll give you your shoes back.

219
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,644
Goddamn it.

220
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,772
Happy birthday.

221
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,294
Maggie?

222
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,462
- Oh, shit.
- Let me guess.

223
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,322
Luis invited you
to this stupid thing, huh?

224
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,282
What stupid thing?

225
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:28,869
Who the fuck is this?

226
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:33,373
Th... This... This is my date.

227
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,876
Hey, what's up, man? Cool shoes.

228
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:41,340
This guy is my friend Julio Lopez.

229
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,801
Hey, cool name, bro. I'm Julio Tambien.

230
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,095
Oh, great. Another Julio?

231
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:49,532
What's your last name?

232
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,184
I just told you, bro. It's Tambien.

233
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,770
What kinda stupid-ass last name is that?

234
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,563
I dunno.

235
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,545
How was I supposed to know
you'd be here?

236
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,797
You usually just stay at home
and stare at the ceiling on your birthday.

237
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,050
You don't know me
as well as you think you do.

238
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,801
I'm actually having
a fuckin' blast right now.

239
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,262
You were just trying
to escape your own party.

240
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,848
- I don't wanna argue on my birthday.
- It's a special day.

241
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,976
- Aw.
- Also, how'd you meet that fool?

242
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,729
- I met him at a work event for my firm.
- He's a lawyer.

243
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,232
A lawyer? Pfft. What a douche.

244
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,900
An international human rights lawyer.

245
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,676
Oh, what a great guy.

246
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,487
- Fuck off.
- Ugh.

247
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,697
Isn't there like a law against
dating one of your coworkers?

248
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:33,034
It's funny how you work at a law firm
and I know more about the law than you.

249
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,452
Oh, my God, just shut up, okay?

250
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,895
Look, I am happy to go somewhere else.

251
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,791
- I fucking hate bowling.
- No. Just stay.

252
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:42,085
We're all adults here. I'm 31 now.

253
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:45,195
Mature enough to handle this
complicated situation with ease.

254
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:49,133
Okay. If that's what you really want.

255
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:52,119
- Yeah.
- Hey, babe. Let's go bowl.

256
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,431
Hey. Nice meeting you, Julio Lopez.

257
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,249
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

258
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,173
Game on, Tambien.

259
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,389
- Thank you.
- Let's fuckin' do this.

260
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:15,309
Oh. Oh.

261
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:19,789
Hey, my boy.

262
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,749
Maggie's there with some other fool.

263
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,774
I know.

264
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,425
Well, how does that make you feel?

265
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:29,114
It's my birthday. I feel fucking great.

266
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,427
That's right, my boy!

267
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,869
Welcome to the party!

268
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,292
Nice job there, gutter boy.

269
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:45,380
Damn.

270
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,748
Just nice and easy.

271
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,065
Okay.

272
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,859
Hey, it's your turn, fool, come on.

273
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,664
Whoa!

274
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,775
Final frame. Two pins to win.

275
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,509
You got this, Lopez.

276
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,262
Fuck you, Tambien.

277
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,192
Fuck.

278
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,571
Damn, Manuela's
not doing too good, huh?

279
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,000
Maybe you should throw in the towel
'cause Payne already crushed you.

280
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,411
Can't let that fool win.

281
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,997
Guess I gotta use the other Manuela.

282
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,586
Right. But what I was saying was
is you already lost, you know, so...

283
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:37,951
Whoo!

284
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,207
Yeah!

285
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,789
Woo-hoo-hoo!

286
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,519
Did you just stick
your dirty motherfuckin' face

287
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,395
into my beautiful motherfuckin' cake?

288
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,398
You're supposed to let other people
push your head into the cake.

289
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,442
Maybe it's better
you don't celebrate your birthday.

290
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,146
I don't think you know how to do it right.

291
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:37,845
Go wash your face off.

292
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,057
You ruined your birthday for us.

293
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,789
Why the fuck are you
acting like such a tool?

294
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:49,749
Hey, this is for men only.

295
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,459
Hey, you're a fucking idiot.

296
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,920
You're just mad
I beat your boyfriend's ass at bowling.

297
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:55,421
Guess I'm still Julio number one.

298
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,215
You can't beat someone
you're not playing.

299
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,466
That's not how shit works.

300
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,130
You could have at least texted me back.

301
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:04,556
Why? Did you want to hang out with me?

302
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:09,352
No. It's just friends should
text friends back on their birthdays.

303
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,586
Just admit it.

304
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,212
You miss me.

305
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:13,964
I didn't say that.

306
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:20,012
Stop being such a little bitch
and admit what you want.

307
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,598
I don't want shit from you.

308
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:24,808
I know what you want.

309
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:30,230
You wanna kiss me right here
in this dirty-ass bathroom.

310
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,149
Admit it, slut.

311
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,943
Okay. I miss you. There.

312
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,029
And?

313
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,781
And I wanna kiss you
in this dirty-ass bathroom.

314
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,038
Congrats, birthday boy.

315
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,165
You finally said what you want.

316
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,292
You're growing up.

317
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,212
Sapo verde, bitch!

318
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:16,693
Do not eat the chili cheese fries.

319
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,404
Tell everyone.
