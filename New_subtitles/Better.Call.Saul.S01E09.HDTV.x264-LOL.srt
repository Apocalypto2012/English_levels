1
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,431
Don't worry about that, all right?

2
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:39,183
Look down. Look at the grass.

3
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:43,854
Kick off your shoes like this.

4
00:00:54,073 --> 00:00:56,534
When was the last time you did that?

5
00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:58,828
Feels good, right?

6
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:01,372
Yeah.

7
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:03,999
Grass between your toes.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,169
Feels nice.

9
00:01:07,378 --> 00:01:09,130
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:18,222
Well, I think maybe...
Maybe it's time we go in.

11
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:23,227
We got a lot of work to do. We need
to get ready. You need to get ready.

12
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:26,773
If I were Schweikart and Cokely,
I'd seek a restraining order.

13
00:01:27,816 --> 00:01:29,818
Turn this into a civil harassment issue.

14
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:33,195
Schweikart and Cokely can come
after me with a restraining order...

15
00:01:33,404 --> 00:01:35,406
or anything else they got, I'll be ready.

16
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:37,450
Confidence is good.

17
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:40,328
Facts on your side, better.

18
00:01:40,787 --> 00:01:43,038
Know what you're walking into.

19
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:06,228
- House needs a coat of paint.
- Yeah.

20
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,500
<b>sync and corrections by othelo
addic7ed.com</b>

21
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:26,467
I got her all her shots.

22
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:29,470
Healthy gums. And no worms. No fleas.

23
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:34,266
I promise you, if the little sucker
has fleas, I'll kick her butt myself.

24
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:37,561
Yeah, it's just, a dog...

25
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,981
Hey, it's good to have a dog around.

26
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,317
Bad guys think twice about
breaking into a house with a dog.

27
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,404
Yeah, I bet that one's gonna
keep a lot of burglars away.

28
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:49,824
It's just a thought.

29
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:54,411
You know, you can always
keep her over at my place.

30
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,165
Kaylee can visit her any time she wants.

31
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:01,961
Well, if you decide to keep her...

32
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,964
I got a giant bag of puppy
chow out in the car for you.

33
00:03:05,173 --> 00:03:08,134
All the supplies. Everything you need.

34
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:15,016
All right.

35
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:17,185
What's that?

36
00:03:18,477 --> 00:03:20,646
The dog can stay here.

37
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:22,356
You sure?

38
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:24,234
Yes.

39
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:26,069
Thank you.

40
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:29,280
All right. Done.

41
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:33,534
Excuse me a minute.

42
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:40,666
Yeah?

43
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:45,421
Sure.

44
00:03:48,258 --> 00:03:49,800
Yup.

45
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,597
Got it.

46
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,023
Is everything okay?

47
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:07,651
Yeah. Just a lead on a job opportunity.

48
00:04:09,028 --> 00:04:12,156
Your Honor, Mr. Schweikart and
his cohorts are attempting...

49
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:14,742
- to keep me away from their victims.
- Victims?

50
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:17,203
My clients. Yes. You're
denying me access.

51
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:22,041
Even the worst prisoners in this
building are allowed access to a lawyer.

52
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,337
Are you saying my poor, elderly clients
have fewer rights than jail inmates?

53
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:29,632
Not at all. And no one is denying
Mr. McGill access to his clients.

54
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,383
- We're denying access to the property.
- It's semantics.

55
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:35,346
Within Sandpiper Crossing's rights.
The building is private property.

56
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:38,766
- Paid for by the residents.
- But managed by licensed professionals.

57
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:40,893
Okay. One at a time, gentlemen.

58
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:45,564
Mr. Schweikart, you're denying
him access on what grounds?

59
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:49,193
These assisted living residents have
a daily routine that they're used to.

60
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:54,448
Mr. McGill, who is loud and flamboyant,
is a disturbance to these routines.

61
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:57,534
Residents who want to see a lawyer,
free to leave whenever they want.

62
00:04:57,743 --> 00:05:02,248
Leave whenever they want? We're talking
about elderly and infirm people here.

63
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:06,794
The most common phrase in this place?
"I've fallen and I can't get up."

64
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:10,006
There's phone consultations.
There's mail and messenger services.

65
00:05:10,214 --> 00:05:12,049
Plenty of ways to confer with clients.

66
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:16,053
But for residents who don't want to be
afflicted with Mr. McGill's presence...

67
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:18,348
this becomes an issue
of civil harassment.

68
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:21,100
Wow, you are stretching
that definition to its limit.

69
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:23,644
And FYI, old people adore me.

70
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:25,062
Okay. I've heard enough.

71
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:28,024
I have enough here to let me
rule on this restraining order.

72
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:36,448
Yeah. Don't worry, Chuck. That's
not smoke you smell. That's me.

73
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:43,039
This mo-fo is on fire. Your baby
bro kicked some Schweikart ass today.

74
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:45,582
What the hell's all this?

75
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,920
There was a delivery
while you were in court.

76
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:52,589
Schweikart and Cokely
sent this? What is it?

77
00:05:52,798 --> 00:05:55,968
The served interrogatories
on each class representative.

78
00:05:56,177 --> 00:05:58,721
This box is deposition notices.

79
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:03,809
Documents calling into question the
mental health of our elderly clients.

80
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:06,478
Attempting to stop the
class from being certified...

81
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:08,522
on the grounds they're not competent.

82
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:10,941
Oh, this is just the beginning.

83
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:15,154
They're gonna continue this document
dump until we're drowning in paperwork.

84
00:06:15,363 --> 00:06:20,492
All right. We can deal
with this. I mean, hey.

85
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:25,039
It's... It's just paperwork. Right?

86
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:28,625
- It's no big deal. Just hit it head on.
- Jimmy.

87
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:31,462
Prioritize. The most
important stuff first.

88
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,965
Or is it better to deal
with the easy stuff?

89
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:37,760
You know, get that off the decks.

90
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:41,638
You tell me, Chuck. You just
point to a box. We can do this.

91
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:44,308
- Jimmy, we need to talk.
- Chuck.

92
00:06:44,516 --> 00:06:47,353
- Sit down, won't you?
- No, I'm good.

93
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:49,980
I know you're not gonna
like what I have to say next.

94
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:51,648
But facts are facts.

95
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:54,193
And what we're facing here...

96
00:06:54,402 --> 00:06:57,905
A case this size, it is not
a two man job. We need help.

97
00:06:58,114 --> 00:07:00,324
- No.
- And for the good of the clients...

98
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:02,701
- we need to refer this case...
- Don't say it.

99
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,661
Refer it out to HHM.

100
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,332
Damn it, Chuck. No. Come on.

101
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,379
We can do this. We're
doing great on our own.

102
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:17,341
We don't need Hamlin or
anyone else. I mean, hey.

103
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:20,636
We can Erin Brockovich
the shit out of this case.

104
00:07:20,844 --> 00:07:23,013
Erin Brockovich didn't do it alone.

105
00:07:23,222 --> 00:07:25,224
She and Ed Masry brought
in heavy hitters...

106
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:28,102
from Los Angeles to get that
case across the goal line.

107
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:32,106
And that's what we need to do.
And there's no shame in that.

108
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:33,774
This is our case.

109
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:37,569
Yes, it's ours. And the
task ahead is monumental.

110
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:40,072
Could we do it alone?

111
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:44,160
Could two men alone build
the Brooklyn Bridge? Maybe.

112
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:46,578
But it would take forever.

113
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:50,416
Just how long do you think the
residents of Sandpiper Crossing have?

114
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:56,630
Referring this case to HHM is
for the good of the clients.

115
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,217
That argument you won today
against the restraining order...

116
00:08:00,426 --> 00:08:02,345
the judge was never gonna grant that.

117
00:08:02,553 --> 00:08:04,847
Schweikart is throwing softballs.

118
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:07,475
And he's gonna keep on
throwing them over and over.

119
00:08:07,683 --> 00:08:11,187
We'll be busy swatting them away, we'll
never spend time on the actual case.

120
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:13,897
This case will span years.

121
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:17,485
And we don't have the capital
to carry it forward by ourselves.

122
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:19,695
We simply don't.

123
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:33,042
- Fine.
- So?

124
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,503
The case goes to HHM?

125
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:41,008
Hail Satan. I submit to the dark side.

126
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:45,012
I'll call Kim and arrange a meeting.

127
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:48,599
All right. Good, Jimmy. Thank you.

128
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:51,768
I know you'll come to see
that it's for the best.

129
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:08,285
I guess I'll have to get an
office right next to yours.

130
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,998
Finally out of the mailroom, huh?

131
00:10:44,381 --> 00:10:46,091
Yes. Hello.

132
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,886
No. It's me.

133
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:28,275
- This the place where we wait?
- Think so.

134
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:01,684
So.

135
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:07,857
What'd our guy tell you about the job?

136
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:11,902
Not much.

137
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:15,656
It's a protection job. Civilian.

138
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:22,454
Guy is as green as they come, but we'll
be in there to make sure things fly right.

139
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,628
You been doing this long? I just
assume we're all heavy hitters.

140
00:12:29,837 --> 00:12:32,589
And it makes sense. The vet
recommends the best of the best.

141
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:37,135
Dealing with some of these ethnic types,
blood tends to run a little hotter.

142
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:40,930
That's just science. Physiology.

143
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:44,643
There's historical precedent.
Know what I'm saying?

144
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:49,147
So, what you packing?

145
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:53,527
- A pimento.
- Sorry, what?

146
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:55,946
Pimento sandwich.

147
00:12:57,364 --> 00:13:00,534
That's funny. Pimento.

148
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:03,954
No, I mean, what are you carrying?

149
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:06,331
You know, the piece? What's the make?

150
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,253
Pimento is a cheese. They call
it the caviar of the south.

151
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:14,130
You don't want to tell me
what you're carrying, so be it.

152
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,425
But you don't have to
be a douche about it.

153
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:19,135
Just told you what I'm carrying.

154
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:24,307
So you're saying you don't have a gun?

155
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:26,142
Is that what you're saying?

156
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:28,812
How are you here without a gun?

157
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,481
- You have a gun?
- Yeah.

158
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,693
Yeah. Of course. He's got a gun.

159
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:37,654
I got at least two guns on
me that I'll tell you about.

160
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:40,365
I go old school with
a Wilson Combat 1911.

161
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:45,120
I got a Glock 22 Gen 3. And those
are just the ones I'll tell you about.

162
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:49,959
I mean, what the hell? Really?

163
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,461
How do you not pack a gun?

164
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:13,315
Hi. Hello. My name is Price.

165
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:16,318
Actually, that's not my name.

166
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:21,114
But I have a nephew named Price.
I've always kind of liked that name.

167
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:23,283
Anyway, we're not
dealing with names today.

168
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:26,411
You can tell me or not tell me
yours. Or a fake one is fine.

169
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:31,500
If I need to talk to you, I'd prefer
something other than "Hey, you."

170
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:35,337
Either way, you all come
highly recommended so thank you.

171
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:38,590
First order of business, we
have a long drive ahead of us.

172
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,677
I have a cooler of water in
the car, some soft drinks.

173
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:45,681
I don't drink coffee, but
there is a diner on the corner.

174
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:50,686
Also a bathroom in there in
case you need to go before we go.

175
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:52,938
Second order. Money.

176
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:59,569
Just to be clear that the agreed
upon fee of $500 per man is...

177
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:00,946
agreed upon.

178
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:02,990
- If that's acceptable...
- Yeah, I have a thought.

179
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:04,950
Yeah.

180
00:15:05,158 --> 00:15:08,328
How about you give me
and Man Mountain 750 each?

181
00:15:08,537 --> 00:15:13,416
And send Uncle Fester there home.
He's not carrying a gun. He's useless.

182
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:19,089
- Is that true? You didn't bring a gun?
- I didn't think I'd need one.

183
00:15:20,507 --> 00:15:21,967
It's a protection job.

184
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:25,721
It's basic common sense that you
need a gun to protect your employer.

185
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,056
You're dead weight.

186
00:15:27,263 --> 00:15:30,100
- He's just a third wheel without a piece.
- I'll tell you what.

187
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:32,644
If I need a gun, I'll use one of his.

188
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:36,606
Really? One of my guns? How do
you picture that happening exactly?

189
00:15:36,815 --> 00:15:38,650
Well, I guess I'm gonna take it from you.

190
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:42,988
That... That is just special.

191
00:15:43,196 --> 00:15:46,157
Take. How are you gonna
take one of my guns?

192
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:49,036
Come on, Billy Jackoff.

193
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:51,705
Take my gun from me.

194
00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:53,456
Let me see it.

195
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:57,252
Here. I'll make it easy for you.

196
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:04,760
You can make it not so easy.

197
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:06,887
Sure thing.

198
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:09,973
You got it.

199
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:15,062
What the...? Son of a...

200
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:22,069
Okay. Let's see what you got.

201
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:28,117
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A guy like you...

202
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:31,787
I'll bet you'd have an
ankle holster, wouldn't you?

203
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:35,582
You know, that's cute. What else?

204
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:45,134
Wow, now, that's impressive.

205
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:48,428
So many guns, I don't
know which one to use.

206
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:52,307
How about you? You want one?

207
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:00,983
All right.

208
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:14,955
Let's go.

209
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:19,876
- But we need three guys.
- No. No, we don't. Come on. Let's go.

210
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:30,637
Oh, he'll be fine.

211
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:36,643
And now that I'm doing the job alone, I
get the full 1,500. We agree upon that?

212
00:17:36,852 --> 00:17:38,228
Sure.

213
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,073
You got this, okay? No problem.

214
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:51,658
Yes.

215
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:54,911
- Suit okay? Is it too tight or too hot?
- Yeah.

216
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,622
No, I mean. No. No. It's good.

217
00:17:57,831 --> 00:17:59,666
Well, you look good.

218
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,670
Can't even tell that's under there.

219
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:05,463
It was a good idea.

220
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:09,300
Yeah. At any point, it's too
much, you're uncomfortable...

221
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:12,846
we'll turn around and come home.
You want maybe like a safe word?

222
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:15,265
How about "get me the hell home"?

223
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:17,726
That'll work. Okay.

224
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:19,769
Let's do this.

225
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:21,813
Let's do this.

226
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:26,235
Okay.

227
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:28,820
Looking good.

228
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:32,532
We're just going for a little ride.

229
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,995
Here. Let me get that for you.

230
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:39,748
Here you go.

231
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:51,342
- Jimmy.
- Just a sec.

232
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:58,267
- Oh, crap.
- What is it?

233
00:18:58,474 --> 00:19:01,144
I must have left my stupid
phone on last night. It's dead.

234
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:03,021
Well, could you put it in the trunk?

235
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:05,190
Yeah.

236
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:21,164
Okay. Thanks.

237
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:23,833
That everyone?

238
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:25,877
They'll be here in one minute.

239
00:19:26,086 --> 00:19:29,256
Anyone still have a phone,
add it to the collection now.

240
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:32,675
- Okay. Shut it down.
- Okay. You got it.

241
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:07,961
- How you doing? You doing all right?
- Yeah.

242
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,172
Okay. Great stuff.

243
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,270
Okay. We're walking. Walking in, Chuck.

244
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:27,522
Here we go.

245
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:54,757
- Good to see you. Welcome home.
- Howard, you didn't need to do all this.

246
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:57,135
Oh, I couldn't have
stopped them if I wanted to.

247
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:59,179
- Come on, let's get you upstairs.
- Yeah. Sure.

248
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:02,098
Francis. Brenda. Jose, you shaved.

249
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:17,113
To date, we have 68 very
willing plaintiffs...

250
00:21:17,322 --> 00:21:22,827
signed to the class-action with hopes
of raising that number to 350 or more.

251
00:21:23,036 --> 00:21:26,831
Many more, now that we know Sandpiper
has facilities in five states.

252
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,586
Fraud, unfair and deceptive
trade practices, and racketeering.

253
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:34,047
Jesus. Guys, this is...

254
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:38,551
Well, no case is ever a slam dunk.

255
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,097
But I feel as confident about this as
anything that's come through our doors.

256
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:45,767
Francis, put together teams to travel
out of state. Talk to these residents.

257
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:49,187
Pair fourths with our best second years.
Laura will take care of the travel.

258
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:51,981
Kim, Daniel. Take the list
of clients Jimmy's signed.

259
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,902
Introduce yourself as the face of HHM.
Make them feel secure and confident.

260
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:58,405
Hey, Howard. I'm glad you're all excited.

261
00:21:58,613 --> 00:22:01,782
But can we slow down a second
and discuss terms, maybe?

262
00:22:01,783 --> 00:22:04,911
Oh, of course. Kind of shot
out of a cannon with this case.

263
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,247
- It's exciting stuff you have here.
- I get it.

264
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:09,291
Look, Chuck is already an equity partner.

265
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:12,043
You, as the lawyer who brought
this case to the firm...

266
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:14,712
we could guarantee
you, say, 20 percent...

267
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:18,091
of the common fund share
of the final settlement.

268
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,343
That will work.

269
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:24,847
That's a few years down the
road. As for money for you now...

270
00:22:25,056 --> 00:22:27,309
we don't do referral
fees. Chuck will agree.

271
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:30,145
- HHM doesn't view that as ethical.
- As we discussed.

272
00:22:30,353 --> 00:22:33,482
But what we could do is
arrange an of-counsel fee...

273
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:37,902
for the time you've already put in.
Time that you spent building the case.

274
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:40,029
I think we could go as high as 20,000.

275
00:22:40,863 --> 00:22:43,950
- That, too, will work.
- Great.

276
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:47,703
Give us an invoice. I'll
have Helen cut you a check.

277
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:52,708
Oh, got it right here. And I'd
like to use 312 as an office.

278
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:56,212
- It's right next to Chuck's.
- I'm sorry?

279
00:22:56,421 --> 00:23:00,716
Three-twelve. I know, it's got that view
that clients love, but you know what?

280
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:05,514
That's a waste of space. The waiting
area by the kitchen is just as good.

281
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:11,311
Well, come on, guys. I
mean, I need an office.

282
00:23:13,688 --> 00:23:17,442
Can I have the room? Everybody,
please. Just give us a few.

283
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:24,824
- Howard...
- When the room's clear, Chuck.

284
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,712
Jimmy. Jimmy, I'm just gonna say it.

285
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,007
- You're not working here.
- What are you talking about?

286
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:43,552
- You said this case is a slam dunk.
- Yes.

287
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,971
We want the case. We don't want...

288
00:23:49,265 --> 00:23:52,352
The case is all we want.

289
00:23:54,687 --> 00:23:56,565
You gotta be...

290
00:23:57,607 --> 00:23:58,900
You're serious?

291
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:03,446
I walk in here with a multi-million
dollar class action lawsuit...

292
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:07,450
on a damn platinum platter.

293
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:12,038
A case that I found, that I made happen.

294
00:24:12,247 --> 00:24:15,625
And you don't want me? Why in Christ not?

295
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:19,712
Well, I know that you hate me, Howard.

296
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:22,840
You better believe,
feeling goes both ways.

297
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:26,677
But I'm willing to set that
aside to work with you on this.

298
00:24:26,886 --> 00:24:28,763
Why can't you do the same for me?

299
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:31,682
What is it that you can't let go of?

300
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:37,980
What slight did I make to your fine,
upstanding character you can't forgive?

301
00:24:38,189 --> 00:24:41,401
A majority decision has been
made by myself and the partners.

302
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,696
All due respect to you, Chuck, we are not
taking any new associates into the firm.

303
00:24:45,905 --> 00:24:47,907
Bullshit. New associates?

304
00:24:48,116 --> 00:24:52,495
Someone walks in with a case like
this, you beg them to be partner.

305
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:54,497
Tell me why.

306
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:58,251
You didn't want me then.
Okay. You don't want me now?

307
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,128
Explain it.

308
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:03,005
Howard.

309
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:06,968
I don't know what to say.

310
00:25:07,552 --> 00:25:11,473
I am very disappointed. I really
think you should reconsider.

311
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:16,185
I'm sorry, but no. I think it's best
if Jimmy takes the of-counsel fee.

312
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:18,396
We could probably up
it a bit. Keep in mind.

313
00:25:18,605 --> 00:25:21,524
You will be well compensated in the
back end. It's easy money, Jimmy.

314
00:25:21,732 --> 00:25:23,234
No reason not to take it.

315
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,946
Go to hell, Howard.

316
00:25:27,155 --> 00:25:29,157
I'm not giving you my case.

317
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:31,993
And I'm gonna tell every
one of those clients...

318
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:35,664
what a lying miserable
pig fucker you are.

319
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:41,919
I will burn the whole thing to
the ground before I give it to you.

320
00:25:44,172 --> 00:25:47,925
Okay then. If that's your decision.

321
00:25:49,302 --> 00:25:51,596
Good luck to you moving forward.

322
00:26:01,397 --> 00:26:03,608
What the hell just happened?

323
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:09,947
Yeah. Come.

324
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,075
Hi.

325
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:16,537
Was wondering if you had a moment?

326
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:19,915
Sure. Just give me a second.

327
00:26:33,054 --> 00:26:36,891
- What's up?
- I wanted to talk about what happened.

328
00:26:37,391 --> 00:26:39,894
With Sandpiper Crossing,
things didn't work out.

329
00:26:40,102 --> 00:26:43,105
It was unfortunate. It was a good case.

330
00:26:43,438 --> 00:26:46,441
- But things happen.
- I'm just trying to understand why.

331
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,070
Jimmy found that case. He built it.

332
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:51,780
Did all of the leg work.

333
00:26:51,989 --> 00:26:55,784
The class action doesn't exist without
him. He deserves a seat at the table.

334
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:57,619
I understand.

335
00:26:57,828 --> 00:27:02,166
But the decision has been made, Kim.

336
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,752
Thank you for your input.

337
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:12,634
But why?

338
00:27:16,013 --> 00:27:21,602
The partners have made a decision
and the why is not your concern.

339
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,063
I think it is my concern.

340
00:27:24,272 --> 00:27:26,190
And why is that?

341
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:30,360
Because he's my friend.

342
00:27:31,153 --> 00:27:33,864
And the way I see it, you're
not treating him fairly.

343
00:27:34,364 --> 00:27:36,284
The way you see it?

344
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:41,580
I don't know what image you
have of him, past or present.

345
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:47,086
Or whatever he did or said to
you, but Jimmy is a good lawyer.

346
00:27:47,295 --> 00:27:48,921
And he works very hard.

347
00:27:49,338 --> 00:27:52,300
Did your friend send
you in here to say that?

348
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:55,177
No.

349
00:27:55,677 --> 00:27:58,097
I'm saying it because I believe it.

350
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:01,516
Well.

351
00:28:01,725 --> 00:28:02,977
Duly noted.

352
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:05,604
Want to know what I believe?

353
00:28:05,813 --> 00:28:09,900
I believe that you're way out
of your depth in this matter.

354
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:14,446
So the next time that you want to come in
here and tell me what I'm doing wrong...

355
00:28:14,655 --> 00:28:17,449
you are welcome to keep it to yourself.

356
00:28:17,658 --> 00:28:19,785
Because I don't care.

357
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:32,840
Stop.

358
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:38,887
Close the door.

359
00:28:49,648 --> 00:28:51,317
They're late.

360
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,694
Must be traffic.

361
00:28:57,489 --> 00:28:59,658
I wonder how this is supposed to work.

362
00:29:00,701 --> 00:29:05,122
I mean, who goes first? Do
I hand over the pills first?

363
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:09,501
Or do they give me the money
and then I hand over the pills?

364
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,754
I mean, I guess it makes
sense if we just exchanged...

365
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:16,508
at the same time, right?
I mean, that's fair.

366
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:19,887
Maybe we just count to three.

367
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:22,806
Probably the less talk, the better.

368
00:29:23,015 --> 00:29:24,058
Right.

369
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:28,854
Yeah. I suppose you could really
overthink something like this.

370
00:29:29,063 --> 00:29:30,231
Yeah.

371
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:33,567
- Well, in any case...
- Here is what is going to happen.

372
00:29:33,775 --> 00:29:36,570
You're gonna take the money.
You're going to count it.

373
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:39,865
If it's all there, you
hand them the pills.

374
00:29:40,074 --> 00:29:42,076
Easy peasy.

375
00:29:56,424 --> 00:30:00,469
I knew we needed three guys. I
knew it. It's a three man job.

376
00:30:01,178 --> 00:30:02,596
God.

377
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,574
Hello. Hi.

378
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,621
- Do you have it?
- I do.

379
00:30:29,998 --> 00:30:31,875
Do you have the money?

380
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:05,909
Is it all there?

381
00:31:09,663 --> 00:31:13,501
We're short 20. Twenty dollars.

382
00:31:14,168 --> 00:31:15,919
That's fine.

383
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:20,799
Agreed amount or no deal.

384
00:31:22,092 --> 00:31:23,302
You serious?

385
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,388
You saying I intentionally shorted you?

386
00:31:26,596 --> 00:31:29,933
No. Mistakes happen.

387
00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:33,187
You really willing to blow
up this deal over 20 bucks?

388
00:31:34,438 --> 00:31:36,231
Are you?

389
00:32:02,132 --> 00:32:06,094
It's all there. Eighty milligram
pills, still factory sealed.

390
00:32:49,471 --> 00:32:51,306
You can pay me now.

391
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:06,988
How did you know?

392
00:33:08,449 --> 00:33:11,368
How did you know not to bring a gun?

393
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:15,623
This 1,500? I'll just say
you're getting a bargain.

394
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,667
I put in a lot of leg
work before coming here.

395
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:22,671
Now, that fella you just met
with, name is Ignacio Varga.

396
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:25,507
He runs with a connected
crew of drug dealers.

397
00:33:25,715 --> 00:33:28,427
This deal he's doing with you,
he's doing outside his crew.

398
00:33:28,636 --> 00:33:30,262
He doesn't want his bosses to know.

399
00:33:30,471 --> 00:33:34,516
So it was in his best interest
that things go very smoothly.

400
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,897
The lesson is, if you're gonna
be a criminal, do your homework.

401
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:43,275
Wait. I'm not a bad guy.

402
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:46,320
I didn't say you were a bad
guy. I said you're a criminal.

403
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:49,490
What's the difference?

404
00:33:49,698 --> 00:33:53,951
I've known good criminals and bad
cops. Bad priests. Honorable thieves.

405
00:33:53,952 --> 00:33:57,665
You can be on one side
of the law or the other.

406
00:33:57,872 --> 00:34:02,002
But if you make a deal with
somebody, you keep your word.

407
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,923
You can go home today with your
money and never do this again.

408
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:09,759
But you took something that wasn't yours.

409
00:34:09,968 --> 00:34:12,220
And you sold it for a profit.

410
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:17,351
You're now a criminal. Good
one, bad one? That's up to you.

411
00:34:19,687 --> 00:34:21,855
I can get more pills.

412
00:34:22,272 --> 00:34:25,900
And I am sure that
fella will keep buying.

413
00:34:28,987 --> 00:34:33,158
Why don't you get us home? You
can sleep on it before you decide.

414
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:20,313
- Hey.
- Hey.

415
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:22,106
I was worried about you.

416
00:35:22,315 --> 00:35:26,277
- I must have called a dozen times.
- Sorry. My phone died.

417
00:35:26,486 --> 00:35:29,489
It's one of the perks of living
in Chuckland. Nowhere to plug in.

418
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:33,033
But tonight, it's Jimmyland.

419
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:36,954
I've got gin. I've got tequila.
I've got good Kentucky bourbon.

420
00:35:37,163 --> 00:35:40,958
And you may partake with me in any
beverage of your choice on one condition.

421
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:45,463
You have to listen to me rant about
what an unwashed asshole your boss is.

422
00:35:45,672 --> 00:35:48,007
- Jimmy...
- No. It's true.

423
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:49,466
Don't deny it.

424
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:53,762
He has reached a level of douche baggery
that will live on for generations.

425
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:57,224
Passed down by windtalkers and the like.

426
00:35:57,433 --> 00:36:00,645
He'd rather tank a multi-million
dollar case than work with me.

427
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:03,897
That's sick. He has a sickness.

428
00:36:04,106 --> 00:36:07,360
He hates me that much? I hate him more.

429
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:09,487
- What you drinking?
- Jimmy.

430
00:36:09,696 --> 00:36:14,074
Yeah, I wanna grab him by that stupid
knit tie of his and swing him around.

431
00:36:14,283 --> 00:36:15,784
- Jimmy.
- Hamlindigo blue.

432
00:36:15,993 --> 00:36:19,038
- How about hamlindigo blow me?
- Jimmy!

433
00:36:19,622 --> 00:36:21,457
I think you should take the deal.

434
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:25,044
What?

435
00:36:25,252 --> 00:36:29,006
I think you should slow
down and think about it.

436
00:36:29,674 --> 00:36:34,637
Because taking the deal really
is the best thing for you.

437
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:39,225
You'll find yourself a
proper office, your office.

438
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:44,313
You'll build your practice.
You'll leave Hamlin and HHM behind.

439
00:36:44,522 --> 00:36:46,607
Be your own man.

440
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:51,487
You want me to give up the case?

441
00:36:51,696 --> 00:36:52,739
My case?

442
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:56,283
I want you to be happy.

443
00:36:56,492 --> 00:36:59,495
And I know you want
to stay with the case.

444
00:36:59,704 --> 00:37:03,541
But you'll get all the financial
reward without the risk.

445
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,958
How can that be bad?

446
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:10,256
You come here peddling that
horseshit on me? God, you?

447
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:12,299
You sure know where
your bread is buttered.

448
00:37:12,508 --> 00:37:15,344
Don't wanna go up against the
boss, that it? You're like a...

449
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:18,305
You're like a damn pod person.

450
00:37:19,557 --> 00:37:21,308
What did Hamlin promise you? Please...

451
00:37:21,517 --> 00:37:23,644
tell me he didn't buy you off cheap.

452
00:37:23,852 --> 00:37:25,938
Did he promise you
the office I asked for?

453
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:29,024
Or did he just swear never
to move you back downstairs?

454
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:33,446
Take the deal.

455
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,982
Oh, son of a bitch.

456
00:39:13,462 --> 00:39:15,255
Jimmy.

457
00:39:15,464 --> 00:39:17,800
- Hey.
- Jesus, when did you come in?

458
00:39:18,008 --> 00:39:22,179
I don't know. I left my watch outside.

459
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:26,183
Maybe an hour ago.
You doing some ironing?

460
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:27,601
Yeah.

461
00:39:29,854 --> 00:39:34,149
Hey, I know things didn't
go well for us yesterday.

462
00:39:34,358 --> 00:39:38,111
But being back in the office
sure felt good, really good.

463
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,615
I'm gonna be prepared in case
any more work comes my way.

464
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:46,245
And the space blanket lining in
the suit, what a fantastic idea.

465
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:50,332
It really made being
outside much more tolerable.

466
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:54,545
I'm thinking about taking a little
walk around the block later on.

467
00:39:54,754 --> 00:39:57,673
That's great, Chuck. You should do that.

468
00:40:00,384 --> 00:40:02,469
Jimmy, are you all right?

469
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:06,682
Well, I didn't sleep last night, so...

470
00:40:07,558 --> 00:40:12,646
I was doing some soul searching,
and I came to a decision.

471
00:40:13,981 --> 00:40:15,482
I'm gonna take that deal.

472
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,862
You're sure? This is what you want?

473
00:40:22,072 --> 00:40:24,116
Kim talked to me.

474
00:40:24,324 --> 00:40:27,327
I got pretty nasty. I'm not proud.

475
00:40:27,536 --> 00:40:32,875
But thinking about what she said,
I'd be a fool to pass up that money.

476
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:35,168
It is a lot of money.

477
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:39,673
And I have zero interest
in working with Howard.

478
00:40:39,882 --> 00:40:44,177
So it's probably best that we
keep to our separate sandboxes.

479
00:40:44,386 --> 00:40:49,475
- Wish it could have worked out.
- Yeah. Imagine that, huh?

480
00:40:49,683 --> 00:40:53,437
The two McGill boys side
by side storming the gates.

481
00:40:53,646 --> 00:40:56,064
Righting wrongs, taking
down the bad guys.

482
00:40:56,273 --> 00:40:58,066
And making a boatload of money to boot.

483
00:40:58,275 --> 00:40:59,777
That would have been great.

484
00:40:59,986 --> 00:41:02,822
- Right?
- The very best.

485
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,324
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

486
00:41:07,326 --> 00:41:09,495
I'll keep on Howard.

487
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:15,208
Won't badger him, but maybe
I can gradually wear him down.

488
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:17,461
- Get him to come around.
- That's...

489
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,463
Thanks.

490
00:41:20,464 --> 00:41:23,009
I'm so lucky to have
you looking out for me.

491
00:41:23,216 --> 00:41:25,594
I'll do what I can. I'm
not promising anything.

492
00:41:25,803 --> 00:41:28,055
I get it. It's a long shot.

493
00:41:28,263 --> 00:41:31,725
- Hey, he might change his mind.
- Yeah.

494
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:38,273
Hey, maybe there is a way that you
could get Howard to change his mind.

495
00:41:38,482 --> 00:41:40,734
- How?
- Quit.

496
00:41:42,862 --> 00:41:46,073
- Jimmy, no. No, no, no.
- No, no, it's perfect.

497
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:49,952
We've already been through all this.
The reasons I'm never gonna leave HHM.

498
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,412
But you don't have to really quit.

499
00:41:52,621 --> 00:41:55,123
Okay? You just threaten to quit, right?

500
00:41:55,332 --> 00:41:58,502
You get in a game of chicken with Howard.

501
00:41:58,711 --> 00:42:03,131
He's gotta blink, or HHM goes
under. It's a perfect plan.

502
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,636
- Jimmy...
- If you want us working together.

503
00:42:07,845 --> 00:42:10,222
You can make it happen easily.

504
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,392
I mean, hey, that reception
you got yesterday at HHM...

505
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,396
how about that, right? The whole
lobby of HHM applauding for you.

506
00:42:18,397 --> 00:42:20,273
They love you.

507
00:42:20,482 --> 00:42:25,153
Now, you threaten to pull out, Hamlin
would be insane to screw with you.

508
00:42:25,362 --> 00:42:28,908
You've got the nuclear option.
Launch the doomsday device.

509
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:35,539
Game over. If working with me is
what you really want, right, Chuck?

510
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:40,293
You called him.

511
00:42:40,502 --> 00:42:41,670
You called Hamlin.

512
00:42:43,463 --> 00:42:47,175
I always turn my phone off
before I put it in your mailbox.

513
00:42:47,384 --> 00:42:51,638
Two nights ago, it was
left on. Battery drained.

514
00:42:51,847 --> 00:42:55,350
I was so damn sure that
I turned it off, you know.

515
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:57,770
Because I always do. It's a habit, right?

516
00:42:57,978 --> 00:43:00,313
So it was nagging me. It was nagging me.

517
00:43:00,522 --> 00:43:03,483
So I called the phone
company. Turns out...

518
00:43:03,692 --> 00:43:08,530
there was a deleted call at 2
a.m. when I was asleep right there.

519
00:43:10,365 --> 00:43:13,410
And you know whose number? Hamlin's.

520
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:21,501
The only person who could have made
that call and deleted it is you, Chuck.

521
00:43:23,462 --> 00:43:25,589
Boy, that phone, huh?

522
00:43:25,798 --> 00:43:28,759
Phone must have felt like
a blowtorch in your ear.

523
00:43:28,968 --> 00:43:30,384
All that electricity.

524
00:43:30,385 --> 00:43:35,766
All those radio waves right up
against the side of your head. My God.

525
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:40,395
What was so important that you had
to call Howard before our meeting?

526
00:43:40,604 --> 00:43:41,897
The only thing I can think...

527
00:43:42,106 --> 00:43:47,611
The only thing that makes sense
is... you told him not to hire me.

528
00:43:48,236 --> 00:43:50,614
It was always you, right?

529
00:43:51,115 --> 00:43:54,076
Right back to when I passed the
bar and tried to join the firm.

530
00:43:54,284 --> 00:43:57,163
You didn't want me.

531
00:43:58,122 --> 00:43:59,539
Speak up.

532
00:43:59,748 --> 00:44:02,126
Tell me why.

533
00:44:02,876 --> 00:44:06,213
It's the least you can do
for me now. I'm your brother.

534
00:44:06,421 --> 00:44:08,924
We're supposed to look
out for each other.

535
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:12,552
Why were you working against me, Chuck?

536
00:44:14,554 --> 00:44:16,723
You're not a real lawyer.

537
00:44:17,975 --> 00:44:20,769
- I'm what?
- You're not a real lawyer.

538
00:44:22,312 --> 00:44:28,318
University of American Samoa, for Christ's
sake. An online course? What a joke.

539
00:44:28,527 --> 00:44:30,737
I worked my ass off to get where I am.

540
00:44:30,946 --> 00:44:34,200
And you take these shortcuts and
you think suddenly you're my peer?

541
00:44:34,407 --> 00:44:37,077
You do what I do because you're
funny and you can make people laugh?

542
00:44:37,285 --> 00:44:40,039
I committed my life to this.

543
00:44:40,789 --> 00:44:46,086
You don't slide into it like a cheap
pair of slippers and reap all the rewards.

544
00:44:46,294 --> 00:44:49,589
- I thought you were proud of me.
- I was!

545
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:53,301
When you straightened out and got a
job in the mailroom, I was very proud.

546
00:44:53,886 --> 00:44:55,387
So that's it then, right?

547
00:44:55,595 --> 00:44:59,766
Keep old Jimmy down in the mailroom.
He's not good enough to be a lawyer.

548
00:44:59,975 --> 00:45:02,144
I know you.

549
00:45:02,352 --> 00:45:05,313
I know what you were, what
you are. People don't change.

550
00:45:05,522 --> 00:45:07,107
You're Slippin' Jimmy.

551
00:45:07,315 --> 00:45:09,235
And Slippin' Jimmy I
can handle just fine.

552
00:45:09,442 --> 00:45:13,238
Slippin' Jimmy with a law degree
is like a chimp with a machine gun.

553
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:15,365
The law is sacred.

554
00:45:15,574 --> 00:45:17,910
If you abuse that power, people get hurt.

555
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:19,452
This is not a game.

556
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:24,499
You have to know... On some
level, I know you know I'm right.

557
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:26,126
You know I'm right.

558
00:45:34,426 --> 00:45:36,386
I...

559
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:40,224
I got you a 20 pound bag of ice.

560
00:45:40,432 --> 00:45:45,979
And some bacon, and some eggs, and a
couple of those steaks that you like.

561
00:45:46,188 --> 00:45:49,024
Some fuel canisters. It's
enough for three or four days.

562
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:53,570
After that, you're on your own.

563
00:45:54,696 --> 00:45:56,531
I am done.

564
00:45:57,991 --> 00:45:59,618
Jimmy.

565
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,204
Jimmy.

566
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,465
Jimmy...

567
00:46:14,883 --> 00:46:17,136
Jimmy, come back inside.

568
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,309
Jimmy!

569
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:25,727
Jimmy.

570
