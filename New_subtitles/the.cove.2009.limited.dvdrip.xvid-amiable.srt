1
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,700
I do want to say that we
try to do the story legally.

2
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:25,033
Shit.

3
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:29,507
I thought of all the possibilities
of what could happen,

4
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:31,944
and it kept me up at night.

5
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:42,285
The story that Ric
showed me at the beginning

6
00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:44,587
was just the tip of the iceberg.

7
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:03,999
Here it is... the town of Taiji.

8
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:08,040
The little town
with a really big secret.

9
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:12,772
It's funny driving into Taiji.

10
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:15,043
It's kind of like <i>The Twilight Zone</i>.

11
00:03:15,117 --> 00:03:16,880
It's so bizarre

12
00:03:16,952 --> 00:03:19,182
because if you didn't know
what's going on over here,

13
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:22,917
you would think this is a town
that loved dolphins and whales.

14
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:28,224
On our left here is the infamous
Taiji Whale Museum.

15
00:03:28,296 --> 00:03:30,821
And I really, really
hate this place.

16
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:34,165
When we first got to Japan,

17
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:36,261
Ric O'Barry was incredibly frustrated.

18
00:03:36,338 --> 00:03:38,135
He said, "Oh, you have
to wear a mask.

19
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:39,696
Otherwise, they'll know
that we're here."

20
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:41,675
And I thought, okay, all right.

21
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,210
There's the police.

22
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:45,872
I've got to hunch over
and change my shape

23
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:48,415
so they think
I'm just some old Japanese guy.

24
00:03:50,252 --> 00:03:51,879
I thought, you know, what am I doing?

25
00:03:51,953 --> 00:03:54,547
I went halfway across the world
to end up in this car,

26
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:56,352
locked up with this paranoid guy.

27
00:03:56,424 --> 00:03:57,516
Somebody's behind me.

28
00:03:57,592 --> 00:03:59,822
I don't know who that is.

29
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:01,658
Yep. He's coming. He's coming.

30
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,754
Is he really?

31
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,163
Yeah. I've been doing this too long.

32
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:08,327
The mayor of this town
actually gave me the key to the city.

33
00:04:08,403 --> 00:04:09,927
I was welcome then.

34
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:12,303
Today they'd kill me if they could.

35
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:13,898
And I'm not exaggerating.

36
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:16,443
If these fishermen could
catch me and kill me,

37
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:18,035
they would.

38
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:21,008
About three years ago,

39
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:23,346
my friend Jim Clark and I
started this organization...

40
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:26,717
The Oceanic Preservation Society, OPS.

41
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:29,723
We've been diving for over 35 years,

42
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,817
and you could go back to the same
dive spot year after year

43
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:34,486
and literally see
the degradation of the oceans

44
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:36,292
before your very eyes.

45
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:39,458
There's major extinctions
going on right now in our lifetime.

46
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:42,230
Jim had the idea

47
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:44,932
to try to do something
about it, to stop this,

48
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:47,736
so I began documenting
reefs around the world.

49
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:51,074
I went to a marine mammal conference
down in San Diego.

50
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:54,946
There was 2,000 of the world's
top marine mammal scientists,

51
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:58,452
and Ric O'Barry was supposed
to be the keynote speaker,

52
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,851
and at the last minute,

53
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:03,049
the sponsor of the program
pulled him from the ticket.

54
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:04,591
I thought, oh God, that's interesting.

55
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:05,853
Well, who's the sponsor?

56
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:08,020
They said, "Sea World."

57
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:24,778
A lot of marine mammal
scientists get their money

58
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,440
from Hub Research Institute,

59
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:30,848
which is the nonprofit arm of Sea World.

60
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,615
They don't like me.

61
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:37,658
They don't like my message
about captivity,

62
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:39,318
and they took me off the list.

63
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:43,455
They wouldn't let me
talk about this dolphin slaughter in Taiji.

64
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:45,829
I said, "Dolphin slaughter?
What's... What's that about?"

65
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:48,392
He says, "Well, I'm going next week.

66
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,596
You want to come?"

67
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:57,141
Now we're approaching the area
that's most important.

68
00:05:59,014 --> 00:06:01,346
That's a dolphin's
worst nightmare right there.

69
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:06,147
Hundreds of thousands
of dolphins have died there.

70
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:10,089
You'll see the signs...
"Keep Out," "Danger."

71
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:13,821
There are fishermen walking
around these hills with knives.

72
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:16,295
This is a national park.

73
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:17,763
The fishermen told me.

74
00:06:17,832 --> 00:06:21,461
They said, "If the world finds out
what goes on here,

75
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:23,470
we'll be shut down."

76
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:24,971
Can you imagine that?

77
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,803
They actually told us that.

78
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:30,367
We knew to get in there
and film exactly what happens.

79
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:32,208
We need to know the truth.

80
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:37,148
When we got back to the hotel...

81
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:39,015
It's a big spa hotel,

82
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:41,317
people going by in robes,

83
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:45,325
and there's these three
undercover cops talking to Ric.

84
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:54,792
No.

85
00:06:58,306 --> 00:06:59,364
No.

86
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:01,431
- No.
- No?

87
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:03,170
No.

88
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:04,370
In the background,

89
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:07,677
you could see these dolphin boats
going by in the window,

90
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:09,580
and it was just... it was so surreal.

91
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:11,585
I couldn't... I wanted to laugh,

92
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:13,518
and I wanted to scream
at the same time.

93
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:21,421
No. No.

94
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:23,586
Right. I know.

95
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,155
Yeah.

96
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:27,929
I don't enter. No, no.

97
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:30,471
Thank you so much, and...

98
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:31,527
You're welcome.

99
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:33,471
- See you again.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

100
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,772
I never planned
on being an activist.

101
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:38,574
One thing leads to another,

102
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:41,740
and now if there's
a dolphin in trouble

103
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:43,579
anywhere in the world,

104
00:07:43,651 --> 00:07:44,879
my phone will ring.

105
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:51,456
Ric is world famous
for his work with dolphins.

106
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:55,257
The first time I connected
with him in recent years

107
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,423
was on a trip down to Nicaragua.

108
00:07:58,533 --> 00:07:59,830
There were two dolphins

109
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:02,199
in a swimming pool filled
with their own excrement.

110
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,707
Ric somehow enlisted
the military forces of Nicaragua.

111
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:09,335
The dolphins were
put on a helicopter,

112
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:11,038
and then out to sea we go,

113
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:12,670
and the dolphins are released.

114
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:17,412
We're going to capture these dolphins
out of the wild

115
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:18,850
and bring them into captivity.

116
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,980
There are people
who will set them free.

117
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:25,519
In March of this year,

118
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:28,221
O'Barry was arrested
three times in Florida

119
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:31,026
for trying to free some captive dolphins.

120
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:33,727
On Earth Day, he was
arrested for the same thing

121
00:08:33,802 --> 00:08:35,929
on the Island of Bimini.

122
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:37,767
How many times
have you been arrested?

123
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,103
This year?

124
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:45,039
Swimmer, you're within
a government-authorized test area.

125
00:08:45,113 --> 00:08:47,172
You are holding up
a government project.

126
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:49,113
Do you understand?

127
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:50,845
God damn it.

128
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:56,817
A dolphin in the right spot
can make a million dollars a year.

129
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:58,950
There's a lot of money in it.

130
00:08:59,027 --> 00:09:00,289
If you get in their way...

131
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:01,658
and I get in their way...

132
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:04,095
it can be very, very dangerous.

133
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,597
Jane Tipson, she was murdered.

134
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:11,070
She's the second colleague
I've worked with that was murdered.

135
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:12,663
The other one was Jenny May.

136
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,972
We were trying to stop
the traffic in Russian dolphins,

137
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:18,774
and it involved a hunger strike.

138
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,247
About the tenth day, I passed out,

139
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:22,874
and I went to a hospital there,

140
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:24,248
so Jenny became a target,

141
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:26,082
and they followed her
down the beach

142
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:28,315
and strangled her with her own belt.

143
00:09:30,158 --> 00:09:33,525
These dolphins are symbolic
of a new day for the environment.

144
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:36,564
It's all about respect now,
not exploitation.

145
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:41,834
I feel somewhat responsible

146
00:09:41,903 --> 00:09:44,337
because it was the <i>Flipper</i> TV series

147
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:48,034
that created this
multi-billion-dollar industry.

148
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:52,478
It created this desire
to swim with them and kiss them

149
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:55,175
and hold them and hug them
and love them to death,

150
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,377
and it created all these captures.

151
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,864
There were five female dolphins

152
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:15,164
who collectively played
the part of Flipper.

153
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:17,534
I captured the five dolphins myself.

154
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,898
The entire crew turns to
with battle station teamwork.

155
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:24,535
When the porpoise is sighted,

156
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,671
not a moment can be lost.

157
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:29,148
The men handle this creature
with infinite care.

158
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:33,153
She seems to sense
that she has come home,

159
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:35,917
that no harm will come to her now.

160
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,049
She is safe.

161
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:50,093
When I started training dolphins,
there was no manual.

162
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,433
I would get the script,

163
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:55,033
and it says "Flipper goes over
to the dock "and picks up the gun

164
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:57,202
and then swims down left to right."

165
00:10:57,278 --> 00:10:59,872
I had to actually translate that
into action somehow.

166
00:10:59,948 --> 00:11:01,176
Thanks, Flipper.

167
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:04,518
Yeah. Thanks, Flipper.

168
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:08,547
The thing that really struck me

169
00:11:08,623 --> 00:11:11,251
was that they're smarter
than we think they are.

170
00:11:13,595 --> 00:11:15,927
The house that you see
on the <i>Flipper</i> set

171
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:17,123
where the family lives

172
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:18,426
was actually my house.

173
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:21,627
I lived there all year round
for seven years.

174
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:23,227
And right in front of the house

175
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:25,431
there was a lake, salt water lake,

176
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:28,532
and that's where Flipper was
at the end of the dock.

177
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,444
When <i>Flipper</i> came on television
at Friday night at 7:30,

178
00:11:32,513 --> 00:11:34,606
I would take my television
set from the house

179
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:36,013
and go down the end of the dock

180
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:37,574
with a long extension cord,

181
00:11:37,652 --> 00:11:41,110
and Cathy would watch
herself on television,

182
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:44,784
and she could tell the difference
between herself and Suzy,

183
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:47,293
who was another Flipper
dolphin that was used.

184
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,893
I knew then they were self-aware,

185
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:56,266
and when you become conscious
of this nonhuman intelligence,

186
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:59,568
you realize after a while
they don't really belong in captivity.

187
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:02,633
But I didn't do anything about it.

188
00:12:04,178 --> 00:12:07,045
One day, it all ended.

189
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:10,778
Like the props, they went
back to the Miami Seaquarium.

190
00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:21,920
When you just walk into this place
and the music is playing,

191
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:24,362
the dolphin is jumping and smiling,

192
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:27,026
it's hard to see the problem.

193
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:32,129
But a dolphin's smile
is nature's greatest deception.

194
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:36,165
It creates the illusion
they're always happy.

195
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:54,191
The nerve center of any dolphinarium
is the fish house.

196
00:12:54,262 --> 00:12:56,856
And if you go to any one
of these fish houses,

197
00:12:56,931 --> 00:13:00,367
you'll see bottles
of Maalox and Tagamet.

198
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:03,336
And they're used
because dolphins get ulcers,

199
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:05,497
because they're all stressed out.

200
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,570
You have to see them in the wild

201
00:13:09,644 --> 00:13:12,374
to understand
why captivity doesn't work.

202
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:31,731
In the wild, they're traveling
40 miles a day.

203
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,132
They could be surfing
in one area in the morning,

204
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:38,604
and the next hour
they could be 25 miles away

205
00:13:38,673 --> 00:13:41,540
feeding or socializing.

206
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:46,841
Dolphins are acoustic creatures.

207
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:48,745
That's their primary sense.

208
00:13:51,018 --> 00:13:53,680
The best sonar that man has

209
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:56,349
is a toy compared
to the dolphins' sonar.

210
00:13:56,424 --> 00:13:57,652
When you're in the water,

211
00:13:57,725 --> 00:13:59,420
the dolphins can see
right through you.

212
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:01,962
They can see your heart beating.

213
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:03,428
They can see your bones.

214
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:04,829
They can see if you're pregnant.

215
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:10,796
They get a lot of information
with their sound.

216
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,206
The dolphin is captured
and put in a concrete tank

217
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:18,507
surrounded by a stadium
full of screaming people.

218
00:14:21,816 --> 00:14:24,683
At the National Aquarium in Baltimore,

219
00:14:24,752 --> 00:14:27,482
when it first opened,
dolphins were dying left and right.

220
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:28,852
They couldn't keep dolphins alive,

221
00:14:28,923 --> 00:14:30,288
and they finally figured out

222
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:35,295
it's because the filtration system
was making a lot of noise.

223
00:14:36,697 --> 00:14:39,257
It's the stress that kills them.

224
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:43,100
So they're very sensitive to sound.

225
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:45,162
That's their primary sense,

226
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:48,902
and that's their downfall in Taiji.

227
00:14:55,082 --> 00:14:57,175
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

228
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:58,479
There's 12 of them.

229
00:14:58,553 --> 00:15:00,680
This is a classic drive,

230
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:02,347
what you're watching here.

231
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:04,991
There are migratory routes

232
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:07,892
that dolphins have been using
for thousands of years,

233
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:10,760
and they just wait
till the dolphins come by.

234
00:15:10,832 --> 00:15:13,699
The boats then put these
long poles in the water

235
00:15:13,768 --> 00:15:16,828
which have a flange on the bottom,

236
00:15:16,904 --> 00:15:20,431
and they just bang on these poles
with hammers,

237
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:25,810
and they create a wall of sound
which frightens the dolphins.

238
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:31,280
There were several hundred dolphins
being driven ashore.

239
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:33,820
I'd never seen so many
dolphins before,

240
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:36,516
and they were all
running for their lives,

241
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:38,388
running from this wall of sound.

242
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:43,964
I think I can actually
hear the banging,

243
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:45,498
but I hear it all the time.

244
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:47,124
I hear it in my sleep.

245
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:50,034
That sound never goes away
once you hear it.

246
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:53,268
By the time they get to the lagoon,

247
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:56,674
they're totally freaked out,
stressed out to the max.

248
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:59,110
They seal it, then they go home.

249
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:01,809
The next morning,

250
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:04,545
all of these dolphin trainers
will be lined up

251
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:09,249
selecting the ones that they want
for the dolphinariums.

252
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:27,100
They're looking for bottlenose
dolphin, primarily.

253
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:28,698
They're looking for Flipper,

254
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:31,472
and so they collect young females,

255
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,741
just like we did for the <i>Flipper</i> show.

256
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:39,016
And they're flown to different
parts of the world.

257
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:04,267
I could have my own dolphin facility
somewhere in the Caribbean

258
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:05,903
and be making 2 or 3
million dollars a year

259
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,642
like these guys, if I wanted to.

260
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,843
But I walked away from that.

261
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:14,785
The thing that turned me around

262
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:17,949
was the death of Flipper, of Cathy.

263
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,993
She was really depressed.
I could feel it.

264
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:25,157
I could see it.

265
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:28,565
And she committed suicide in my arms.

266
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:32,037
That's a very strong word, suicide.

267
00:17:32,106 --> 00:17:33,573
But you have to understand

268
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:38,203
dolphins and other whales
are not automatic air breathers,

269
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,678
like we are.

270
00:17:39,747 --> 00:17:43,308
Every breath they take
is a conscious effort.

271
00:17:43,384 --> 00:17:45,614
And so they can end their life

272
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:49,019
whenever life becomes too unbearable

273
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,524
by not taking the next breath.

274
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:54,584
And it's in that context
I use the word suicide.

275
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:56,186
She did that.

276
00:17:56,263 --> 00:17:58,026
She swam into my arms

277
00:17:58,099 --> 00:17:59,566
and looked me right in the eye

278
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:01,659
and... took a breath...

279
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:04,063
and didn't take another one.

280
00:18:05,272 --> 00:18:06,671
I just let her go,

281
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:11,144
and she sank straight down on her belly
to the bottom of the tank.

282
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:17,215
The next day, I was in the Bimini jail

283
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:21,243
for trying to free a dolphin
at the Lerner Marine Laboratory.

284
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:24,223
That's how I reacted to it.

285
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,852
I was going to free
every captive dolphin I could.

286
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:32,295
I spent ten years
building that industry up.

287
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:38,236
And I spent the last 35 years
trying to tear it down.

288
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:44,273
When I started out,
there were only three dolphinariums.

289
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:50,074
Today it's become
a multi-billion-dollar industry.

290
00:18:51,886 --> 00:18:54,514
In all of these captures,

291
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:59,548
we helped create the largest slaughter
of dolphins on the planet.

292
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:07,891
Anyone can watch the capture process
go on from the road.

293
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:09,401
But Ric pointed out

294
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,495
where they take the boats
around to the secret cove

295
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:16,134
that nobody could see
where dolphins that weren't selected

296
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,976
are slaughtered and sold for their meat.

297
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:34,024
Here in Taiji,

298
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:37,758
you can go to the Whale Museum
and watch the dolphin show

299
00:19:37,832 --> 00:19:39,891
and eat a dolphin at the same time.

300
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:43,994
They sell dolphin and whale meat
right in the dolphinarium.

301
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,538
It's the captivity industry
that keeps this slaughter going

302
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:58,483
by rewarding the fishermen
for their bad behavior.

303
00:19:58,552 --> 00:20:01,715
They only get $600 for a dead dolphin,

304
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:07,091
but they can get more than $150,000
for a live show dolphin.

305
00:20:09,396 --> 00:20:12,832
I told Ric
that I'd help him out,

306
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,266
that we'll fix this, we'll change this.

307
00:20:16,837 --> 00:20:18,395
And I didn't tell him how

308
00:20:18,472 --> 00:20:21,600
because I really didn't know
how we were going to do it.

309
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:25,304
There are lots of groups
here in Japan...

310
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:27,813
World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace,

311
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:30,214
International Fund
for Animal Welfare.

312
00:20:30,284 --> 00:20:33,720
They all make hundreds
of millions of dollars between them.

313
00:20:33,788 --> 00:20:36,256
This is the largest slaughter
of dolphins in the world.

314
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:37,551
Where are they?

315
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:41,651
There is one organization

316
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:45,221
whose sole purpose is to protect
all cetaceans in the wild.

317
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:46,459
That's the IWC...

318
00:20:46,534 --> 00:20:48,024
the International Whaling Commission.

319
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:49,296
But for some reason,

320
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,136
small cetaceans, dolphins
and porpoises, aren't protected.

321
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:56,108
Dolphins are whales.

322
00:20:56,177 --> 00:20:58,441
Size doesn't matter.

323
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:02,346
The IWC will go down in history
as a ship of fools.

324
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,316
There's no...
There's no democracy here

325
00:21:04,385 --> 00:21:06,512
by any stretch of the imagination.

326
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:08,714
They do whatever the hell
they want to do.

327
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:14,384
Mr. O'Barry, you know I'm here.

328
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:15,519
Yeah?

329
00:21:15,596 --> 00:21:18,121
I have to ask you to leave the hotel.

330
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:19,723
You could have waited
till morning, but...

331
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,735
Sir, I asked you very nicely
to turn off your camera.

332
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:27,103
The reason why small cetaceans
are not popular with the IWC

333
00:21:27,174 --> 00:21:29,802
is because the whaling nations
that set this thing up

334
00:21:29,877 --> 00:21:32,471
clearly has the best interest
in leaving those out,

335
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:34,741
particularly if they
happen to be eating them.

336
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,509
Joji Marshita is the Deputy
Commissioner for Whaling.

337
00:21:40,588 --> 00:21:44,922
He's a talented guy from Japan
with a real hard job to do.

338
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:46,516
He has to get up every day.

339
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:48,323
First he'll look at himself in the mirror,

340
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:49,862
and then he's got to go out

341
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,060
and explain to the world
Japan's whaling policy.

342
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:56,602
Very complicated subject to get around.

343
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,230
It's clear the issue of whaling

344
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:01,501
is becoming more of emotions.

345
00:22:01,575 --> 00:22:05,170
We have never
had a convincing reason

346
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:07,271
why this species is so special.

347
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:28,163
The International
Whaling Commission

348
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:30,465
is the only international body
dealing with whales

349
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:33,233
that's officially recognized
by the United Nations.

350
00:22:33,307 --> 00:22:36,105
It's basically
a toothless organization,

351
00:22:36,176 --> 00:22:38,474
but it is the only
organization that does exist.

352
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:49,314
Well, there's a clause

353
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,221
in the International
Whaling Convention

354
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:54,989
that allows a nation
to take whales for science,

355
00:22:55,062 --> 00:22:58,930
and Japan has decided
that that's its loophole.

356
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:01,467
Currently, Japan
has research programs

357
00:23:01,535 --> 00:23:03,662
that involve killing minke whales,

358
00:23:03,737 --> 00:23:06,934
fin whales, sei whales,
and humpback whales.

359
00:23:07,007 --> 00:23:09,601
Every scientific catch, to me,

360
00:23:09,677 --> 00:23:12,646
is a dark spot on the record
of this commission.

361
00:23:12,713 --> 00:23:17,514
They're talking about
the 1,000 whales in the Antarctic.

362
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:18,983
They're not talking about

363
00:23:19,053 --> 00:23:21,715
the 23,000 over here
being slaughtered.

364
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:23,256
The IWC has presided

365
00:23:23,324 --> 00:23:24,848
over one of the greatest

366
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:26,517
environmental
catastrophes of all time.

367
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:29,289
The reality is the International
Whaling Commission

368
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:31,194
does have a mandate

369
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:33,859
to look at issues
affecting dolphins,

370
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:37,267
but the Japanese are
trying to legitimize a practice

371
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:40,102
that just about every country
in the world has said no to.

372
00:23:40,174 --> 00:23:42,142
Governments are really great

373
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:43,870
at getting together
and holding meetings

374
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:45,536
and conferences
and glad-handing each other,

375
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:47,773
but they never ever seem
to accomplish anything.

376
00:23:47,848 --> 00:23:49,975
It's as Margaret Mead once said...

377
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,541
never ever depend
upon governments or institutions

378
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:54,109
to solve any major problem.

379
00:23:54,188 --> 00:23:56,850
All social change comes
from the passion of individuals.

380
00:23:56,924 --> 00:24:01,190
If saving cetacean
species from extinction

381
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:03,286
relies upon the International
Whaling Commission,

382
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:05,423
then there is no hope.

383
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:14,338
During the Greek era,

384
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:17,707
it was punishable by death
to harm a dolphin.

385
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:18,870
They were protected,

386
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:20,538
and they were protected

387
00:24:20,614 --> 00:24:23,082
because there's a lot
of stories throughout history

388
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,846
of dolphins saving the lives of humans.

389
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:33,758
There's some real magic there
when you're on a wave together.

390
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:35,556
There's this other species

391
00:24:35,629 --> 00:24:38,029
that you can't consciously
communicate with,

392
00:24:38,098 --> 00:24:40,293
and you're both experiencing a thing

393
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:41,959
that's purely for joy

394
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:44,869
beyond the level of survival.

395
00:24:44,938 --> 00:24:48,032
I went surfing
on the east coast of Australia.

396
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:49,803
About half an hour
into the session,

397
00:24:49,877 --> 00:24:51,640
I was sitting
with this friend of mine,

398
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,077
and he goes, "Wait,"

399
00:24:53,147 --> 00:24:56,605
and on the surface of the next wave
was a tiger shark.

400
00:24:56,683 --> 00:25:01,017
Its fins were down,
and it was in the zone.

401
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:03,682
This thing was literally
2 meters away from me,

402
00:25:03,757 --> 00:25:06,248
and I look down, and right there...

403
00:25:06,326 --> 00:25:08,351
it's like in a glass case in a wall...

404
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:10,363
this dolphin comes out of right field

405
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:11,830
and T-bones this shark

406
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:14,333
and pushes it directly
away from me and my buddy.

407
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,762
In that moment...

408
00:25:17,838 --> 00:25:22,036
That's the most obvious demonstration
of the connection in my life.

409
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:26,337
A few years ago,
a friend of mine told me

410
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:29,507
about what was going on in Japan.

411
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:33,212
23,000 are being
wiped out every year,

412
00:25:33,287 --> 00:25:36,017
and it's not even acknowledged.

413
00:25:37,224 --> 00:25:40,625
Nobody has actually seen
what takes place back there,

414
00:25:40,694 --> 00:25:43,561
and so the way to stop it
is to expose it.

415
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,461
They've already told us that...

416
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:46,897
"Don't take pictures."

417
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:48,832
The sign says "Don't take pictures."

418
00:25:48,902 --> 00:25:53,100
And so the way to stop it
is keep exposing this to the world.

419
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:55,368
Eventually,
the Japanese government will say

420
00:25:55,442 --> 00:25:57,842
"Look, this is not working.
It's a PR nightmare."

421
00:25:57,911 --> 00:25:59,435
No! No photograph.

422
00:26:01,115 --> 00:26:03,675
I brought the BBC,
The <i>London Times,</i>

423
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,217
<i>Time</i> Magazine,

424
00:26:05,285 --> 00:26:07,082
and everybody
goes away empty-handed.

425
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:10,088
No photos, okay?

426
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:16,193
They're afraid of cameras.

427
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:18,493
One morning I didn't
have my camera,

428
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:20,089
and a couple guys from the boat,

429
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:22,601
they took a baby dolphin up
and cut its throat.

430
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:25,763
It was already dead,
but they held it up and cut its throat,

431
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,397
and they were just
trying to get me angry,

432
00:26:27,808 --> 00:26:28,638
and I almost hit this guy.

433
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:30,541
He got right in my face.

434
00:26:30,611 --> 00:26:32,135
We called him Private Space.

435
00:26:32,212 --> 00:26:34,874
That's the only two words
he knows in English...

436
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:36,245
private space.

437
00:26:36,316 --> 00:26:37,305
Private!

438
00:26:37,384 --> 00:26:38,874
And he got right in my face,

439
00:26:38,952 --> 00:26:40,442
and he's screaming
at me with a camera.

440
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:41,818
He wanted me to hit him.

441
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:43,413
I mean, he just egged me on,

442
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,515
and I almost... man,
I almost decked this guy

443
00:26:45,592 --> 00:26:47,423
and knocked him off that rock.

444
00:26:47,494 --> 00:26:49,018
That's what they want you to do...

445
00:26:49,096 --> 00:26:52,156
hit them or do something
to get you out of here.

446
00:26:52,232 --> 00:26:53,995
The only way they can
get us out of here

447
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:56,228
is get us arrested and get it on video.

448
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:58,294
I spend most of my time

449
00:26:58,372 --> 00:27:03,309
trying to keep from getting arrested
on bogus charges.

450
00:27:03,377 --> 00:27:04,742
They spend most of their time

451
00:27:04,811 --> 00:27:07,075
trying to arrest us
on bogus charges

452
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:09,115
and get us out of the game.

453
00:27:11,218 --> 00:27:15,086
In 2003, I sent a crew to Taiji.

454
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:17,453
Their objective was to
just get evidence to film

455
00:27:17,524 --> 00:27:19,515
and see what's going on there.

456
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:21,561
They got into the water
and cut the nets

457
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:23,721
and released some
pilot whales and dolphins

458
00:27:23,797 --> 00:27:26,095
and were immediately
arrested for that.

459
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,793
Come on!

460
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:29,165
That actually worked out

461
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:30,533
to show that we were determined

462
00:27:30,604 --> 00:27:32,128
to protect the lives
of these animals,

463
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:34,572
but of course it made it
very difficult to return.

464
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:40,769
In 2007, when I wanted
to do something

465
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:42,610
to expose the issue,

466
00:27:42,683 --> 00:27:43,843
I was shocked

467
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:46,112
that I was the only surfer
in my surfing community

468
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:47,517
that knew about this,

469
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:50,216
so Hayden Panettiere, Isabel Lucas,

470
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,121
we all connected,
and we made the decision,

471
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,784
okay, we're going to paddle out.

472
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,555
No one's
going to be aggressive.

473
00:27:55,629 --> 00:27:58,962
And they got really fired up.

474
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:02,198
We had to pull the pin.

475
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:03,566
There was nothing we could do,

476
00:28:03,637 --> 00:28:05,764
nothing more we could do
in that scenario.

477
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:16,811
You see, this is like
a cat and mouse game.

478
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:18,043
Those particular activists,

479
00:28:18,118 --> 00:28:21,019
they were arrested right here
in this very spot.

480
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:22,646
Now they can never come back.

481
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:24,190
They're out of the game.

482
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,357
My heart went out to them.

483
00:28:28,428 --> 00:28:30,658
I watched <i>Flipper</i> as a child.

484
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:32,631
I grew to love the oceans
partly because of <i>Flipper</i>.

485
00:28:32,699 --> 00:28:34,428
We are going to stop this.

486
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:36,401
We're going to stop this.

487
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,961
And here's the guy that started it all.

488
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,269
He's trying to rectify
this huge problem,

489
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:43,332
but he can't find
anybody to help him.

490
00:28:44,544 --> 00:28:47,479
If we could just get in there,
we can stop this.

491
00:28:51,018 --> 00:28:53,919
The first guy I called was
my buddy Charles Hambleton.

492
00:28:53,987 --> 00:28:56,114
He's a adrenaline junkie.

493
00:28:56,189 --> 00:28:58,248
He's been sail master on
<i>The Pirates of the Caribbean</i>.

494
00:28:58,325 --> 00:29:00,885
He's traveled all over the world
on photo assignments.

495
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:02,792
He's the guy that has a heart of gold

496
00:29:02,863 --> 00:29:04,854
and nerves of steel.
He'll do anything.

497
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:10,964
I remember distinctly a phone call

498
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:13,336
saying I needed to be in Japan.

499
00:29:14,574 --> 00:29:16,701
We stepped off the train in Taiji,

500
00:29:16,777 --> 00:29:19,302
and we were immediately
met by Ric O'Barry,

501
00:29:19,379 --> 00:29:21,438
along with the police.

502
00:29:21,515 --> 00:29:22,914
I'm not entirely sure

503
00:29:22,983 --> 00:29:25,042
Louis knew what he was
getting himself into.

504
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,019
On our initial trip to Japan,

505
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:31,421
we had a formal meeting
in the town mayor's office

506
00:29:31,491 --> 00:29:32,788
with the fishing union

507
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:35,054
and with all the proper authorities.

508
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:39,030
We spent seven hours
trying to negotiate an arrangement

509
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:40,794
where we would try to be
respectful of their side.

510
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:43,961
That was the point to me,
is get both sides.

511
00:29:44,037 --> 00:29:48,474
And we started to realize
that they were hiding something.

512
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,840
You have to get permission
to get a permit

513
00:29:50,911 --> 00:29:52,173
to get permission to do...

514
00:29:52,245 --> 00:29:55,737
and nobody wants to do
anything without permission.

515
00:29:55,816 --> 00:29:58,478
After two days of negotiations,

516
00:29:58,552 --> 00:30:00,986
they said, "We're not
going to let you do it,"

517
00:30:01,054 --> 00:30:02,783
and they put a map on the table

518
00:30:02,856 --> 00:30:04,983
and pointed with these
red X's on the map.

519
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:07,549
and said, "Don't go here,
don't go here,

520
00:30:07,627 --> 00:30:09,254
don't go here, don't go here."

521
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:10,523
And then Charles said...

522
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:12,724
"Could we just hang on
to that for reference,

523
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,267
just so we know where
we're not supposed to be?"

524
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:16,563
That kind of thing.

525
00:30:16,636 --> 00:30:21,664
And that became sort of our template
of where we had to go.

526
00:30:27,848 --> 00:30:30,874
The secret cove is a natural fortress.

527
00:30:30,951 --> 00:30:34,717
It's surrounded on three sides
by steep cliffs.

528
00:30:36,523 --> 00:30:37,785
There are several tunnels

529
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:39,723
that you need to get
through to get there.

530
00:30:41,128 --> 00:30:44,996
High fences surrounded
by razor ribbon.

531
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:51,535
I've traveled all over the world
throughout my entire life,

532
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:54,597
and the coastline is majestic.

533
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:58,872
It's astounding to think
that this horror happens

534
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:01,812
in one of the most beautiful places.

535
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:05,280
We snuck up to this park.

536
00:31:05,352 --> 00:31:06,819
It was called Tsunami Park.

537
00:31:06,887 --> 00:31:09,151
It was blockaded,
but we went up there.

538
00:31:09,222 --> 00:31:11,816
The only safe time
to go in Tsunami Park

539
00:31:11,892 --> 00:31:14,087
is when there are no
dolphins in the lagoon.

540
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:16,493
Then there are no guards around.

541
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:19,691
Ric pointed down
to the secret lagoon,

542
00:31:19,766 --> 00:31:23,133
and he said, "That's
where all the dirty business happens."

543
00:31:23,203 --> 00:31:24,795
The cops were on our tail,

544
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:26,600
and I thought, let's get out of here.

545
00:31:26,673 --> 00:31:27,833
We'll try to regroup.

546
00:31:27,908 --> 00:31:30,934
So we went off to do
some sightseeing outside Taiji.

547
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,639
All these beautiful
temples are there,

548
00:31:35,715 --> 00:31:38,445
some of the most beautiful
temples in all of Japan.

549
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,745
In one of these temples,
they have a dry rock garden

550
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:44,654
where the monks rake these rocks,

551
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:46,715
and in the center
they have these rocks

552
00:31:46,793 --> 00:31:49,956
that people come from all
over the world to contemplate.

553
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,190
It was gorgeous,

554
00:31:51,264 --> 00:31:52,822
but I thought, in America,

555
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:57,268
people would never go
on a Sunday to watch rocks.

556
00:31:58,705 --> 00:32:01,367
Suddenly I got this idea.

557
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:03,636
What if the rocks looked back?

558
00:32:11,184 --> 00:32:13,778
This was a big waterfall set

559
00:32:13,854 --> 00:32:16,721
that we constructed
for the movie <i>Evan Almighty</i>.

560
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,781
A dam breaks and floods

561
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:20,884
and takes the...
washes the road out and...

562
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:22,952
One of my best friends
and my first assistant

563
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:24,997
was a guy that became
the head mold maker

564
00:32:25,065 --> 00:32:26,555
at Industrial Light and Magic,

565
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:30,160
so I called up and said,
"I've got this idea for a project.

566
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:32,398
"I want to hide
Hi-Def cameras in a rock.

567
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:33,530
Can you help us?"

568
00:32:37,944 --> 00:32:40,174
Is that what you had in mind?

569
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:41,578
It's a work of art, man.

570
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:43,548
We can do all of them
brown if you want,

571
00:32:43,617 --> 00:32:45,812
or we can do a combination
of brown and gray.

572
00:32:45,886 --> 00:32:47,615
I think brown and gray
would be better.

573
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:49,951
I think this is going
to be a primary for us

574
00:32:50,023 --> 00:32:51,183
that these are all gray.

575
00:32:51,258 --> 00:32:52,555
I would try to keep them

576
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:54,389
as lower of a profile
as possible because...

577
00:32:54,461 --> 00:32:56,486
We needed a special group of people

578
00:32:56,563 --> 00:32:57,860
to implement this mission.

579
00:32:57,931 --> 00:33:01,332
We needed people with
a special set of skills.

580
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:02,925
I started to set up this team,

581
00:33:03,003 --> 00:33:05,164
this... sort of this
<i>Ocean's Eleven</i> team.

582
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:08,034
Simon Hutchins,

583
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:09,837
the only guy that had
military experience.

584
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,538
Simon created all these weird ways

585
00:33:12,612 --> 00:33:14,773
to hide Hi-Def cameras
and hydrophones.

586
00:33:14,848 --> 00:33:16,873
You know, he's a mad genius.

587
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,884
If we could dream it,
Simon could build it.

588
00:33:20,353 --> 00:33:22,218
Joe Chisolm organized rock concerts,

589
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:24,257
and we were kind of like
a rock concert...

590
00:33:24,324 --> 00:33:25,552
you know, incognito.

591
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:29,117
You know, we had hundreds
of cases of material

592
00:33:29,195 --> 00:33:30,787
that we had to import into Japan,

593
00:33:30,864 --> 00:33:32,525
and he did the logistics.

594
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,157
Louis came back, and he said, "Look,

595
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:35,292
we got to get in,"

596
00:33:35,368 --> 00:33:36,665
and Louis and I started discussing

597
00:33:36,736 --> 00:33:38,727
all of the ways that we can film it.

598
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:41,638
We had a military grade
thermal camera,

599
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,767
which you're not allowed
to bring out of the country.

600
00:33:43,843 --> 00:33:46,311
If it has a pulse,
the thermal camera picks it up.

601
00:33:46,379 --> 00:33:49,644
One thing that we had decided to do
is get some aerial footage,

602
00:33:49,716 --> 00:33:53,208
so we decided to take
our own helicopter with us.

603
00:33:53,286 --> 00:33:56,221
We looked into, you know,
commandeering a satellite

604
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:57,916
to do satellite pictures.

605
00:33:57,991 --> 00:34:01,222
We decided to make
our own unmanned drone

606
00:34:01,294 --> 00:34:04,263
with a gyro-stabilized
Hi-Def camera below it.

607
00:34:04,331 --> 00:34:06,265
We actually named it Cathy,

608
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:09,097
and that was purely
out of respect for Ric O'Barry.

609
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:10,568
The idea there was

610
00:34:10,637 --> 00:34:15,074
that even if the blimp didn't succeed
and we got caught

611
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:17,803
that everybody loves a balloon...

612
00:34:17,877 --> 00:34:20,038
you know, kids, police, everyone.

613
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:25,383
One of these devices
that was very important to Louis and I

614
00:34:25,452 --> 00:34:27,511
is the hydrophone...
high tech sound devices

615
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:29,282
put in underwater housing.

616
00:34:29,356 --> 00:34:31,324
I wanted to hear
the dolphins from the lagoon,

617
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:33,086
but we didn't know
how deep it was.

618
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,251
We had rebreathers,

619
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:35,851
but it would be clanky,
it would be noisy.

620
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:39,262
Mandy-Rae Cruickshank and Kirk Krack

621
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:42,096
are world class freedivers.

622
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:43,965
Freediving in its simplest terms,

623
00:34:44,037 --> 00:34:46,005
it's like deep snorkeling.

624
00:34:46,072 --> 00:34:48,438
On one breath we see
how deep we can go in the ocean,

625
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:50,305
how long we can hold our breath.

626
00:34:50,377 --> 00:34:51,503
Mandy-Rae's owned

627
00:34:51,578 --> 00:34:53,341
eight world championships
in her lifetime.

628
00:34:53,413 --> 00:34:57,110
She can go down to 300 feet
on one breath of air

629
00:34:57,183 --> 00:34:58,810
and come back on her own power.

630
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:04,680
They got on board pretty quickly

631
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:06,692
when they found out
what we wanted to do.

632
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:16,802
We have some of the same
physiological traits

633
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,395
that whales, seals,
and dolphins have.

634
00:35:19,472 --> 00:35:21,133
We're all air-breathing mammals.

635
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:23,573
They live in the water.
We live on land.

636
00:35:26,746 --> 00:35:28,646
When you're out
swimming in the ocean

637
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:31,479
and you have whales
and dolphins come by you,

638
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:35,681
it is one of the most
incredible experiences ever.

639
00:35:35,755 --> 00:35:39,088
It's so humbling that this wild creature

640
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,992
would come up and be
so interested in you.

641
00:35:42,062 --> 00:35:43,495
It's...

642
00:35:43,563 --> 00:35:45,861
It's unbelievable, really.

643
00:35:49,602 --> 00:35:53,163
Even though there's
obviously no words spoken,

644
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:57,141
you really feel like you're on some
level communicating with them,

645
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,907
like there's an understanding
between the two of you.

646
00:36:06,753 --> 00:36:09,381
I don't normally touch
anything in the water,

647
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:10,787
but I just thought, you know,

648
00:36:10,857 --> 00:36:12,825
it had been swimming
with me for so long,

649
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:14,860
I put my hand out in front of me,

650
00:36:14,928 --> 00:36:16,452
and it rolled right into my hand,

651
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:18,224
and it just stayed there
in front of me,

652
00:36:18,298 --> 00:36:19,595
letting me rub its belly.

653
00:36:21,735 --> 00:36:23,293
Here you have this dolphin,

654
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:25,667
wild and on its own terms,

655
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:29,470
come up and really
seek out affection and touch.

656
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:31,737
It really wanted to be with us.

657
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:35,039
When they asked us

658
00:36:35,115 --> 00:36:38,846
if we wanted to partake
in a secret ops mission

659
00:36:38,918 --> 00:36:41,250
to uncover the dolphin slaughter,

660
00:36:41,321 --> 00:36:43,380
we without hesitation said,
"Absolutely. Sign us up.

661
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:45,356
What can we do?"

662
00:36:49,763 --> 00:36:51,094
- This is what...

663
00:36:53,233 --> 00:36:54,257
It's so cool.

664
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:55,426
Yeah.

665
00:36:55,502 --> 00:36:57,834
I'm just a cute little innocent rock.

666
00:36:57,904 --> 00:36:59,371
Getting these into Customs

667
00:36:59,439 --> 00:37:01,304
is going to be the trick, I think, next.

668
00:37:01,374 --> 00:37:03,308
I hope we'll be able
to find them again

669
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:04,604
once we plant them.

670
00:37:04,677 --> 00:37:07,168
Actually, come back to the hotel
and we have real rocks.

671
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:24,685
There's 47 suitcases.

672
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:27,631
I don't think they're going
to let us carry this on.

673
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:48,413
We definitely were trying
to be as discreet as possible,

674
00:37:48,488 --> 00:37:52,254
but there's nothing discreet
about Westerners

675
00:37:52,325 --> 00:37:56,284
in a place where there are
no Westerners with big black cases,

676
00:37:56,362 --> 00:37:58,523
and it was noted.

677
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,631
Well, now, there's a car here.

678
00:38:02,702 --> 00:38:04,670
Just... I just got here yesterday.

679
00:38:04,737 --> 00:38:06,830
You think... Do you think
they know we're here?

680
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:10,570
You do?

681
00:38:12,478 --> 00:38:14,571
First morning we arrived in Taiji,

682
00:38:14,647 --> 00:38:16,581
Ric O'Barry met us at our hotel.

683
00:38:16,649 --> 00:38:18,617
He decided that it would
be a good idea

684
00:38:18,685 --> 00:38:20,209
if he'd take us on a tour

685
00:38:20,286 --> 00:38:21,913
so we got the lay of the land.

686
00:38:21,988 --> 00:38:23,387
So we all get in the vehicles,

687
00:38:23,456 --> 00:38:25,754
and one of the first
things we noticed

688
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:28,555
was that we got an escort.

689
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:36,159
This is the butcher shop right here,

690
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:37,760
the slaughterhouse.

691
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:39,498
This is the union right here,

692
00:38:39,572 --> 00:38:41,369
and there's Private Space.

693
00:38:49,115 --> 00:38:50,582
When we first got in the country,

694
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,811
we had no idea
who was following us.

695
00:38:52,886 --> 00:38:56,185
There was about seven or eight cars
that we had license plates,

696
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,884
so we knew that we were being
followed by these people.

697
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:00,687
We didn't know
if it was the whalers.

698
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,695
We didn't know if it was Yakuza,
the Japanese Mafia.

699
00:39:03,763 --> 00:39:05,924
We had no idea.

700
00:39:07,033 --> 00:39:08,796
I'd met this guy that spoke English.

701
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:10,233
He was from
the Whaling Museum,

702
00:39:10,303 --> 00:39:13,170
and I asked him, "Do you know
who's in that car over there?"

703
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:16,504
He looks over there, and he goes,
"Chief of Police."

704
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:21,171
If you're around Ric,
they... they know you're trouble.

705
00:39:54,414 --> 00:39:56,678
Our first encounter
with the fishermen

706
00:39:56,749 --> 00:39:59,741
was they went down there
at first break of light,

707
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:01,514
and as soon as we arrived,

708
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:03,418
a number of fishermen showed up.

709
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:07,826
We were down by the beach
looking at...

710
00:40:07,894 --> 00:40:10,658
You could see the blood
coming out of the killing lagoon.

711
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,459
You could see a bunch of the babies

712
00:40:12,532 --> 00:40:14,864
were cordoned off by themselves
away from their parents

713
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:16,959
while their parents
were all being slaughtered.

714
00:40:19,872 --> 00:40:24,502
And so I wanted to get
a better look into the lagoon,

715
00:40:24,577 --> 00:40:28,138
and as Joe and I tried
to walk down this path,

716
00:40:28,214 --> 00:40:31,377
some of the fishermen came
and actually butted chest against us.

717
00:40:32,552 --> 00:40:34,179
Don't touch the girl.

718
00:40:35,555 --> 00:40:36,852
Trying to stop us

719
00:40:36,923 --> 00:40:39,153
from getting that vantage
point on the killing.

720
00:40:39,225 --> 00:40:41,159
And just after that,

721
00:40:41,227 --> 00:40:43,695
We walked down
to the water's edge,

722
00:40:43,763 --> 00:40:46,789
and this one poor dolphin, it...

723
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:49,096
You could see it
trying to get away,

724
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:51,398
and it was swimming
straight for us and the shore,

725
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:54,406
and it actually made it
over a couple of the nets,

726
00:40:54,474 --> 00:40:56,499
and every time
it came up for a breath,

727
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,636
you could see all this blood
coming out behind it,

728
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:02,738
and you could see
the last couple of breaths it took,

729
00:41:02,815 --> 00:41:05,443
and then it went down,
and we never saw it again.

730
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:53,396
Bye-bye-bye-bye.

731
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,729
It's a relatively small group of people
who are doing this.

732
00:42:01,808 --> 00:42:03,901
Outside these few remote villages,

733
00:42:03,976 --> 00:42:07,935
most of the population
doesn't even know this is going on.

734
00:42:09,749 --> 00:42:12,946
The fishermen here who do this
tell you "This is our tradition.

735
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:14,543
"This is our culture.

736
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,882
"You don't understand us.

737
00:42:15,955 --> 00:42:18,515
You eat cows.
Well, we eat dolphins."

738
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:22,049
Well, the truth is that's the big lie.

739
00:42:22,128 --> 00:42:24,153
How can it be their culture, their tradition,

740
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:27,927
if the Japanese people
don't even know about it?

741
00:42:29,235 --> 00:42:33,262
23,000 dolphins
are killed for meat every year.

742
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,972
You never heard of it?

743
00:43:05,872 --> 00:43:08,500
People in Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo...

744
00:43:08,574 --> 00:43:10,974
the reason they don't know about it

745
00:43:11,043 --> 00:43:13,637
is because of a media cover-up,

746
00:43:13,713 --> 00:43:16,204
a systematic, deliberate cover-up,

747
00:43:16,282 --> 00:43:18,341
a media blackout,

748
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:23,218
because the dolphin meat
is heavily laced with mercury.

749
00:43:36,402 --> 00:43:37,926
Mercury starts in the environment

750
00:43:38,004 --> 00:43:39,869
with the smallest of organisms,

751
00:43:39,939 --> 00:43:41,964
and every step of the ladder up,

752
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:44,236
it gets magnified about ten times...

753
00:43:45,378 --> 00:43:48,142
until the top of the food chain,

754
00:43:48,214 --> 00:43:50,910
where you get these
incredibly toxic levels.

755
00:43:50,983 --> 00:43:53,349
All the fish that we love most to eat...

756
00:43:53,419 --> 00:43:55,649
things like striped bass, bluefish,

757
00:43:55,721 --> 00:43:57,916
tuna, swordfish, marlin...

758
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:00,982
this is a major source of mercury,

759
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,359
and these substances
are causing real problems,

760
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,694
not just to dolphins, but to people,

761
00:44:06,766 --> 00:44:09,701
because people and dolphins feed

762
00:44:09,769 --> 00:44:12,670
at the same level of a food chain.

763
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:15,298
If you looked at bottlenose dolphins...

764
00:44:15,374 --> 00:44:17,205
that's Flipper, by the way...

765
00:44:17,276 --> 00:44:19,801
you'd discover, in fact,

766
00:44:19,879 --> 00:44:23,838
these animals are swimming
toxic dump sites.

767
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:28,376
It's better to refrain
from taking those meats...

768
00:44:29,822 --> 00:44:30,811
how do I say?

769
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:31,982
Too much.

770
00:44:32,225 --> 00:44:38,221
But still dolphin meat
contains some valuable nutrients.

771
00:44:38,297 --> 00:44:39,559
This is a matter

772
00:44:39,632 --> 00:44:44,126
that the consumer affairs
and health ministries are looking after,

773
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:48,105
and I can assure you
that there is no product on the market

774
00:44:48,174 --> 00:44:51,371
that exceeds any of their standards.

775
00:44:51,444 --> 00:44:54,106
By their standards.

776
00:45:22,408 --> 00:45:25,605
Almost nobody eats dolphin meat,

777
00:45:25,678 --> 00:45:29,944
but 23,000 are slaughtered every year,

778
00:45:30,016 --> 00:45:31,643
so that begs the question,

779
00:45:31,717 --> 00:45:34,311
Where is all this meat going?

780
00:45:36,622 --> 00:45:40,388
Dolphin meat is generally considered
to be a less desirable commodity,

781
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:43,519
and it would sell for far, far less
if it was properly labeled.

782
00:45:43,596 --> 00:45:48,363
So the meat is distributed
much more widely than we recognize.

783
00:45:48,434 --> 00:45:51,028
Scott Baker set up a portable DNA lab

784
00:45:51,103 --> 00:45:53,128
at a hotel in downtown Tokyo.

785
00:45:53,205 --> 00:45:55,969
We brought him samples,
and he analyzed them

786
00:45:56,042 --> 00:45:58,306
and found that
a lot of the packages

787
00:45:58,377 --> 00:46:00,777
that were labeled
as expensive meat from larger whales

788
00:46:00,846 --> 00:46:02,370
was actually dolphin meat.

789
00:46:02,448 --> 00:46:05,542
A consumer may think
they're buying healthy meat

790
00:46:05,618 --> 00:46:07,483
from whales from
the southern hemisphere,

791
00:46:07,553 --> 00:46:09,817
and they might be getting
a bottlenose dolphin

792
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:11,151
from the coast of Taiji

793
00:46:11,223 --> 00:46:14,818
with levels of mercury
that are 20 times higher

794
00:46:14,894 --> 00:46:17,294
than World Health
Organization recommendations.

795
00:46:17,363 --> 00:46:19,126
The fishermen
who are eating dolphin

796
00:46:19,198 --> 00:46:20,688
are poisoning themselves,

797
00:46:20,766 --> 00:46:22,233
but they're also poisoning

798
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:24,326
the people that they're selling it to.

799
00:46:24,403 --> 00:46:25,870
And the government knows this,

800
00:46:25,938 --> 00:46:27,371
and the government's covering this up.

801
00:46:29,942 --> 00:46:34,208
They had this problem
once before in Minamata.

802
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,841
That's where mercury poisoning
was first discovered.

803
00:46:39,018 --> 00:46:41,782
They called it Minamata disease.

804
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,516
Japan has a history
of this terrible Minamata tragedy,

805
00:47:11,584 --> 00:47:14,075
sometimes referred to
as Minamata disease.

806
00:47:14,153 --> 00:47:16,417
But it's not a disease. It's not caught.

807
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:19,219
It's the result of this toxicity.

808
00:47:21,927 --> 00:47:24,987
The most serious health risk
of these high levels of mercury

809
00:47:25,064 --> 00:47:26,224
is to pregnant women.

810
00:47:26,298 --> 00:47:29,233
It's the fetus that's most sensitive
to these levels of mercury.

811
00:47:51,891 --> 00:47:55,383
The children were
starting to be born deformed.

812
00:47:55,461 --> 00:47:57,361
And it's going to happen again.

813
00:47:59,665 --> 00:48:02,566
Nobody has really looked
into the hospitals,

814
00:48:02,635 --> 00:48:04,432
looked into the records

815
00:48:04,503 --> 00:48:07,666
to see how many people
there have mercury poisoning.

816
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,140
The symptoms are memory loss,

817
00:48:10,209 --> 00:48:13,269
loss of hearing,
loss of your eyesight.

818
00:48:13,345 --> 00:48:15,506
It doesn't just knock you over dead.

819
00:48:15,581 --> 00:48:17,378
It takes a while.

820
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:18,815
And that's happening.

821
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,753
Does he want to know
if he's poisoning the bodies

822
00:48:22,822 --> 00:48:24,687
of other Japanese
that he's selling the meat to?

823
00:48:24,757 --> 00:48:26,019
He doesn't want to know.

824
00:48:26,091 --> 00:48:28,082
He doesn't want to know about it.

825
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,424
Well, in Minamata,
the government said

826
00:48:30,496 --> 00:48:32,555
they weren't poisoning the people
in Minamata, either.

827
00:48:32,631 --> 00:48:33,859
Remember that?

828
00:48:33,933 --> 00:48:35,195
The Chisso factory?

829
00:48:36,235 --> 00:48:37,224
The Chisso factory?

830
00:48:37,303 --> 00:48:39,032
Same thing, same problem.

831
00:48:39,104 --> 00:48:41,072
You don't think there's
a cover-up going on

832
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,869
with the amount of mercury
in dolphin meat?

833
00:48:42,942 --> 00:48:46,469
I don't think that a similar
tragedy would happen

834
00:48:46,545 --> 00:48:48,308
because of the dolphin meat.

835
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,007
I don't think so.

836
00:48:51,984 --> 00:48:53,679
Ultimately, the dolphin meat

837
00:48:53,752 --> 00:48:56,380
is based on supply and demand
like any other product,

838
00:48:56,455 --> 00:48:59,083
and if that product is poison

839
00:48:59,158 --> 00:49:01,023
and they can't sell it in Taiji,

840
00:49:01,093 --> 00:49:02,924
then they can't sell it in Iwate,

841
00:49:02,995 --> 00:49:04,622
and they can't sell it in Okinawa,

842
00:49:04,697 --> 00:49:07,063
and they can't sell it wherever else
they're selling it.

843
00:49:07,132 --> 00:49:11,626
So you have to stay focused
on that one lagoon in Taiji, I think,

844
00:49:11,704 --> 00:49:14,002
in order to shut this down.

845
00:49:16,675 --> 00:49:18,666
Howdy. How are you doing today?

846
00:49:25,084 --> 00:49:28,520
If we got arrested,
how long before they charged us?

847
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:30,555
They don't have to
charge you with anything.

848
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,147
The way the law works in Japan,

849
00:49:32,224 --> 00:49:35,887
they can keep you in jail
with no charges for 28 days.

850
00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:39,453
90% of the convictions in Japan

851
00:49:39,532 --> 00:49:43,366
are obtained by confessions
during those 28 days

852
00:49:43,435 --> 00:49:45,562
because they can
torture you legally.

853
00:49:45,638 --> 00:49:48,038
They can wake you up
in the middle of the night,

854
00:49:48,107 --> 00:49:49,404
all night long, you know, and...

855
00:49:49,475 --> 00:49:51,204
I've been doing that to them all week.

856
00:49:51,277 --> 00:49:52,266
That may be aggressive...

857
00:49:52,344 --> 00:49:53,402
Can we prosecute him?

858
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:57,009
I came to realize

859
00:49:57,082 --> 00:49:59,778
that this was going to be
a much longer process,

860
00:49:59,852 --> 00:50:04,221
so we utilized our time over there
doing reconnaissance, planning.

861
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,349
We observed.

862
00:50:06,425 --> 00:50:09,087
There's two crews
that went in last night...

863
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:11,026
the guys that come
out of the tunnel.

864
00:50:11,096 --> 00:50:13,030
They're sent to look on the left side.

865
00:50:13,098 --> 00:50:15,066
They shine their flashlights.
They go pretty quick

866
00:50:15,134 --> 00:50:17,227
because they want
to get to work and start out.

867
00:50:17,303 --> 00:50:19,294
What they're doing is looking
for little snap branches.

868
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:21,737
They normally go up there

869
00:50:21,807 --> 00:50:23,434
when they have dolphins
in the lagoon.

870
00:50:23,509 --> 00:50:25,477
They go up and see if anybody's
photographed them.

871
00:50:25,544 --> 00:50:27,273
What I'm thinking
is we go in there.

872
00:50:27,346 --> 00:50:29,405
Maybe I use that location
that has a branch,

873
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:32,473
and I cut the branch on a night
when there's no dolphins.

874
00:50:32,551 --> 00:50:34,678
There was two parts to the mission.

875
00:50:34,753 --> 00:50:37,381
The first one was to get
the auditory experience.

876
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:40,391
Where can we drop a big
housing skull like this

877
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:42,689
with arms sticking out?
Let's try getting that.

878
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:45,389
We could plant hydrophones
on the side of the lagoon

879
00:50:45,464 --> 00:50:47,159
that was easiest to get into.

880
00:50:47,232 --> 00:50:49,860
It's a lot easier getting down
the left side of the lagoon.

881
00:50:49,935 --> 00:50:53,393
The right side is right in the center
of the killing cove.

882
00:50:53,472 --> 00:50:54,905
I go first with the thermal camera.

883
00:50:54,974 --> 00:50:56,942
I can tell if there's
any movement over there.

884
00:50:57,009 --> 00:50:58,306
If they're hiding in the bushes,

885
00:50:58,377 --> 00:50:59,674
they're going to be popping out.

886
00:50:59,745 --> 00:51:02,270
So the hydrophone was
sort of a trial run

887
00:51:02,348 --> 00:51:03,815
to see if we could get away with it.

888
00:51:03,882 --> 00:51:05,349
You guys go in with two cameras, right?

889
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:06,406
Three cameras.

890
00:51:06,485 --> 00:51:07,509
The second mission,

891
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:09,451
what we call the full orchestra.

892
00:51:09,521 --> 00:51:11,079
Let's go, then, with three cameras...

893
00:51:11,156 --> 00:51:12,521
you're 2, you're 1...

894
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:13,956
and think about fourth.

895
00:51:14,026 --> 00:51:15,618
We would plant all the rocks,

896
00:51:15,694 --> 00:51:18,162
the hydrophones, underwater cameras.

897
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,791
They have scuba divers,
so they just sweep.

898
00:51:21,867 --> 00:51:23,801
They're straining the bottom of that bay,

899
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:25,700
so we don't want them to
pick up underwater cameras.

900
00:51:25,771 --> 00:51:28,035
Once you get right here, you're safe.

901
00:51:28,107 --> 00:51:30,473
This is the first sign
that says "Do not enter."

902
00:51:30,542 --> 00:51:32,442
- We don't know what it says.
- "Danger."

903
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:33,637
We have no idea.

904
00:51:33,712 --> 00:51:35,680
It says "Welcome to Taiji"
for all we know.

905
00:51:35,748 --> 00:51:37,079
"Enjoy our wonderful UNESCO site."

906
00:51:37,149 --> 00:51:39,583
I wanted to have
a three-dimensional experience

907
00:51:39,652 --> 00:51:41,586
with what's going on in that lagoon.

908
00:51:41,654 --> 00:51:44,487
I wanted to hear everything
that the dolphins were doing,

909
00:51:44,556 --> 00:51:46,183
everything that the whalers were saying.

910
00:51:46,258 --> 00:51:50,194
The effort wasn't just
to show the slaughter.

911
00:51:50,262 --> 00:51:53,857
You want to capture something
that will make people change.

912
00:51:55,367 --> 00:51:59,497
This weekend, the thin, mournful cry
of the humpback whale

913
00:51:59,571 --> 00:52:02,005
echoed through London's
Trafalgar Square,

914
00:52:02,074 --> 00:52:03,837
as thousands of demonstrators

915
00:52:03,909 --> 00:52:06,503
demanded an end to all whale killing.

916
00:52:06,578 --> 00:52:08,011
In the 1960s,

917
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,479
when the IWC wasn't doing anything

918
00:52:09,548 --> 00:52:11,311
about the slaughter of large whales,

919
00:52:11,383 --> 00:52:12,748
there was one guy, Roger Payne,

920
00:52:12,818 --> 00:52:14,718
who helped start the whole
Save the Whale movement

921
00:52:14,787 --> 00:52:15,879
by exposing to the world

922
00:52:15,954 --> 00:52:17,114
that these animals were singing.

923
00:52:17,189 --> 00:52:18,850
That was profound.

924
00:52:18,924 --> 00:52:20,084
What do we want?

925
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:21,251
Save the whales!

926
00:52:21,326 --> 00:52:22,588
When do we want it?

927
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:25,221
Save the Whale demonstrators
were out again today.

928
00:52:25,297 --> 00:52:27,993
And they are determined to see
that something be done about it.

929
00:52:28,067 --> 00:52:31,969
At the time, about 33,000 whales
a year were being killed.

930
00:52:32,037 --> 00:52:36,565
We got it down eventually
to about 330, 1% of that amount.

931
00:52:36,642 --> 00:52:40,009
It's now going back up again.

932
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,344
There has to be a new generation
that takes over from here.

933
00:52:43,415 --> 00:52:46,043
There's only so many Ric O'Barrys
and Roger Paynes.

934
00:52:46,118 --> 00:52:47,915
They're all in their 60s and 70s now,

935
00:52:47,986 --> 00:52:50,511
and there's not a lot
of people out there

936
00:52:50,589 --> 00:52:52,420
picking up where they've left off.

937
00:52:59,465 --> 00:53:00,796
I like this.

938
00:53:00,866 --> 00:53:03,562
It sinks very slowly, this line.

939
00:53:03,635 --> 00:53:04,795
It does sink, but it's very slow,

940
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:07,100
so I just put a couple weights on it.

941
00:53:07,172 --> 00:53:09,970
We're going to have these two
hydrophones connected to it.

942
00:53:10,042 --> 00:53:11,976
- One thing, though.
- Yeah.

943
00:53:12,044 --> 00:53:13,409
I took all the other stickers off, see?

944
00:53:13,479 --> 00:53:14,468
Go on the...

945
00:53:14,546 --> 00:53:15,604
"Please return dry."

946
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:16,875
Yeah, let's take the sticker off.

947
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:17,938
Okay? Jesus.

948
00:53:19,017 --> 00:53:24,319
(03) 3224-5000.

949
00:53:25,324 --> 00:53:28,521
That's the cell phone number
for the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo

950
00:53:28,594 --> 00:53:33,725
as well as the cell phone numbers
of our other two phones,

951
00:53:33,799 --> 00:53:37,257
just in case something shits the bed.

952
00:53:39,571 --> 00:53:42,335
When we very discreetly
leave the hotel room

953
00:53:42,407 --> 00:53:45,535
with four or five guys
dressed in black

954
00:53:45,611 --> 00:53:47,636
with camera equipment,

955
00:53:47,713 --> 00:53:49,442
we have it timed really well.

956
00:53:49,515 --> 00:53:51,210
We know when the guard turns up.

957
00:53:51,283 --> 00:53:53,751
We know how far the cop
is going to be behind us.

958
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:55,514
We know how long
it takes the cops

959
00:53:55,587 --> 00:53:57,987
to get from the next village there.

960
00:53:58,056 --> 00:54:00,650
It was probably
the scariest night of my life

961
00:54:00,726 --> 00:54:02,455
because we'd been up
many days in a row

962
00:54:02,528 --> 00:54:03,586
preparing for this.

963
00:54:03,662 --> 00:54:05,425
We're exposed out there.

964
00:54:05,497 --> 00:54:07,692
There's very few places we could hide.

965
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:34,941
Joe.

966
00:56:55,834 --> 00:56:57,062
Here you go.

967
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,831
Come on. Let's go. Go.

968
00:57:00,939 --> 00:57:02,463
Holy Christ.

969
00:57:03,976 --> 00:57:05,102
Nice work.

970
00:57:05,177 --> 00:57:06,974
Jesus.

971
00:57:08,413 --> 00:57:10,278
100% of the people in the vehicle?

972
00:57:10,349 --> 00:57:11,839
It's a good night.

973
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:13,214
That's a good night.

974
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,149
Me?

975
00:57:24,196 --> 00:57:25,527
I don't know.

976
00:57:25,597 --> 00:57:26,689
I don't know.

977
00:57:26,765 --> 00:57:27,789
Not me.

978
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:29,800
At midnight, I'm sleeping.

979
00:57:39,244 --> 00:57:40,233
I don't know.

980
00:57:40,312 --> 00:57:41,609
I cannot speak for OPS.

981
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,274
I can only speak for Ric O'Barry.

982
00:57:44,349 --> 00:57:47,409
I cannot speak
for anybody except myself.

983
00:57:47,486 --> 00:57:49,579
At midnight, I'm sleeping.

984
00:57:49,654 --> 00:57:50,916
No, no, no.

985
00:57:52,257 --> 00:57:53,588
I don't know.

986
00:57:54,893 --> 00:57:56,155
I'm not OPS.

987
00:57:56,228 --> 00:57:57,957
I'm not OPS, no.

988
00:57:59,398 --> 00:58:00,524
Well, I do interviews.

989
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:02,362
Anybody who wants to talk to me,

990
00:58:02,434 --> 00:58:03,924
- I will talk to them.
- Yes?

991
00:58:04,002 --> 00:58:07,096
OPS wants to talk to me,
I talk to them.

992
00:58:07,172 --> 00:58:09,970
I talk to anybody
about mercury poisoning.

993
00:58:13,145 --> 00:58:14,339
- Thank you.
- Okay.

994
00:58:14,413 --> 00:58:15,778
Thank you so much for your time.

995
00:58:15,847 --> 00:58:17,781
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

996
00:58:27,926 --> 00:58:31,953
I think the most horrifying thing
about the whole dive that night

997
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,520
was that, you know,
you could hear them

998
00:58:33,598 --> 00:58:35,896
communicating with each other,

999
00:58:35,967 --> 00:58:39,801
and you knew that that next morning
that would be the end of it.

1000
00:58:39,871 --> 00:58:42,066
They'd be silenced forever.

1001
00:58:44,376 --> 00:58:47,743
They're always trying
to communicate with us,

1002
00:58:47,813 --> 00:58:48,905
and that's hard to explain,

1003
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:49,969
but when you live with them

1004
00:58:50,048 --> 00:58:52,482
like I did on the <i>Flipper</i> TV show
day and night,

1005
00:58:52,551 --> 00:58:55,452
I could read that body language.

1006
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,093
There's something visceral

1007
00:59:03,161 --> 00:59:06,597
about being in the water
with an animal like this.

1008
00:59:06,665 --> 00:59:08,064
As a scientist,

1009
00:59:08,133 --> 00:59:11,933
I'm trained to recognize intelligence
through objective measures...

1010
00:59:12,003 --> 00:59:13,800
tool use, cognitive processes,
and so on.

1011
00:59:13,872 --> 00:59:15,134
As a human being,

1012
00:59:15,207 --> 00:59:19,667
when I see a dolphin looking at me
and his eyes tracking me

1013
00:59:19,744 --> 00:59:22,269
and I lock eyes with that animal,

1014
00:59:22,347 --> 00:59:24,679
there's a human response
that makes it undeniable

1015
00:59:24,749 --> 00:59:27,309
that I'm connecting
with an intelligent being.

1016
00:59:29,654 --> 00:59:33,146
Science has been tantalized for years
at the prospect of talking

1017
00:59:33,225 --> 00:59:35,250
to the most intelligent
creatures on earth,

1018
00:59:35,327 --> 00:59:36,760
which may not be human beings.

1019
00:59:36,828 --> 00:59:38,227
A small group of scientists

1020
00:59:38,296 --> 00:59:40,628
determined to see
if humans and dolphins

1021
00:59:40,699 --> 00:59:42,257
can learn to talk to each other.

1022
00:59:42,334 --> 00:59:47,135
We keep spending billions of dollars
for sending signals up into the sky,

1023
00:59:47,205 --> 00:59:48,638
and we have a species here

1024
00:59:48,707 --> 00:59:52,473
that can conceivably be
more intelligent than we are.

1025
01:00:01,353 --> 01:00:04,413
Dolphins can understand
how to manipulate situations,

1026
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:05,854
how to relate to people,

1027
01:00:05,924 --> 01:00:10,520
how to create innovatively
out of their own imagination.

1028
01:00:10,595 --> 01:00:11,892
It sometimes amazes me

1029
01:00:11,963 --> 01:00:13,555
that the only language

1030
01:00:13,632 --> 01:00:15,793
which has been extensively
taught to dolphins

1031
01:00:15,867 --> 01:00:17,892
is a version of
American Sign Language,

1032
01:00:17,969 --> 01:00:19,368
which, of course,
you use your hands,

1033
01:00:19,437 --> 01:00:21,200
so you have
all these wonderful signals,

1034
01:00:21,273 --> 01:00:24,071
and people use their hands
to give messages to dolphins.

1035
01:00:25,644 --> 01:00:27,703
And this somehow
kind of misses the point

1036
01:00:27,779 --> 01:00:29,872
because dolphins don't have hands,

1037
01:00:29,948 --> 01:00:32,883
so this is inherently
a very one-way process.

1038
01:00:32,951 --> 01:00:34,680
And it's this anthropomorphic

1039
01:00:34,753 --> 01:00:37,586
"We have something
to teach them or control them,"

1040
01:00:37,656 --> 01:00:40,682
and perhaps we ought to be looking
at what they can give to us.

1041
01:00:43,395 --> 01:00:45,920
It's not about intelligence.

1042
01:00:45,997 --> 01:00:48,659
It's about consciousness.

1043
01:00:48,733 --> 01:00:53,170
They are self-aware,
like humans are self-aware.

1044
01:00:53,238 --> 01:00:55,069
That means that we look in the mirror,

1045
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:58,075
and we know exactly
what we're looking at.

1046
01:00:58,143 --> 01:01:02,239
I don't believe that the fishermen
here are aware of that.

1047
01:01:07,085 --> 01:01:08,677
When they're in that killing cove

1048
01:01:08,753 --> 01:01:11,881
and their babies are being
slaughtered in front of them,

1049
01:01:11,957 --> 01:01:13,549
they're aware of that.

1050
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:17,857
They can anticipate
what's going to happen to them.

1051
01:02:03,441 --> 01:02:07,810
The first time I went to Taiji
was in 1980,

1052
01:02:07,879 --> 01:02:11,246
and I had been to Iki the year before.

1053
01:02:11,316 --> 01:02:15,343
Iki is a tourist destination for Japanese

1054
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:17,354
which became infamous

1055
01:02:17,422 --> 01:02:21,153
for this... most ghastly
slaughters of dolphins.

1056
01:02:21,226 --> 01:02:24,855
I mean, literally thousands of them
would... could be killed in a day.

1057
01:02:28,933 --> 01:02:33,165
Well, I went back to Iki
about three years ago,

1058
01:02:33,238 --> 01:02:35,001
and they don't have any dolphins,

1059
01:02:35,073 --> 01:02:39,908
where once they had thousands of them
streaming by the coast.

1060
01:02:48,053 --> 01:02:49,816
Irony of ironies.

1061
01:02:49,888 --> 01:02:54,291
Because the international
captivity trade is so lucrative,

1062
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:56,418
they want to be in on it,

1063
01:02:56,494 --> 01:02:59,463
and they don't have any dolphins.

1064
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:03,394
They have to have dolphins
for their dolphin parks,

1065
01:03:03,468 --> 01:03:06,369
so they go buy them in Taiji now.

1066
01:03:08,907 --> 01:03:12,070
Every cetacean known to man
is endangered

1067
01:03:12,143 --> 01:03:14,202
just by going anywhere near Japan.

1068
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:22,753
We asked the Taiji fishermen
if we could subsidize this activity...

1069
01:03:22,821 --> 01:03:25,585
in other words, if you leave the boats
tied up at the dock,

1070
01:03:25,657 --> 01:03:27,625
we'll pay you the same amount of money

1071
01:03:27,692 --> 01:03:31,753
you would have made
killing dolphins in Taiji.

1072
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:35,095
They got back to us and said
"It's not about money.

1073
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:38,329
It's about pest control."

1074
01:03:38,403 --> 01:03:39,700
Pest control.

1075
01:03:39,771 --> 01:03:41,796
In other words,

1076
01:03:41,873 --> 01:03:44,364
they're being told by the government

1077
01:03:44,442 --> 01:03:49,277
that the dolphin are
eating too much fish in the ocean.

1078
01:03:57,455 --> 01:04:03,451
This is not attempt
just to incriminate whales as a bad guy.

1079
01:04:03,528 --> 01:04:09,228
However, we cannot ignore
the fishing effort has been decreasing.

1080
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:15,068
It's seriously hard to take that
PowerPoint demonstration seriously.

1081
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:19,304
I have to tell you
that there is very strong evidence

1082
01:04:19,377 --> 01:04:23,143
that whales are consuming
huge quantities of fish

1083
01:04:23,214 --> 01:04:26,115
that are also the target of fisheries.

1084
01:04:26,184 --> 01:04:28,482
The Government of Brazil
wants to put on record

1085
01:04:28,553 --> 01:04:30,487
that to us it certainly amounts

1086
01:04:30,555 --> 01:04:33,581
to what only can be described
as biological nonsense.

1087
01:04:33,658 --> 01:04:36,126
It is clear that the fisheries
of the world are on decline,

1088
01:04:36,194 --> 01:04:39,095
and the obvious culprit is people,

1089
01:04:39,164 --> 01:04:41,689
and we don't want to acknowledge that.

1090
01:04:50,475 --> 01:04:54,468
We look at the ocean
as a source of infinite quality seafood,

1091
01:04:54,546 --> 01:04:56,639
and I think we're learning
some hard lessons

1092
01:04:56,714 --> 01:04:57,976
that this isn't true.

1093
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:04,315
We're pulling the fish
out of the ocean at such a rate

1094
01:05:04,389 --> 01:05:07,153
and eroding and diminishing
our marine ecosystems

1095
01:05:07,225 --> 01:05:09,955
so bad that the whole
thing could collapse.

1096
01:05:23,508 --> 01:05:26,443
70% of human beings,
seven out of ten people,

1097
01:05:26,511 --> 01:05:29,241
rely as their principal
protein on seafood.

1098
01:05:30,982 --> 01:05:34,418
If we lose access to fish in the sea,

1099
01:05:34,486 --> 01:05:38,445
we will be causing
the biggest public health problem

1100
01:05:38,523 --> 01:05:40,991
human beings have ever faced.

1101
01:05:46,264 --> 01:05:50,462
The Japanese literally control
the world marketplace in fish.

1102
01:05:50,535 --> 01:05:54,471
They have buyers in every
major port in the world.

1103
01:05:54,539 --> 01:05:58,908
They're catching their fish
from an ever-depleting supply,

1104
01:05:58,977 --> 01:06:02,879
and I think they have a real fear
that they will run out of food.

1105
01:06:04,782 --> 01:06:09,014
What more logical thing could they do
than catch whales to replace them?

1106
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:15,585
International Whaling Commission
is essentially killing

1107
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:19,994
coastal small-type
whaling communities like Taiji.

1108
01:06:32,076 --> 01:06:37,275
This body should seriously consider
the proposal that is before us.

1109
01:06:37,348 --> 01:06:41,409
Dominica would like to compliment
the Japanese delegation.

1110
01:06:41,486 --> 01:06:43,010
We strongly support the proposal.

1111
01:06:43,087 --> 01:06:46,523
Antigua and Barbuda
supports this declaration in its entirety.

1112
01:06:46,591 --> 01:06:49,116
Do we have any concern, any sympathy

1113
01:06:49,193 --> 01:06:51,058
for the plight of the people of Japan?

1114
01:06:51,129 --> 01:06:53,962
This is an opportunity to help Japan.

1115
01:06:54,032 --> 01:06:57,229
We could help the Japanese cause
and the people of Taiji.

1116
01:06:57,302 --> 01:07:01,204
We therefore urge this IWC to grant...

1117
01:07:01,272 --> 01:07:04,298
...their basic request
for them to engage in whaling.

1118
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:08,277
And therefore, St. Kitts and Nevis
support this proposal.

1119
01:07:08,346 --> 01:07:09,608
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1120
01:07:09,681 --> 01:07:14,744
In my opinion, this has
been sufficient enough time

1121
01:07:14,819 --> 01:07:20,314
to allow for the replenishment
of species... of certain species...

1122
01:07:20,391 --> 01:07:21,585
which were in decline

1123
01:07:21,659 --> 01:07:23,991
and some others which were
nearing extinction.

1124
01:07:24,062 --> 01:07:28,294
There are several facets in the interests
out of Antigua in whaling.

1125
01:07:28,366 --> 01:07:29,663
First of all, the government

1126
01:07:29,734 --> 01:07:31,702
is presently interested
in the whaling commission

1127
01:07:31,769 --> 01:07:34,431
because the Japanese government's
paying them to be interested.

1128
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,040
The Japanese government
and their agencies

1129
01:07:38,109 --> 01:07:41,510
go to small bankrupt nations

1130
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:44,412
and offer them financial support,

1131
01:07:44,482 --> 01:07:45,972
offer them whatever it takes,

1132
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:48,678
firstly to get them to join the IWC

1133
01:07:48,753 --> 01:07:51,119
and then, when they get here,
to vote for Japan.

1134
01:07:51,189 --> 01:07:54,420
This is how whaling
in the 21st century works.

1135
01:07:54,492 --> 01:07:56,483
What kind of whales
pass through Antigua?

1136
01:07:56,561 --> 01:07:58,756
We have...

1137
01:07:58,830 --> 01:07:59,990
I think the Commissioner might be...

1138
01:08:00,064 --> 01:08:01,156
I think there's
some humpback whales...

1139
01:08:01,232 --> 01:08:02,256
- Yes.
...that pass through Antigua.

1140
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:03,527
I'm not sure of the details

1141
01:08:03,601 --> 01:08:04,795
of the whales that pass
through Antigua

1142
01:08:04,869 --> 01:08:06,769
at this point in time,
but there are whales

1143
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:08,465
that pass through our waters
from time to time.

1144
01:08:08,539 --> 01:08:09,938
I have seen only...

1145
01:08:10,008 --> 01:08:13,341
My only interaction with whales
are what I see on television.

1146
01:08:14,412 --> 01:08:19,714
It is so transparent to even the least
perspicacious onlooker

1147
01:08:19,784 --> 01:08:25,017
that they have prostituted themselves
for a few yen.

1148
01:08:27,425 --> 01:08:31,953
The Japanese government
pays our fees, our annual fees,

1149
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:35,193
for participation in the International
Whaling Commission.

1150
01:08:35,266 --> 01:08:37,496
It has nothing to do with nutrition.

1151
01:08:37,568 --> 01:08:40,128
It simply has to do with the fact
that "You voted for us,

1152
01:08:40,204 --> 01:08:42,638
"so let's give you something
that you people can see

1153
01:08:42,707 --> 01:08:45,073
"that it was worth your while
to sell your vote to us...

1154
01:08:45,143 --> 01:08:46,371
fisheries complexes."

1155
01:08:49,647 --> 01:08:53,310
Interestingly,
the fisheries complexes built by Japan

1156
01:08:53,384 --> 01:08:54,874
have already gone into disuse

1157
01:08:54,952 --> 01:08:58,547
because it has nothing to do with fishing.

1158
01:08:58,623 --> 01:09:00,386
One neighbor got the goodies,

1159
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:03,359
and every other neighbor
wants a part of the goodies.

1160
01:09:03,428 --> 01:09:05,692
Every island
in the Eastern Caribbean...

1161
01:09:05,763 --> 01:09:07,890
St. Kitts, Antigua,
St. Vincent., St. Lucia,

1162
01:09:07,965 --> 01:09:09,262
Grenada, Dominica...

1163
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:11,096
we all have the same goodies.

1164
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:15,865
In Dominica, we have a $22 million
fisheries complex

1165
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:19,740
which is used for the local merchants
to store imported chicken.

1166
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:26,546
It's very sad to see the beautiful
islands in the Caribbean

1167
01:09:26,617 --> 01:09:31,213
becoming neon-lit whorehouses
for the Japanese.

1168
01:09:32,523 --> 01:09:34,718
It really runs counter to logic

1169
01:09:34,792 --> 01:09:36,089
why the Japanese continue

1170
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,687
to keep this dying
whaling business going,

1171
01:09:39,764 --> 01:09:41,698
especially when you get the facts

1172
01:09:41,766 --> 01:09:43,199
about the levels of mercury

1173
01:09:43,267 --> 01:09:45,258
and other contaminants
in the meat.

1174
01:09:45,336 --> 01:09:47,804
I visited Japan earlier this year,

1175
01:09:47,872 --> 01:09:51,205
and I discovered that there
was another peculiar reason

1176
01:09:51,275 --> 01:09:53,709
for the Japanese position
at the IWC.

1177
01:09:53,778 --> 01:09:57,009
This has not got to do
with economics.

1178
01:09:57,081 --> 01:09:59,572
it hasn't even got to do with politics.

1179
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:02,346
It really has to do with the...

1180
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:06,720
the remnants
of a traditional notion of empire.

1181
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:09,351
They had had enough of the West

1182
01:10:09,427 --> 01:10:12,260
telling them what to do
and how to do it and when to do it.

1183
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:14,696
"Well, you're not going to make us
stop killing whales."

1184
01:10:15,933 --> 01:10:19,960
There's some kind of misplaced
nationalistic pride at work.

1185
01:10:20,037 --> 01:10:22,335
It's an industry that is
massively subsidized

1186
01:10:22,406 --> 01:10:23,634
by Japanese taxpayers,

1187
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:25,608
and when you have those sorts
of subsidies in place,

1188
01:10:25,676 --> 01:10:27,405
you invite corruption.

1189
01:10:27,478 --> 01:10:31,778
In order to perpetuate
this cultural argument,

1190
01:10:31,849 --> 01:10:33,783
the Taiji dolphin hunters

1191
01:10:33,851 --> 01:10:37,116
started giving
the dolphin meat away free

1192
01:10:37,188 --> 01:10:38,849
to the school system.

1193
01:10:38,923 --> 01:10:41,289
They're getting this
in a form of propaganda.

1194
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:42,690
They're not being told

1195
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,160
that the free lunchmeat
that their children are getting

1196
01:10:45,229 --> 01:10:48,494
are contaminated
with high levels of mercury.

1197
01:10:48,566 --> 01:10:50,966
Are you aware
of the Mayor of Taiji's plan

1198
01:10:51,035 --> 01:10:52,593
to distribute dolphin meat
throughout Japan

1199
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:54,160
to Japanese children?

1200
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:58,805
I think you...
correctly misunderstood.

1201
01:10:58,876 --> 01:10:59,968
Did I?

1202
01:11:00,044 --> 01:11:03,172
You perfectly misunderstood.

1203
01:11:16,127 --> 01:11:18,960
Two city council members
came out on record.

1204
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:20,657
They risked their...

1205
01:11:20,731 --> 01:11:23,222
if not their lives,
their livelihood to speak out.

1206
01:11:46,324 --> 01:11:48,121
There's a saying in Japan

1207
01:11:48,192 --> 01:11:51,719
that says the nail that sticks out
must be pounded down,

1208
01:11:51,796 --> 01:11:53,127
and so it's a real problem

1209
01:11:53,197 --> 01:11:56,257
just to stand up
and be counted in Japan.

1210
01:11:57,468 --> 01:12:01,734
There's no environmental movement
working actively on this issue

1211
01:12:01,806 --> 01:12:05,469
that has any kind
of power at all in that country.

1212
01:12:05,543 --> 01:12:07,807
We are dumping in the environment

1213
01:12:07,879 --> 01:12:12,179
all kinds of chemicals
like mercury, cadmium, lead.

1214
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,649
We have the obligation...

1215
01:12:13,718 --> 01:12:16,687
We have a moral authority
to do something about it.

1216
01:12:16,754 --> 01:12:17,846
In a few years,

1217
01:12:17,922 --> 01:12:19,719
we may look back
and wonder what we did,

1218
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:23,726
allowing more and more tons
of meat to be consumed.

1219
01:12:23,794 --> 01:12:25,557
We have a moral obligation,

1220
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:28,394
and let it not be said
that you didn't know about it.

1221
01:12:28,466 --> 01:12:29,728
You know about it.

1222
01:12:31,202 --> 01:12:35,468
To me, you're either an activist
or an inactivist,

1223
01:12:35,539 --> 01:12:37,234
and I wanted to be active.

1224
01:12:37,308 --> 01:12:39,242
I wanted to stop this.

1225
01:13:17,581 --> 01:13:19,105
I recognize it. Do you?

1226
01:13:19,183 --> 01:13:21,549
8335. Yeah, I do recognize it.

1227
01:13:21,619 --> 01:13:24,144
I think it was the double
channels. Yep.

1228
01:13:25,756 --> 01:13:27,314
Can you go straight?

1229
01:13:28,693 --> 01:13:30,456
They're doing a circle.

1230
01:13:30,528 --> 01:13:31,961
Let's take a quick break.

1231
01:13:32,029 --> 01:13:33,018
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

1232
01:13:33,097 --> 01:13:36,658
- It's 766. It's the cop.
- Is it?

1233
01:15:18,903 --> 01:15:20,928
Louie, Louie, are you there?

1234
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:10,915
Yeah, that's cool.

1235
01:16:20,498 --> 01:16:21,829
Set it down.

1236
01:20:56,707 --> 01:21:02,202
There was kind of a collective horror
when we started to see the footage.

1237
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:04,338
It was mind-boggling.

1238
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:09,142
They're doing it exactly

1239
01:21:09,219 --> 01:21:10,743
like they did with the large whales.

1240
01:21:10,821 --> 01:21:13,449
they're slaughtering
every one they can get.

1241
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:05,404
Why didn't they set them free?

1242
01:22:10,314 --> 01:22:14,614
That question has kept me
awake for a long time.

1243
01:22:23,994 --> 01:22:25,689
I've watched them give birth.

1244
01:22:25,762 --> 01:22:29,755
I've nursed them back to health
when they're sick.

1245
01:22:31,401 --> 01:22:33,835
Had I known what I know now,

1246
01:22:33,904 --> 01:22:35,337
I would have raised enough money

1247
01:22:35,405 --> 01:22:37,168
to buy them away
from the Seaquarium

1248
01:22:37,241 --> 01:22:38,435
and set them free.

1249
01:22:38,509 --> 01:22:41,000
That would have been
the right thing to do.

1250
01:22:41,078 --> 01:22:44,741
I was buying
a new Porsche every year.

1251
01:22:44,815 --> 01:22:50,515
But I was as ignorant as I could be
for as long as I could be.

1252
01:22:50,587 --> 01:22:54,387
I didn't think about that
for a long time later.

1253
01:23:00,864 --> 01:23:02,058
Listen to me.

1254
01:23:02,132 --> 01:23:05,329
Our killing method
has been improved substantially,

1255
01:23:05,402 --> 01:23:07,495
and the fishermen in Taiji

1256
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:09,766
are using specific-made knife

1257
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,105
and put the... do that...
to the spine,

1258
01:23:13,176 --> 01:23:16,043
and then most of the animals
are killed instantly.

1259
01:23:16,113 --> 01:23:18,240
- Killed instantly?
- Yes.

1260
01:23:18,315 --> 01:23:21,250
And if they were killed
other than this method,

1261
01:23:21,318 --> 01:23:22,683
would that be cruel?

1262
01:23:25,689 --> 01:23:28,886
As I told you, I don't want to talk
about "if" stories.

1263
01:23:28,959 --> 01:23:32,190
I want to show you
some video that I just saw.

1264
01:23:57,254 --> 01:23:59,722
When and where did you take this?

1265
01:25:29,846 --> 01:25:32,781
I have to see this end in my lifetime.

1266
01:25:35,052 --> 01:25:39,045
Right now I'm focusing
on that one little body of water

1267
01:25:39,122 --> 01:25:42,182
where that slaughter takes place.

1268
01:25:42,259 --> 01:25:45,956
If we can't stop that,
if we can't fix that,

1269
01:25:46,029 --> 01:25:48,691
forget about the bigger issues.

1270
01:25:50,233 --> 01:25:51,564
There's no hope.

1271

01:30:48,231 --> 01:30:51,758
Everyone there,
show us your passport.

1273
01:30:51,835 --> 01:30:53,860
Hey. How are you?

1274
01:30:53,937 --> 01:30:55,529
Nice to see you.

1275
01:31:08,485 --> 01:31:11,613
So we went for...
for the children, you see.
