1
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,840
- Mama!
- We know.

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,150
Jyn, gather your things. It's time.

3
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,790
- Hello?
- Saw, it's Lyra.

4
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,510
It's happened. He's come for us.

5
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,270
You know what to do.

6
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,870
Jyn, come here.

7
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,830
Remember, whatever I do,

8
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,990
I do it to protect you.

9
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,830
Say you understand.

10
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,310
I understand.

11
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,390
I love you, Stardust.

12
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,030
I love you, too, Papa.

13
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,470
Galen.

14
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,460
Go.

15
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,710
Jyn.

16
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,830
You know where to go, don't you?

17
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,270
Trust the Force.

18
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,710
You're a hard man to find, Galen.

19
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,150
But farming...

20
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,990
Really? Man of your talents?

21
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,590
It's a peaceful life.

22
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,190
It's lonely, I imagine.

23
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,920
Since Lyra died, yes.

24
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,150
My condolences.

25
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,350
Search the house.

26
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,310
What is it you want?

27
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,470
The work has stalled. I need you to come back.

28
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,990
I won't do it, Krennic.

29
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,640
We were on the verge of greatness.

30
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,390
We were this close

31
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,750
to providing peace and security for the galaxy.

32
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,110
You're confusing peace with terror.

33
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,270
Well,

34
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,910
you have to start somewhere.

35
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,950
I'd be of no help, Krennic.

36
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,790
My mind just isn't what it was.

37
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,550
I have trouble remembering.

38
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,990
Even simple things.

39
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,830
Galen...

40
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,470
You're an inspired scientist, but you're a terrible liar.

41
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,840
Now, I admire the effort. I really do.

42
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,790
Oh, look, here's Lyra, back from the dead.

43
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,780
It's a miracle.

44
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,030
Stop!

45
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,870
Oh, Lyra,

46
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,840
troublesome as ever.

47
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,790
You're not taking him.

48
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,030
No, of course I'm not. I'm taking you all.

49
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,400
You'll all come. You, your child. You'll all live in comfort.

50
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,350
As hostages.

51
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,950
As heroes of the Empire.

52
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,990
Lyra.

53
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,030
Put it down.

54
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,670
Think very carefully.

55
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,830
- You will never win.
- Do it.

56
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,870
Lyra!

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,630
Lyra!

58
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,270
They have a child!

59
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,230
Find it!

60
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,150
My child!

61
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,940
Come.

62
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,150
Come.

63
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,670
We have a long ride ahead of us.

64
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,040
Check in security,

65
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,430
cell block 4227.

66
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,590
4227.

67
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,270
I was about to leave.

68
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,790
I came as fast as I could.

69
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,870
I have to get back on board. Walk with me.

70
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,910
Back to Jedha?

71
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,110
They'll leave without me.

72
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,150
Easy! You have news from Jedha.

73
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,720
Come on.

74
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,990
An Imperial pilot, one of the cargo drivers

75
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,350
he defected yesterday.

76
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,150
He's telling people they're making a weapon.

77
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,110
The kyber crystals, that's what they're for.

78
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,190
What kind of weapon?

79
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,740
Look, I have to go.

80
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,860
What kind of weapon?

81
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,000
A planet killer!

82
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,680
That's what he called it!

83
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,050
A planet killer?

84
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,460
Someone named Erso sent him.

85
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,790
Some old friend of Saw's.

86
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,790
Galen Erso? Was it?

87
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,350
I don't know! They were looking for Saw when we left.

88
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,050
Who else knows about this?

89
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,790
I have no idea.

90
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,230
It's all falling apart.

91
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,670
Saw's right.

92
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,110
There's spies everywhere.

93
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,590
What's all this?

94
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,670
Come on, let's see some scandocs.

95
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,560
Yeah, of course. Just... My gloves.

96
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,790
No!

97
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,710
What have you done?

98
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,670
Troopers down. Section 9.

99
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,030
Are you crazy?

100
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,990
I'll never climb out of here. My arm!

101
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,270
Get out of the way.

102
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,350
Move! Move!

103
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,070
Hey. Calm down. Calm down.

104
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,790
It will be all right.

105
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,750
Is that him?

106
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,430
He looks kind of different to how I imagined.

107
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,550
Okay. So you're Saw Gerrera?

108
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,670
Saw Gerrera?

109
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,550
No?

110
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,070
Okay, we're just wasting time that we don't have.

111
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,070
I need to speak to Saw Gerrera. I keep telling them.

112
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,830
Before it's too late.

113
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,550
We're out here in the middle of nowhere.

114
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,390
We need to get to Jedha City.

115
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,790
What part of "urgent message" do you guys not understand?

116
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,280
We are all on the same side.

117
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,950
If you just see past the uniform for a minute.

118
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,990
What now?

119
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,360
I don't know. Must be another pickup.

120
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,960
I thought we had everybody.

121
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,270
All clear, sir.

122
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,270
Hallik! Liana Hallik!

123
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,350
Her.

124
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,310
You wanna get out of here?

125
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,430
Hey! What about me?

126
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,070
Give me the keys! Give me the keys!

127
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,830
Congratulations. You are being rescued.

128
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,510
Please do not resist.

129
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,670
LU-28, report to maintenance level 4.

130
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,710
You're currently calling yourself Liana Hallik.

131
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,870
Is that correct?

132
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,710
Possession of unsanctioned weapons.

133
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,870
Forgery of Imperial documents.

134
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,550
Aggravated assault. Escape from custody.

135
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,200
Resisting arrest.

136
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,310
Imagine if the Imperial authorities had found out...

137
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,350
who you really were, Jyn Erso.

138
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,310
That is your given name, is it not?

139
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,590
Jyn Erso, daughter of Galen Erso?

140
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,830
A known Imperial collaborator in weapons development.

141
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,030
What is this?

142
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,030
It's a chance for you to make a fresh start.

143
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,990
We think you might be able to help us.

144
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,350
This is Captain Cassian Andor, Rebel Intelligence.

145
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,590
When was the last time you were in contact with your father?

146
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,900
15 years ago.

147
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,020
Any idea where he's been all that time?

148
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,390
I like to think he's dead.

149
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,960
Makes things easier.

150
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Easier than what?

151
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,270
That he's been a tool of the Imperial war machine?

152
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,150
I've never had the luxury of political opinions.

153
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,150
Really?

154
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,630
When was your last contact with Saw Gerrera?

155
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,620
It's been a long time.

156
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,560
But he'll remember you, though.

157
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,630
Wouldn't he?

158
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,910
He might agree to meet you, if you came as a friend.

159
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,070
We're up against the clock here, girl, so if there's nothing to talk about,

160
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,560
we'll just put you back where we found you.

161
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,990
I was a child. Saw Gerrera saved my life. He raised me.

162
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,150
But I have no idea where he is.

163
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,310
I haven't seen him in years.

164
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,830
We know how to find him.

165
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,140
That's not our problem.

166
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,390
What we need is someone

167
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,270
who gets us through the door without being killed.

168
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,150
You're all rebels, aren't you?

169
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,150
Yes, but Saw Gerrera is an extremist.

170
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,830
He's been fighting on his own since he broke with the Rebellion.

171
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,590
His militancy has caused the Alliance

172
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,790
a great many problems.

173
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,270
We have no choice now but to try

174
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,760
and mend that broken trust.

175
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,830
What does this have to do with my father?

176
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,510
There's an Imperial defector in Jedha. A pilot.

177
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,350
He's been held by Saw Gerrera.

178
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,430
He's claiming the Emperor is creating a weapon

179
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,710
with the power to destroy entire planets.

180
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,180
The pilot says he was sent by your father.

181
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,550
We need to stop this weapon before it is finished.

182
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,550
Captain Andor's mission is to authenticate the pilot's story.

183
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,200
And then, if possible, find your father.

184
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,630
It appears he is critical to the development of this super weapon.

185
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,750
Given the gravity of the situation

186
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,670
and your history with Saw,

187
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,830
we're hoping that he will help us locate your father

188
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,640
and return him to the Senate for testimony.

189
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,070
And if I do it?

190
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,400
We'll make sure you go free.

191
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,910
Captain Andor.

192
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,990
I'm K-2SO.

193
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,920
I'm a reprogrammed Imperial droid.

194
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,430
I remember you.

195
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,950
I see the Council is sending you with us to Jedha.

196
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,790
Apparently so.

197
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,290
That is a bad idea.

198
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,110
I think so, and so does Cassian.

199
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,510
What do I know?

200
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,440
My specialty is just strategic analysis.

201
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,060
Galen Erso is vital to the Empire's weapons program.

202
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,430
Forget what you heard in there.

203
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,350
There will be no extraction.

204
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,670
You find him...

205
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,590
you kill him.

206
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,550
Then and there.

207
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,990
Shuttle number LMTR-20.

208
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,710
Prepare for takeoff while we check your authorization.

209
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,230
You met K-2?

210
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,470
Charming.

211
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,790
He tends to say whatever comes into his circuits.

212
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,110
It's a byproduct of the reprogram.

213
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,790
Why does she get a blaster and I don't?

214
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,830
- What?
- I know how to use it.

215
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,670
That's what I'm afraid of. Give it to me.

216
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,630
We're going to Jedha.

217
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,200
That's a war zone.

218
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,820
That's not the point. Where'd you get it?

219
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,430
I found it.

220
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,510
I find that answer vague and unconvincing.

221
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,670
Trust goes both ways.

222
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,230
You're letting her keep it?

223
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,910
Would you like to know the probability

224
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,110
of her using it against you?

225
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,920
It's high.

226
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,510
Let's get going.

227
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,080
It's very high.

228
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,230
Lies!

229
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,680
Deceptions!

230
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,870
Let's see it.

231
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,190
"Bodhi Rook. Cargo pilot."

232
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,110
- Local boy, huh?
- Uh-huh.

233
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,510
Okay. I can hear you.

234
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,430
He didn't capture me. I came here myself. I defected.

235
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,470
I defected.

236
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,990
Every day, more lies.

237
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,950
Lies? Would I risk everything for a lie?

238
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,260
No, we don't have time for this.

239
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,830
I have to speak to Saw Gerrera before it's too late.

240
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,550
Okay.

241
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,630
Sorry, you're...

242
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,790
Um...

243
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,950
That's for you.

244
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,430
And I gave it to them.

245
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,310
They did not find it!

246
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,670
I gave it to them.

247
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,400
Uh, Galen Erso.

248
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,830
He told me to find you.

249
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,990
Bor Gullet.

250
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,350
Uh, Bor Gullet?

251
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,390
What? Wait!

252
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,550
Galen Erso sent me!

253
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,590
He told me to find you.

254
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,320
Most unfortunate about

255
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,750
the security breach on Jedha, Director Krennic.

256
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,510
After so many setbacks and delays, and now this.

257
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,230
We've heard word of rumors circulating through the city.

258
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,070
Apparently, you've lost

259
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,390
a rather talkative cargo pilot.

260
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,390
If the Senate gets wind of our project,

261
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,710
countless systems will flock to the Rebellion.

262
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,390
When the battle station is finished, Governor Tarkin...

263
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,750
the Senate will be of little concern.

264
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,510
When has become now, Director Krennic.

265
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,240
The Emperor will tolerate no further delay.

266
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,350
You have made time an ally of the Rebellion.

267
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,710
I suggest we solve both problems simultaneously...

268
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,790
with an immediate test of the weapon.

269
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,870
Failure will find you explaining why

270
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,950
to a far less patient audience.

271
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,150
I will not fail.

272
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,630
What's the matter, Jyn? You look frightened.

273
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,150
I'll always protect you.

274
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,960
Stardust.

275
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,470
Don't ever change.

276
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,710
Trust.

277
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,030
Galen.

278
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,990
We're coming into orbit. You have controls.

279
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,110
That's Jedha.

280
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,350
Or what's left of it.

281
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,350
We find Saw, we find your father.

282
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,230
What's with the Destroyer?

283
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,070
It's because of your old friend, Saw Gerrera.

284
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,740
He's been attacking the cargo shipments.

285
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,910
What are they bringing in?

286
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,480
It's what are they taking out.

287
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,520
Kyber crystal. All they can get.

288
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,430
We wondered why they were stripping the temple.

289
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,550
Now we know.

290
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,150
It's the fuel for the weapon.

291
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,960
The weapon your father's building.

292
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,190
Maybe we should leave target practice behind.

293
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,110
Are you talking about me?

294
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,000
She's right. We need to blend in.

295
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,300
Stay with the ship.

296
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,470
I can blend in. I'm an Imperial droid.

297
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,790
The city is under Imperial occupation.

298
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,470
Half the people here wanna reprogram you.

299
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,310
The other half wanna put a hole in your head.

300
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,790
I'm surprised you're so concerned with my safety.

301
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,830
I'm not.

302
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,710
I'm just worried they might miss you and hit me.

303
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,390
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

304
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,580
Bor Gullet

305
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,380
can feel

306
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,560
your thoughts.

307
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,950
No lie is safe.

308
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,710
What have you really brought me, cargo pilot?

309
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,030
Bor Gullet will know the truth.

310
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,230
The unfortunate side effect is that one tends...

311
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,630
to lose one's mind.

312
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,350
No!

313
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,390
Hey.

314
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,390
You just watch yourself.

315
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,510
Wait. No, no.

316
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,550
Sorry, sir.

317
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,390
We don't want any trouble. Sorry.

318
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,510
Come on. Come on.

319
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,630
Citizens of Jedha.

320
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,590
You must come forward with information

321
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,790
of the location of this missing cargo pilot.

322
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,870
A reward of 600 credits for the information shall be awarded.

323
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,830
I had a contact.

324
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,990
One of Saw's Rebels.

325
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,190
But he's just gone missing.

326
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,670
His sister will be looking for him.

327
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,310
The temple's been destroyed, but she'll be there waiting.

328
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,510
We'll give her your name

329
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,790
and hope that gets us a meeting with Saw.

330
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,030
Hope?

331
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,910
Yeah. Rebellions are built on hope.

332
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,790
Hands where I can see them.

333
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,990
Get over there.

334
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,510
Show me some identification. Check inside.

335
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,070
Is this all because of your pilot?

336
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,550
May the Force of others be with you.

337
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,950
Wait for me.

338
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,870
May the Force of others be with you.

339
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,630
May the Force of others be with you.

340
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,830
Would you trade that necklace for a glimpse into your future?

341
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,950
Yes.

342
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,150
I'm speaking to you.

343
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,990
I'm Chirrut Imwe.

344
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,990
How did you know I was wearing a necklace?

345
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,190
For that answer, you must pay.

346
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,350
What do you know about kyber crystals?

347
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,040
My father, he...

348
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,140
He said they powered the Jedi's lightsabers.

349
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,870
Jyn.

350
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,260
Come on. Let's go.

351
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,550
The strongest stars have hearts of kyber.

352
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,390
Let's go.

353
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,550
We're not here to make friends.

354
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,590
Who are they?

355
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,510
The Guardians of the Whills.

356
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,190
Protectors of the Kyber Temple.

357
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,230
But there's nothing left to protect.

358
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,910
So now they're just causing trouble for everybody.

359
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,630
You seem awfully tense all of a sudden.

360
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,680
We have to hurry. This town is ready to blow.

361
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,710
Citizens of the Empire...

362
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,540
Imperial forces tirelessly fight

363
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,550
Saw Gerrera's reign of terror...

364
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,360
over the people of this beloved city.

365
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,910
Truth and justice are the tools of the Empire.

366
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,470
Tell me you have a backup plan.

367
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,870
Incoming!

368
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,750
Looks like we found Saw's rebels.

369
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,630
Up there!

370
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,430
Jyn, no!

371
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,590
Hit the terrorist.

372
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,350
Get out of there!

373
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,030
Kyber...

374
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,470
Come on!

375
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,510
This way!

376
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,220
Cassian!

377
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,790
Did you know that wasn't me?

378
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,230
Yeah. Of course.

379
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,310
I thought I told you to stay on the ship.

380
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,310
You did. But I thought it was boring,

381
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,390
and you were in trouble.

382
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,710
There were a lot of explosions...

383
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,470
- for two people blending in.
- Freeze!

384
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,430
You're right.

385
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,230
I should just wait on the ship.

386
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,910
Halt. Stop right there.

387
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,040
Where are you taking these prisoners?

388
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,630
These are prisoners.

389
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,910
Yes. Where are you taking them?

390
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,710
I am taking them to imprison them in prison.

391
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,470
- He's taking us to...
- Quiet!

392
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,590
And there's a fresh one if you mouth off again.

393
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,030
- We'll take them from here.
- That's okay.

394
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,340
If you could just point me in the right direction,

395
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,350
I can take them, I'm sure.

396
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,470
- I've taken them this far.
- Hey, wait a second.

397
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,630
- Take them away.
- Wait.

398
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,190
You can't take them away.

399
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,790
You. Stay here.

400
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,150
We need to check your diagnostics.

401
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,710
Diagnostics?

402
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,710
I'm capable of running my own diagnostics,

403
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,790
thank you very much.

404
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,590
Let them pass in peace.

405
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,110
Let them pass in peace.

406
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,790
The Force is with me.

407
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,310
And I am with the Force.

408
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,630
And I fear nothing.

409
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,360
For all is as the Force wills it.

410
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,430
Hey, stop right there.

411
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,630
He's blind.

412
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,200
Is he deaf?

413
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,550
I said stop right there!

414
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,400
Is your foot all right?

415
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,520
You almost shot me.

416
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,350
You're welcome.

417
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,120
Clear of hostiles.

418
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,110
- One hostile.
- He's with us.

419
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,990
They're all right.

420
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,540
Thanks.

421
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,460
Cassian, I'm sorry about the slap.

422
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,510
Go back to the ship. Wait for my call.

423
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,430
Is he a Jedi?

424
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,550
There are no Jedi here anymore.

425
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,230
Only dreamers like this fool.

426
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,230
The Force did protect me.

427
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,830
I protected you.

428
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,990
Can you get us to Saw Gerrera?

429
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,070
Can't you see? We are no friends of the Empire.

430
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,470
Anyone who kills me or my friends

431
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,390
will answer to Saw Gerrera.

432
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,150
Because I'm the daughter of Galen Erso.

433
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,110
Are you kidding me? I'm blind.

434
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,310
I'm one with the Force, the Force is with me.

435
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,590
I'm one with the Force, the Force is with me.

436
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,390
You pray?

437
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,830
I'm one with the Force, the Force is with me.

438
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,950
Really?

439
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,600
I'm one with the Force, the Force is with me.

440
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,110
He's praying for the door to open.

441
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,190
It bothers him because he knows it's possible.

442
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,590
Baze Malbus was once the most devoted Guardian of us all.

443
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,550
I'm beginning to think the Force and I have different priorities.

444
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,120
Relax, Captain.

445
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,750
We've been in worse cages than this one.

446
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,790
This is the first for me.

447
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,910
There is more than one sort of prison, Captain.

448
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,390
I sense that you carry yours wherever you go.

449
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,270
Jyn.

450
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,430
Is it really you?

451
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,430
I can't believe it!

452
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,310
Must be quite a surprise.

453
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,590
Are we not still friends?

454
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,350
The last time I saw you,

455
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,590
you gave me a knife and loaded blaster...

456
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,360
and told me to wait in a bunker till daylight.

457
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,310
I knew you were safe.

458
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,310
You left me behind.

459
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,790
You were already the best soldier in my cadre.

460
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,830
- I was 16!
- I was protecting you!

461
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,950
You dumped me!

462
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,190
You were the daughter of an Imperial science officer.

463
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,430
People were starting to figure that out.

464
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,390
People who wanted to use you as a hostage.

465
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,470
Not a day goes by...

466
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,230
that I don't think of you.

467
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,070
But today...

468
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,630
of all days...

469
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,990
It's a trap.

470
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,470
Isn't it?

471
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,030
What?

472
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,470
The pilot.

473
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,990
The message.

474
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,150
All of it.

475
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,830
Did they send you?

476
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,790
Did you come here...

477
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,350
to kill me?

478
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,870
There's not much of me left.

479
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,350
The Alliance wants my father.

480
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,350
They think he sent you a message about a weapon.

481
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,360
I guess they think by sending me,

482
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,150
you might actually help them out.

483
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,030
So what is it that you want, Jyn?

484
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,190
They wanted an introduction, they've got it.

485
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,620
I'm out now.

486
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,630
Rest of you can do what you want.

487
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,390
You care not about the cause?

488
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,230
The cause?

489
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,950
Seriously?

490
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,470
The Alliance...

491
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,150
the rebels, whatever it is

492
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,560
you're calling yourself these days...

493
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,910
all it's ever brought me is pain.

494
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,710
You can stand to see the Imperial flag

495
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,790
reign across the galaxy?

496
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,750
It's not a problem if you don't look up.

497
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,030
I have something to show you.

498
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,310
Come.

499
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,510
The Emperor is awaiting my report.

500
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,350
One would hope that he and Lord Vader

501
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,790
might've been here for such an occasion.

502
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,270
And I thought it prudent to save you

503
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,580
from any potential embarrassment.

504
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,950
Your concern's hardly warranted.

505
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,350
If saying it would only make it so.

506
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,360
All Imperial forces have been evacuated...

507
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,630
and I stand ready to destroy the entire moon.

508
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,950
That won't be necessary.

509
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,070
We need a statement, not a manifesto.

510
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,840
The Holy City will be enough for today.

511
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,070
Target Jedha City.

512
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,150
Prepare single reactor ignition.

513
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,770
Sir, we're in position...

514
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:21,470
Fire!

515
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,150
Commence primary ignition.

516
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,230
Who's the one in the next cell?

517
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,030
What?

518
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,150
Where?

519
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,750
An Imperial pilot.

520
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,950
- Pilot?
- I'm gonna kill him!

521
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,030
- No, no. No, wait!
- Come here!

522
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,790
No!

523
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,670
Back off! Back off!

524
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,990
Okay, okay.

525
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,550
Are you the pilot?

526
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,880
Hey. Hey.

527
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:59,030
Are you the pilot? The shuttle pilot?

528
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,510
Pilot?

529
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,190
What's wrong with him?

530
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,350
Galen Erso.

531
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,560
You know that name?

532
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,990
I brought the message. I'm the pilot.

533
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,950
I'm the pilot.

534
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,350
I'm the pilot.

535
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,190
Okay. Good.

536
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,750
Now where is Galen Erso?

537
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,190
Stand by.

538
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,710
This is the message I was sent.

539
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,110
Saw, if you are watching this...

540
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,390
then perhaps there's a chance to save the Alliance.

541
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,670
Perhaps there's a chance to explain myself...

542
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,910
and, though I don't dare hope for too much...

543
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,540
a chance for Jyn, if she's alive...

544
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,670
if you can possibly find her...

545
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,590
to let her know that my love for her has never faded...

546
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,230
and how desperately I've missed her.

547
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,150
Jyn, my Stardust...

548
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,150
I can't imagine what you think of me.

549
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,070
When I was taken, I faced some bitter truths.

550
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,030
I was told that soon enough

551
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,870
Krennic would have you as well.

552
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,150
As time went by...

553
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,270
I knew that you were either dead...

554
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,750
or so well hidden that he would never find you.

555
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,270
I knew if I had refused to work, if I took my own life...

556
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,590
it would only be a matter of time before Krennic realized...

557
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,110
he no longer needed me to complete the project.

558
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,710
So I did the one thing nobody expected.

559
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,870
I lied.

560
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,430
I learned to lie.

561
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,750
I played the part of a beaten man

562
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,670
resigned to the sanctuary of his work.

563
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,630
I made myself indispensable...

564
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,870
and all the while, I laid the groundwork of my revenge.

565
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,430
We call it the Death Star.

566
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,000
There is no better name...

567
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,590
and the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed.

568
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,510
I've placed a weakness deep within the system...

569
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,230
a flaw so small and powerful, they will never find it.

570
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,470
But, Jyn...

571
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,350
Jyn, if you're listening, my beloved...

572
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,240
so much of my life has been wasted.

573
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,270
I try to think of you only in the moments when I'm strong...

574
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,110
because the pain of not having you with me...

575
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,230
your mother, our family.

576
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,430
The pain of that loss is so overwhelming...

577
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,630
I risk failing even now.

578
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,230
It's just so hard not to think of you.

579
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,990
Think of where you are...

580
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,950
my Stardust.

581
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,350
Saw...

582
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,670
the reactor module, that's the key.

583
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,670
That's the place I've laid my trap.

584
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,070
It's well hidden and unstable.

585
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,320
One blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station.

586
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,350
You'll need the plans...

587
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,240
the structural plans for the Death Star, to find the reactor.

588
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,870
I know there's a complete engineering archive...

589
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,110
in the data vault at the Citadel Tower on Scarif.

590
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,710
Any pressurized explosion to the reactor module...

591
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,430
will set off a chain reaction that will destroy the entire station.

592
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,670
Go, go!

593
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,990
K-2, K-2! Where are you?

594
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,510
There you are.

595
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,630
I'm standing by as you requested...

596
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,990
although there's a problem on the horizon.

597
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,150
There's no horizon.

598
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,990
Locate our position. Bring that ship in here, now!

599
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,380
Where are you going?

600
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,040
I gotta find Jyn.

601
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,790
Get the pilot, we need him!

602
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,230
All right.

603
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,920
I'll get the pilot.

604
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,590
Pilot.

605
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:15,990
No, no, no!

606
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,260
Let's go.

607
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,430
Jyn!

608
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,230
Jyn!

609
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,630
Hey.

610
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,910
We gotta go.

611
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,990
I know where your father is.

612
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,150
Go with him, Jyn.

613
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,310
You must go!

614
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,350
Come with us.

615
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,230
I will run no longer.

616
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,590
- Come on.
- But you must save yourself.

617
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,270
- Come on.
- Go!

618
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,470
There's no time!

619
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,870
Save the Rebellion!

620
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,430
Save the dream.

621
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,670
Oh, it's beautiful.

622
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,350
Chirrut, let's go!

623
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,510
Come on!

624
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,430
Let's get out of here!

625
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,110
Get us out of here!

626
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,350
Punch it!

627
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,190
I'm not very optimistic about our odds.

628
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,350
Not now, K.

629
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,350
Come on!

630
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,230
Punch it.

631
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,430
I haven't completed my calculations.

632
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,670
I'll make them for you.

633
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,870
I believe I owe you an apology, Director Krennic.

634
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,030
Your work exceeds all expectations.

635
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,990
And you'll tell the Emperor as much?

636
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,270
I will tell him that his patience with your misadventures...

637
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,840
has been rewarded with a weapon

638
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,350
that will bring a swift end to the Rebellion.

639
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,550
And that that was only an inkling

640
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,350
of its destructive potential.

641
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,950
I will tell him that I will be taking control over the weapon...

642
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,670
I first spoke of years ago effective immediately.

643
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,870
We stand here amidst my achievement.

644
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,560
Not yours!

645
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,430
I'm afraid the recent security breaches...

646
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,030
have laid bare your inadequacies as a military director.

647
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,350
The breaches have been filled.

648
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,150
Jedha has been silenced.

649
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,990
You think this pilot acted alone?

650
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,630
He was dispatched from the installation on Eadu...

651
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,910
Galen Erso's facility.

652
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,070
Oh, we'll see about this.

653
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,390
A coded message from Captain Andor, sir.

654
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,630
"Weapon confirmed."

655
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,630
"Jedha destroyed."

656
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,470
"Mission target located on Eadu, please advise."

657
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,470
Destroyed?

658
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,630
Proceed.

659
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,190
Tell him my orders still stand.

660
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,350
Tell him to proceed with haste...

661
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,960
and keep to the plan.

662
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,590
We have no idea what he's building for the Empire.

663
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,110
We have to kill Galen Erso while we have the chance.

664
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,510
Baze, tell me.

665
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,670
All of it?

666
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,150
The whole city?

667
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,950
Tell me.

668
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,230
All of it.

669
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,070
Understood.

670
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,910
Set course for Eadu.

671
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,430
Setting course for Eadu.

672
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,470
Is that where my father is?

673
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,630
I think so.

674
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,790
So you're Galen's daughter?

675
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,270
You know him?

676
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,110
I am Bodhi, the pilot.

677
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,430
You brought the message.

678
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,550
Yes.

679
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,910
Your father...

680
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,760
he said I could get right by myself.

681
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,950
He said I could make it right...

682
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,990
if I was brave enough...

683
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,590
to listen to what was in my heart.

684
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,430
Do something about it.

685
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,510
Guess it was too late.

686
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,430
It wasn't too late.

687
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,910
Seems pretty late to me.

688
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,510
No.

689
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,430
We can beat the people who did this.

690
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,430
My father's message, I've seen it.

691
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,670
They call it the Death Star.

692
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,310
But they have no idea...

693
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,150
there's a way to defeat it.

694
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,540
You're wrong about my father.

695
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,750
He did build it.

696
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,790
Because he knew they'd do it without him.

697
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,920
My father made a choice.

698
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,430
He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion.

699
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,000
He's rigged a trap inside it.

700
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,470
That's why he sent you, to bring that message.

701
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,590
Where is it?

702
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,720
Where's the message?

703
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,150
It was a hologram.

704
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,670
You have that message, right?

705
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,990
Everything happened so fast.

706
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,830
Did you see it?

707
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,990
You don't believe me?

708
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,340
I'm not the one you've got to convince.

709
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,670
I believe her.

710
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,710
That's good to know.

711
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,070
What kind of trap?

712
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,870
You said your father made a trap.

713
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,150
The reactor. He's placed a weakness there.

714
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,230
He's been hiding it for years.

715
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,390
He said if you can blow the reactor,

716
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,350
the module, the whole system goes down.

717
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,030
You need to send word to the Alliance.

718
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:33,950
I've done that.

719
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,070
They have to know there's a way to destroy this thing.

720
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,030
They have to go to Scarif to get the plans.

721
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,790
I can't risk sending that.

722
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,790
We're in the heart of Imperial territory.

723
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,750
Then we'll find him and bring him back.

724
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,110
And he can tell them himself.

725
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,230
Course set for Eadu, sir.

726
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,260
I'm one with the Force, the Force is with me.

727
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,350
20 degrees to the right.

728
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,590
10 degrees up.

729
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,910
Lower, lower, lower. Lower!

730
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,790
Are you sure this is the way?

731
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,150
They have landing trackers here.

732
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,350
They have patrol squadrons.

733
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,750
You've got to stay in the canyon. Keep it low.

734
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,750
Watch your right!

735
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,030
There's a 26% chance of failure.

736
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,110
How much farther?

737
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,150
I don't know, I'm not sure. I never really come this way.

738
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,470
But we're close, we're close. I know that.

739
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,900
Now, there's a 35% chance of failure.

740
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,110
I don't wanna know. Thank you!

741
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,230
I understand.

742
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,940
Now! Put it down, now!

743
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,230
The wind.

744
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,070
If you keep going, you'll be right over the shuttle depot.

745
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,950
- Watch out!
- K!

746
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,390
Hold on tight!

747
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,920
We're coming down hard!

748
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,190
Try them again.

749
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,310
I am, sir. We...

750
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,070
The signal's gone dead.

751
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,910
Squadron up.

752
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,920
Target Eadu.

753
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,160
How about now? Check stabilizers.

754
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,080
Bodhi, where's the lab?

755
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,190
The research facility?

756
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,310
Yeah. Where is it?

757
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,110
It's just over that ridge.

758
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,510
That's a shuttle depot straight ahead of us.

759
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,350
- You are sure of that?
- Yes.

760
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,740
We'll have to hope

761
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,430
there's still an Imperial ship left to steal.

762
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,520
Here's what we're doing.

763
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,550
Hopefully the storm keeps up and keeps us hidden down here.

764
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,590
Bodhi, you're coming with me.

765
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,230
We'll go up the ridge and check it out.

766
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,590
I'm coming with you.

767
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,390
No, your father's message.

768
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,710
We can't risk it. You're the messenger.

769
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,360
That's ridiculous, we all got the message.

770
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,590
Everyone here knows it.

771
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,150
"One blast to the reactor module

772
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,990
"and the whole system goes down."

773
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,800
That's how you said it, "The whole system goes down."

774
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,950
Get to work fixing our comms.

775
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,910
All I want to do right now is get a handle on what we're up against.

776
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,910
So we're gonna go very small and very careful up the rise...

777
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:41,950
and see what's what.

778
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,070
Let's get outta here.

779
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,870
Does he look like a killer?

780
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,990
No. He has the face of a friend.

781
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,920
Who are you talking about?

782
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,510
Captain Andor.

783
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,710
Why'd you ask that?

784
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,150
What do you mean, "Does he look like a killer?"

785
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,240
The Force moves darkly

786
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,230
near a creature that's about to kill.

787
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,430
His weapon was in the sniper configuration.

788
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,070
No, no, no. We've got to go up.

789
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,750
You can't see much from down there.

790
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,710
This way.

791
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,510
I'll be right behind you.

792
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,510
Come on.

793
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,910
Where are you going?

794
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,990
I'm gonna follow Jyn.

795
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,070
Her path is clear.

796
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,830
Alone?

797
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,310
Good luck!

798
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,510
I don't need luck. I have you!

799
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,110
What are they doing?

800
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,190
If Cassian comes back, we're leaving without them.

801
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,710
You see Erso out there?

802
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,630
We've come too far.

803
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,630
Patience, my friend.

804
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,990
That's him.

805
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,830
That's him. Galen, in the dark suit.

806
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,310
Get back down there and find us a ride outta here.

807
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,560
Well, what are you doing?

808
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,590
You heard me.

809
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,310
You said we came up here just to have a look.

810
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,630
I'm here, I'm looking. Go.

811
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,990
Hurry!

812
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,270
Excellent news, Galen.

813
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,000
The battle station is complete.

814
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,950
You must be very proud.

815
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,470
Proud as I can be, Krennic.

816
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,710
Gather your engineers. I have an announcement.

817
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,110
Is that all of them?

818
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,630
Yes.

819
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,190
Gentlemen, one of you...

820
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,550
betrayed the Empire.

821
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,270
One of you has conspired with a pilot...

822
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,390
to send messages to the Rebellion.

823
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,470
And I urge that traitor...

824
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,950
step forward.

825
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,830
Very well...

826
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,950
I'll consider it a group effort then.

827
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,350
Ready!

828
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,950
- No! No!
- Aim!

829
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,910
And fire!

830
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,550
Stop! Stop! Stop!

831
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,630
Krennic, stop!

832
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,970
It was me!

833
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,870
It was me!

834
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,870
They have nothing to do with it.

835
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,390
Spare them.

836
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,350
Fire!

837
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,220
How do I know the weapon is complete?

838
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,910
Let me share with you some details.

839
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,030
Cassian.

840
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,320
Cassian, can you hear me?

841
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,840
I'm here. You've got it working?

842
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,750
Affirmative, yes. Although we have a problem.

843
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,430
There's an Alliance squadron approaching. Clear the area.

844
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,790
No, no, no, no! Tell them to hold off!

845
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,430
Jyn's on that platform.

846
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,390
Jedha...

847
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,630
Saw Gerrera. His band of fanatics...

848
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,350
their Holy City...

849
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,190
the last reminder of the Jedi, gone.

850
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,870
You'll never win.

851
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,230
Now where have I heard that before?

852
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,110
Relay from Captain Andor.

853
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,510
General.

854
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,180
Captain Andor requesting a delay on squadron support.

855
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,910
Alliance forces on site. Please confirm.

856
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,790
Get the squadron leader on. Get him on now!

857
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,220
They're already engaged, sir.

858
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,630
Jyn. No.

859
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,910
Return fire! To your stations!

860
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,150
Get our fighters in the air now!

861
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,430
Father!

862
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,630
Roger that. 3 through 7.

863
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,870
Fall back! Fall back!

864
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,030
Director, we need to evacuate.

865
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,550
Papa. Papa, it's me.

866
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,340
It's Jyn.

867
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,150
Jyn?

868
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,620
Stardust.

869
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,670
Papa.

870
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,630
I've seen your message.

871
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,750
The hologram, I've seen it.

872
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,830
It must be destroyed.

873
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,030
I know. I know.

874
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:35,870
We will.

875
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,300
Jyn.

876
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,030
Look at you.

877
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,750
I have so much to tell you.

878
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,510
Papa.

879
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:01,470
No.

880
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,670
No! Papa.

881
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,310
Papa, come on!

882
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,110
Over there! Take 'em down.

883
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,470
Come on. Papa. Come on.

884
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,790
Jyn, we gotta go. Come on.

885
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,360
I can't leave him.

886
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,670
Listen to me, he's gone.

887
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,590
Nothing you can do. Come on.

888
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,110
- I can't leave him.
- Come on!

889
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,430
I can't.

890
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,670
Move!

891
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,870
- This way, this way!
- Down!

892
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,230
Come on! Come on!

893
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:56,710
Well done.

894
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,070
You're a rebel now.

895
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:06,950
Let's go! Let's go!

896
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,510
Come on, let's move!

897
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,590
Come on, let's get out of here!

898
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,160
Move, move, move!

899
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,230
Okay, K-2. Let's go!

900
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,550
Copy that.

901
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,590
Ion thrusters low until we've cleared the storm.

902
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:37,980
Understood.

903
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,640
You lied to me.

904
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,990
You're in shock.

905
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,790
You went up there to kill my father.

906
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,470
You don't know what you're talking about.

907
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,990
Deny it.

908
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,950
You're in shock and looking for some place to put it.

909
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,310
I've seen it before.

910
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,630
I bet you have.

911
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,630
They know.

912
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,990
You lied about why we came here and you lied about why you went up alone.

913
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,030
I had every chance to pull the trigger...

914
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,830
but did I?

915
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,510
Did I?

916
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,470
You might as well have.

917
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,830
My father was living proof...

918
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,270
and you put him at risk.

919
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,790
Those were Alliance bombs that killed him.

920
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,480
I had orders...

921
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,790
orders that I disobeyed.

922
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,480
But you wouldn't understand that.

923
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,710
Orders?

924
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,830
When you know they're wrong?

925
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,830
You might as well be a Stormtrooper.

926
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,320
What do you know?

927
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,710
We don't all have the luxury of deciding...

928
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,190
when and where we want to care about something.

929
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,950
Suddenly the Rebellion is real for you.

930
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,270
Some of us live it.

931
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,270
I've been in this fight since I was 6 years old.

932
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,830
You're not the only one who lost everything.

933
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:15,750
Some of us just decided to do something about it.

934
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,710
You can't talk your way around this.

935
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,960
I don't have to.

936
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,320
Yavin 4.

937
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,230
Make sure they know we're coming in with a stolen ship.

938
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,150
Anybody else?

939
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,630
My lord, Director Krennic...

940
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,790
has arrived.

941
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,420
Director Krennic.

942
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,670
Lord Vader.

943
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,910
You seem unsettled.

944
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,270
No...

945
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,550
just pressed for time.

946
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,030
There's a great many things to attend to.

947
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,600
My apologies.

948
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,070
You do have a great many things to explain.

949
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,630
I delivered the weapon the Emperor requested.

950
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,590
I deserve an audience...

951
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:09,710
to make certain that he understands its remarkable...

952
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,150
potential.

953
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,510
Its power to create problems has certainly been confirmed.

954
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,590
A city destroyed...

955
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,710
an Imperial facility openly attacked.

956
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,150
It was Governor Tarkin that suggested the test.

957
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,990
You were not summoned here to grovel, Director Krennic.

958
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,110
No...

959
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,190
There is no Death Star.

960
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,550
The Senate has been informed...

961
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,030
that Jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster.

962
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,230
Yes, my lord.

963
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,870
I expect you not to rest until you can assure the Emperor...

964
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,470
that Galen Erso has not compromised

965
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,870
this weapon in any way.

966
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,230
So I'm still in command?

967
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,310
You'll speak to the Emperor about...

968
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:16,210
Be careful not to choke on your aspirations,

969
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:17,790
Director.

970
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,070
We must scatter the fleet.

971
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,550
We have no recourse but to surrender.

972
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,310
Are we really talking about disbanding something...

973
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,470
that we've worked so hard to create?

974
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,230
We can't just give in!

975
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,310
We joined an alliance, not a suicide pact.

976
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,800
We've only now managed to gather our forces.

977
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:46,950
Gather our forces?

978
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,310
General Draven's already blown up an Imperial base.

979
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,800
A decision needed to be made!

980
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,510
If it's war you want...

981
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,070
you'll fight alone.

982
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,070
If that's how it's going, why have an alliance at all?

983
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:59,270
If she's telling the truth, we need to act now!

984
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,790
Councilors, please.

985
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,950
It is simple.

986
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,540
The Empire has the means of mass destruction...

987
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:05,830
the Rebellion does not.

988
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,790
A Death Star. This is nonsense.

989
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,510
What reason would my father have to lie?

990
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,350
What benefit would it bring him?

991
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,350
To lure our forces into a final battle

992
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,830
to destroy us once and for all.

993
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,790
Risk everything? Based on what?

994
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,150
The testimony of a criminal?

995
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,470
The dying words of her father, an Imperial scientist?

996
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,430
But don't forget the Imperial pilot.

997
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,150
My father gave his life so that we may have a chance to defeat this.

998
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:28,710
So you've told us.

999
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,150
If the Empire has this kind of power,

1000
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,510
what chance do we have?

1001
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,030
What chance do we have?

1002
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,670
The question is "what choice."

1003
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,510
Run, hide...

1004
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,070
plead for mercy, scatter your forces.

1005
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,030
You give way to an enemy this evil with this much power...

1006
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:48,110
and you condemn the galaxy to an eternity of submission.

1007
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,070
- The time to fight is now!
- Yes.

1008
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,350
Every moment you waste

1009
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,550
is another step closer to the ashes of Jedha.

1010
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,630
What is she proposing?

1011
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,790
Just let the girl speak.

1012
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,710
Send your best troops to Scarif.

1013
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,720
Send the rebel fleet if you have to.

1014
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,150
You need to capture the Death Star plans

1015
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,720
if there's any hope of destroying it.

1016
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,870
You're asking us to invade an Imperial installation...

1017
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,950
based on nothing but hope.

1018
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,430
Rebellions are built on hope.

1019
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,080
There is no hope.

1020
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,870
I say we fight.

1021
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,670
I say the Rebellion is finished!

1022
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,630
I'm sorry, Jyn.

1023
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,790
Without the full support of the Council...

1024
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,670
the odds are too great.

1025
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,960
General Syndulla,

1026
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,950
please report to the briefing room.

1027
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:10,670
You don't look happy.

1028
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,500
They prefer to surrender.

1029
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,550
And you?

1030
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,030
She wants to fight.

1031
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,270
So do I. We all do.

1032
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,510
The Force is strong.

1033
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,270
I'm not sure four of us is quite enough.

1034
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,800
How many do we need?

1035
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,280
What are you talking about?

1036
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,470
They were never gonna believe you.

1037
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,190
I appreciate the support.

1038
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,990
But I do.

1039
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,000
I believe you.

1040
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,270
We'd like to volunteer.

1041
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,830
Some of us...

1042
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,750
Well, most of us...

1043
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,590
we've all done terrible things on behalf of the Rebellion.

1044
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,840
Spies...

1045
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,390
saboteurs, assassins.

1046
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,990
Everything I did, I did for the Rebellion.

1047
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:12,830
And every time I walked away...

1048
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,390
from something I wanted to forget...

1049
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,190
I told myself it was for a cause that I believed in.

1050
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,790
A cause that was worth it.

1051
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,510
Without that, we're lost.

1052
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,350
Everything we've done would have been for nothing.

1053
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,220
I couldn't face myself if I gave up now.

1054
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,360
None of us could.

1055
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,790
It won't be comfortable.

1056
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,830
It'd be a bit cramped, but we'd all fit.

1057
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,600
We could go.

1058
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,390
Okay. Gear up.

1059
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,830
Grab anything that's not nailed down.

1060
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:03,790
Go, go, go!

1061
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:04,990
Jyn.

1062
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,990
I'll be there for you.

1063
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,870
Cassian said I had to.

1064
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,110
I'm not used to people sticking around when things go bad.

1065
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,280
Welcome home.

1066
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,270
May the Force be with us.

1067
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,150
Cargo shuttle, read back please.

1068
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,310
What's going on out there?

1069
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,430
That ship's off-limits.

1070
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,400
No one's supposed to be on board until further instructions.

1071
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:06,960
Yes, yes, we are.

1072
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,230
Affirmative.

1073
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,840
That's an impounded Imperial ship.

1074
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,190
What's your call sign, pilot?

1075
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,470
- Um...
- We have to go.

1076
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:15,990
It's, um...

1077
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,320
Say something.

1078
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,670
Come on.

1079
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,390
Rogue.

1080
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,190
Rogue One.

1081
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,590
Rogue One?

1082
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:29,190
There is no Rogue One!

1083
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,630
Well, there is now.

1084
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,430
Rogue One, pulling away.

1085
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,110
Pulling away.

1086
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,510
Despite what the others say, war is inevitable.

1087
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,670
Yes, I agree.

1088
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,990
I must return to Alderaan to inform my people

1089
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,990
that there will be no peace.

1090
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,830
We will need every advantage.

1091
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,350
Your friend...

1092
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,790
the Jedi.

1093
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,510
He served me well during the Clone Wars...

1094
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,110
and has lived in hiding since the Emperor's purge.

1095
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,680
Yes, I will send for him.

1096
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,110
You will need someone you can trust.

1097
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,070
I would trust her with my life.

1098
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,870
- Captain Antilles.
- Senator.

1099
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,030
I have a mission for you, sir.

1100
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,630
Okay. We're coming in.

1101
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:38,640
There's a planet-wide defensive shield...

1102
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,390
with a single main entry gate.

1103
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,150
This shuttle should be equipped with

1104
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,390
an access code that allows us through.

1105
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,870
Assuming the Empire hasn't logged it as overdue.

1106
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,270
And if they have?

1107
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,710
Then they shut the gate.

1108
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,240
And we're all annihilated

1109
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,550
in the cold, dark vacuum of space.

1110
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,910
Not me.

1111
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,820
I can survive in space.

1112
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,590
Okay.

1113
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,910
Here goes.

1114
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,910
Cargo shuttle SW-0608 requesting a landing pad.

1115
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:28,030
Cargo shuttle SW-0608,

1116
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,990
you're not listed on the arrival schedule.

1117
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:32,190
Acknowledged, Gate Control.

1118
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,070
We were rerouted from Eadu flight station.

1119
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:36,510
Transmitting clearance code now.

1120
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,040
Transmitting.

1121
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,270
Cargo shuttle, SW-0608...

1122
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,790
- you are cleared for entry.
- Yes!

1123
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,350
Impressive.

1124
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,310
I'll tell the others.

1125
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,150
Okay.

1126
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,950
Tractor beam test in bays 2 through 8.

1127
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:19,310
Tractor beam test in bays 2 through 8.

1128
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,820
SW-0608, cleared for Landing Pad 9.

1129
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,790
Acknowledge, please.

1130
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,630
SW-0608 proceeding to LP 9 as instructed.

1131
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,870
Main building down there, what is it?

1132
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,550
That's the Citadel Tower.

1133
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,470
They keep all the Imperial structural archives up there.

1134
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,870
If the plans are anywhere, they'll be there.

1135
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,790
And the dish at the top, what's it for?

1136
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,240
I guess it takes a lot of signal to send those data files out.

1137
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,880
Landing track, engaged.

1138
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,830
Landing track locked.

1139
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,750
We're landing.

1140
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,480
We're coming in.

1141
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,390
Saw Gerrera used to say...

1142
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,520
one fighter with a sharp stick

1143
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:27,190
and nothing left to lose can take the day.

1144
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,030
They've no idea we're coming.

1145
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,950
They've no reason to expect us.

1146
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,160
If we can make it to the ground,

1147
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,830
we'll take the next chance.

1148
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,750
And the next. On and on until we win...

1149
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,070
or the chances are spent.

1150
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,030
The Death Star plans are down there.

1151
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,430
Cassian, K-2, and I will find them.

1152
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,750
We'll find a way to find them.

1153
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,430
Melshi...

1154
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,350
Pao...

1155
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:06,590
Baze, Chirrut...

1156
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,230
you'll take the main squad.

1157
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,990
Move east and get wide of the ship.

1158
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,390
Find a position between here and the tower.

1159
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,510
Once you get to the best spot...

1160
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,430
light the place up.

1161
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,870
Make 10 men feel like 100.

1162
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,110
And get those troopers away from us.

1163
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,190
What should I do?

1164
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,710
Keep the engine running.

1165
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,510
You're our only way outta here.

1166
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:03,750
Cargo shuttle SW-0608...

1167
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,310
be prepared to receive inspection team.

1168
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,510
Ready?

1169
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:22,670
Hello.

1170
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:23,870
Hey.

1171
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,230
Oh, you're probably looking for a manifest?

1172
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,310
That would be helpful.

1173
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,640
It's just down here.

1174
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,110
Director Krennic,

1175
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,070
we are entering the Scarif shield gate.

1176
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,910
General Ramda has been informed of your arrival.

1177
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,420
Good luck...

1178
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,230
little sister.

1179
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:19,750
Go! Go now! You're clear!

1180
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,220
All right, let's go! Come on. Move, move, move.

1181
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:30,390
925-H to transport control.

1182
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:34,030
925-H to transport control.

1183
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,750
I've got a bad feeling about...

1184
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:54,950
- K!
- Quiet!

1185
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,230
What?

1186
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:33,960
We need a map.

1187
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,680
Well, I'm sure there's one just lying about.

1188
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:39,350
You know what you have to do.

1189
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,670
One per pad.

1190
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,830
Pick your spot. We wanna draw them out.

1191
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,550
I'll call the timing. Go!

1192
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:19,390
Hey, did you hear the rumors?

1193
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,310
Yeah, the T-15s have been marked obsolete.

1194
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,190
Oh boy, it's about time for that.

1195
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,070
Hey!

1196
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,360
What the...

1197
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,710
Director, what brings you to Scarif?

1198
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,070
Galen Erso.

1199
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,830
I want every dispatch,

1200
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:01,430
every transmission he has ever sent...

1201
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,920
called up for inspection.

1202
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,070
All of them?

1203
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,060
Yes, all of them.

1204
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,470
Get started.

1205
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:42,630
K.

1206
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,910
Our optimal route to the data vault

1207
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,460
places only 89 Stormtroopers in our path.

1208
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:51,110
We will make it no more than 33% of the way before we are killed.

1209
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:58,790
Melshi, talk to me.

1210
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,030
Ready. Ready. Standing by.

1211
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,230
Light it up.

1212
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,390
Come on.

1213
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,300
Are we blind?

1214
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,000
Deploy the garrison!

1215
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,230
Move!

1216
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:54,670
Troopers!

1217
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:57,470
Troopers! Troopers on the left.

1218
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:59,120
Get in! Get in!

1219
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:25,350
Sir, it's Scarif base.

1220
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,990
They're reporting a Rebel incursion.

1221
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,670
I want to speak with Director Krennic.

1222
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,950
He's there, sir. On Scarif.

1223
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,670
The original plans for this station are kept there, are they not?

1224
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:35,430
They are.

1225
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,390
Prepare for the jump to hyperspace

1226
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,430
and inform Lord Vader.

1227
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,030
Can we help you?

1228
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:50,350
That won't be necessary.

1229
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,390
Senator!

1230
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,390
Senator!

1231
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:11,750
Stop right there, Private.

1232
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,240
Let him speak.

1233
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:16,390
Intercepted Imperial transmission, ma'am.

1234
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,150
Rebels on Scarif.

1235
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,630
I need to speak with Admiral Raddus.

1236
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,670
He's returned to his ship.

1237
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,510
He's going to fight.

1238
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:36,750
No!

1239
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:43,910
Attention, all flight personnel,

1240
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,550
please report to your commanders immediately.

1241
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,480
All flight personnel,

1242
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,000
please report to your commanders immediately.

1243
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,270
We have been redirected to Scarif.

1244
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,670
Pilots, you'll be briefed

1245
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:57,670
by your squadron leaders en route.

1246
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:00,270
May the Force be with you.

1247
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,550
Scarif? They're going to Scarif?

1248
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:06,270
Why does nobody ever tell me anything, R2?

1249
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,230
Move, move, move!

1250
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:17,590
Forward! Forward!

1251
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,870
Keep drawing them out!

1252
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,310
Pad 12, report to ground.

1253
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:28,630
Coming in on our flank. We need numbers.

1254
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,160
Pad 14, what's going on down there?

1255
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,040
Status please. All pads report in immediately.

1256
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,470
Oh, no. We have rebels everywhere!

1257
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:35,670
We're taking fire!

1258
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,990
Pad 12, Pad 14 request assistance.

1259
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,310
This is Pad 2. Pad 2.

1260
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,470
I spot 40 rebels heading west on Pad 2.

1261
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:44,830
Get on there. Tell him you're pinned down by rebels on Pad 5.

1262
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,720
This is Pad 5! We're being overrun! Help us!

1263
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,950
Pad 12, Pad 10, Pad 8, please confirm.

1264
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,390
Confirm and report.

1265
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:54,550
Get reinforcements down to Pad 5 immediately!

1266
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:59,510
This is not working, K!

1267
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:01,590
Right hand.

1268
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,030
Baze!

1269
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:26,630
- Baze!
- What?

1270
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,200
Run!

1271
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,350
Karabast! AT-AT!

1272
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:38,430
Move!

1273
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:58,350
This is Admiral Raddus of the Rebel Alliance.

1274
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:01,430
All squadron leaders, report in.

1275
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,070
Admiral, this is Blue Leader standing by.

1276
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:06,590
This is Gold Leader standing by.

1277
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,030
This is Red Leader standing by.

1278
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,430
Sir, those are rebel ships.

1279
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,590
Get Admiral Gorin, immediately!

1280
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,390
Director, the rebel fleet,

1281
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,110
it's amassing outside the shield.

1282
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:22,590
Lock down the base. Lock it down.

1283
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:24,430
- And close the shield?
- Do it!

1284
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,470
Red and Gold Squadrons, attack formations.

1285
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:29,110
Defend the fleet.

1286
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,190
Blue Squadron, get to the surface

1287
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,600
before they close that gate.

1288
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:33,550
Copy you, Admiral.

1289
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,350
Blue Squadron, on me!

1290
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,270
Copy, Blue Leader.

1291
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,320
Copy, Blue Leader.

1292
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:38,270
We won't have long.

1293
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:52,950
Close the field aperture now! Close it!

1294
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:58,990
Come on, come on, come on!

1295
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:00,630
Pull up!

1296
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:14,790
The rebel fleet has arrived.

1297
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:15,950
What?

1298
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:17,520
There's fighting on the beach.

1299
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:19,630
They've locked down the base.

1300
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,940
They've closed the shield gate.

1301
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,390
What does that mean?

1302
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:25,990
We're trapped?

1303
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:30,430
We could transmit the plans to the rebel fleet.

1304
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:33,710
We'd have to get a signal up to tell them it's coming.

1305
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:36,230
It's the size of the data files. That's the problem.

1306
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:37,910
They'll never get through.

1307
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,590
Someone has to take that shield gate down.

1308
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,150
Bodhi. Bodhi, can you hear me?

1309
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:45,030
Bodhi, tell me you're out there.

1310
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,070
Bodhi?

1311
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:48,560
I'm here.

1312
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:49,790
I was standing by.

1313
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,400
They've started fighting. The base is on lockdown.

1314
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:54,470
I know. Listen to me. The rebel fleet is up there.

1315
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:56,550
You've gotta tell them to blow a hole in the shield gate...

1316
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,870
so we can transmit the plans.

1317
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:02,150
Wait. I can't. I'm not hooked into the comms tower.

1318
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,350
We're not tied in.

1319
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,430
It's the only way we're getting them out of here.

1320
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:06,350
Find a way!

1321
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:08,550
Cover our backs.

1322
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:11,750
You'll need this.

1323
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:15,150
You wanted one, right?

1324
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:22,430
Your behavior, Jyn Erso, is continually unexpected.

1325
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:25,310
Jyn. Come on.

1326
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,060
Sa'kalla!

1327
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:47,990
Fire on my command.

1328
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:03,870
Look!

1329
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,630
Get ready. We're gonna have to go out there.

1330
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:20,630
What are you doing?

1331
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,430
They've closed the shield gate.

1332
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,270
We're stuck here.

1333
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:26,790
But the rebel fleet are pulling in.

1334
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:29,030
We just have to get a signal strong enough to get through to them...

1335
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:31,390
and let them know that we're trapped down here.

1336
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,350
For that, we have to connect to the communications tower.

1337
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:35,710
Now, I can patch us in over here, the landing pad.

1338
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:37,070
But you have to get on the radio.

1339
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:40,310
Get one of the guys out there to find a master switch.

1340
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,830
Get them to activate the connection between us and that comms tower.

1341
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:43,750
Okay?

1342
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,240
Then go!

1343
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,630
What's going on down there, Lieutenant?

1344
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:51,990
Unknown, sir.

1345
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:53,230
We can't raise them.

1346
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:54,470
All rebel frequencies are blocked.

1347
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:57,880
Keep trying. Engage those Star Destroyers

1348
01:41:58,040 --> 01:41:59,830
and let's start probing that shield!

1349
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:01,150
Yes, sir!

1350
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,320
We're going in.

1351
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:11,270
Stay with me.

1352
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:50,040
Schematic bank, data tower two.

1353
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,230
How do I find that?

1354
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:52,880
Searching.

1355
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:54,830
I can locate the tape,

1356
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:57,150
but you'll need to use the handles for extraction.

1357
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:03,670
What am I supposed to do with this?

1358
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:22,710
Well, finally.

1359
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,310
Wait! Stop!

1360
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,350
The rebels, they went over there.

1361
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,750
K, what's going on out there?

1362
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:30,750
There's one.

1363
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,750
Ah, well.

1364
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:44,830
Come on!

1365
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,190
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1366
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,590
We're starting our attack run on the shield gate.

1367
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:58,990
Keep it tight, and watch out for those towers.

1368
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,950
More fighters. Form out at six-five.

1369
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:19,550
Sir, enemy fighters coming in.

1370
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,990
Melshi! Melshi, come in. Are you there?

1371
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:31,470
Bodhi sent a signal from here. He's patching us in.

1372
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,590
But you guys have to open up a line for the tower.

1373
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,310
How? Please advise.

1374
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:37,710
There's a master switch at the base of the comm tower.

1375
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:40,340
Master switch? Describe. What are we looking for?

1376
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,630
What does it look like? The master switch? Where is it?

1377
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:46,390
U-wings, reinforce those troops on the beach.

1378
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,080
All fighters, on me.

1379
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:49,790
We have to shield them from air attack.

1380
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,790
Troop reinforcements. Here we go.

1381
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:59,390
For Jedha!

1382
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,350
We're having no effect on that shield.

1383
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:09,190
How much more can that thing take?

1384
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,190
Stick close, Red Five. Where are you goin'?

1385
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,950
They're all over me. I'm trying to lose them!

1386
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,510
This is Red Five! I need help!

1387
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:29,520
"Hyperspace tracking. Navigational systems."

1388
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:32,270
Two screens down.

1389
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:34,350
"Structural engineering." Open that one.

1390
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:37,670
I've got one on my tail!

1391
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:39,870
I'm on him!

1392
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:55,210
Project code names:

1393
01:45:55,210 --> 01:45:58,190
"Stellarsphere, Mark Omega, Pax Aurora."

1394
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:14,430
"War-Mantle, Cluster Prism, Blacksaber."

1395
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:16,230
What?

1396
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:17,680
"Stardust."

1397
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:20,910
That's it.

1398
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,870
How do you know that?

1399
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,120
I know because it's me.

1400
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:30,790
Hey, you! Identify yourself.

1401
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:35,750
I can...

1402
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,630
Incoming fire! Get cover!

1403
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,790
K, we need the file for Stardust.

1404
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:52,670
Stardust.

1405
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:57,790
That's it.

1406
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:20,310
K?

1407
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:21,950
Climb.

1408
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:23,150
Climb.

1409
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:26,990
You can still send the plans to the fleet.

1410
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:29,230
If they open the shield gate...

1411
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,510
you can broadcast from the tower.

1412
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,070
Locking the vault door now.

1413
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,110
K?

1414
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:36,190
K!

1415
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:37,870
- Goodbye.
- K!

1416
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:57,830
Sir, unauthorized access at the data vault.

1417
01:47:59,000 --> 01:47:59,950
What?

1418
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,670
It's just come in, sir.

1419
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,270
Send my guard squadron into battle.

1420
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,110
Two men with me, now.

1421
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:12,350
Get that beach under control!

1422
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:16,140
Bodhi, are you there? Did you call the fleet?

1423
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,070
I can't get to the shuttle.

1424
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:20,390
I can't plug in.

1425
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,190
You have to. They have to hit that gate.

1426
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,710
If the shield's open, we can send the plans.

1427
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:58,070
General, behind you!

1428
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:12,230
Step back.

1429
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:23,070
We're going down!

1430
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,030
Come on!

1431
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:32,990
Melshi, Melshi.

1432
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:34,380
Come in, please.

1433
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:35,820
I'm tied in at my end.

1434
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:36,990
I just need an open line.

1435
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:38,710
Hang on.

1436
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:41,470
The master switch.

1437
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:43,990
It's over near that console.

1438
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:48,510
I'm going!

1439
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,470
I've got it!

1440
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:02,790
Careful!

1441
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,470
You okay?

1442
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:14,990
Jyn!

1443
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:35,310
I'm one with the Force, the Force is with me.

1444
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:37,390
I'm one with the Force, the Force is with me.

1445
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:38,270
Chirrut!

1446
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:51,350
I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.

1447
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,110
I'm one with the Force, the Force is with me.

1448
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:54,350
I'm one with the Force...

1449
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:56,510
the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force...

1450
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:57,590
and the Force is with me.

1451
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:59,430
I'm one with the Force, and the Force is with me.

1452
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:02,330
I'm one with the Force, and the Force is with me.

1453
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:04,910
Chirrut! Come back!

1454
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:05,910
I'm one with the Force...

1455
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:15,590
Yes!

1456
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,390
Keep going! Keep going!

1457
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:27,790
Cassian!

1458
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:39,310
Chirrut! Come! Come with me!

1459
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:45,600
Chirrut!

1460
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:52,150
Chirrut.

1461
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:54,790
Don't go. Don't go.

1462
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:56,470
I'm here, I'm here.

1463
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:58,670
It's okay.

1464
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:03,030
It's okay. Look for the Force.

1465
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:04,510
Chirrut.

1466
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:07,390
And you will always find me.

1467
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:12,150
The Force is with me and I'm one with the Force.

1468
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:17,400
The Force is with me and I'm one with the Force.

1469
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:22,710
The Force is with me and I'm one with the Force.

1470
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:39,190
Deflector shields down to 50%! We're sustaining heavy damage!

1471
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:41,310
There's no turning back now!

1472
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:42,960
We have to press the attack!

1473
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,350
Hit that opening!

1474
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:51,590
We see it, Gold Leader.

1475
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,350
Ion torpedoes away!

1476
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:04,190
What's happening?

1477
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:06,030
We've lost engine power, sir.

1478
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:11,190
That Star Destroyer's disabled.

1479
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:15,750
This is Rogue One calling any Alliance ships that can hear me.

1480
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:19,070
Is there anybody out there? This is Rogue One.

1481
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,230
Come in, over!

1482
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:22,550
This is Admiral Raddus, Rogue One. We hear you.

1483
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:26,880
We have the plans.

1484
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:28,710
They found the Death Star plans.

1485
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:30,870
They have to transmit them from the communications tower.

1486
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,110
You have to take down the shield gate.

1487
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,350
It's the only way they're gonna get them through.

1488
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:38,590
Call up a Hammerhead corvette. I have an idea.

1489
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:40,230
Stand by, Rogue One. We're on it.

1490
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,070
This is for you, Galen.

1491
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:14,430
The Force is with me, and I'm one with the Force.

1492
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,190
Corvette Five, locked on target!

1493
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:09,950
Prepare for impact.

1494
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:23,710
Sublight thrusters, full power!

1495
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:02,790
Reset antenna alignment.

1496
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:05,880
Reset antenna alignment.

1497
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:08,870
Reset antenna alignment.

1498
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,230
Reset antenna alignment.

1499
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:38,110
Reverse engines! Full power!

1500
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:00,430
Antenna aligned.

1501
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02,150
Ready to transmit.

1502
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:37,990
Who are you?

1503
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,590
You know who I am.

1504
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:45,830
I'm Jyn Erso.

1505
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:48,350
Daughter of Galen and Lyra.

1506
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:49,790
You've lost.

1507
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:52,080
Oh, I have, have I?

1508
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:53,920
My father's revenge.

1509
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:55,600
He built a flaw in the Death Star.

1510
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:57,670
He put a fuse in the middle of your machine...

1511
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:59,790
and I've just told the entire galaxy how to light it.

1512
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:03,270
The shield is up.

1513
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,790
Your signal will never reach the rebel base.

1514
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:07,990
All your ships in the air will be destroyed.

1515
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:09,990
I lose nothing but time.

1516
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:12,230
You, on the other hand...

1517
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:15,430
die with the Rebellion.

1518
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:47,310
Transmitting.

1519
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:50,710
Transmitting.

1520
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:55,750
Admiral, receiving transmission from Scarif.

1521
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:07,230
Leave it, leave it!

1522
02:00:07,480 --> 02:00:08,550
That's it.

1523
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:10,950
That's it.

1524
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:13,390
Let's go.

1525
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:15,430
Transmission received.

1526
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:17,910
Admiral, we have the plans!

1527
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:19,560
She did it!

1528
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:24,190
Do you think anybody's listening?

1529
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:26,350
I do.

1530
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:29,830
Someone's out there.

1531
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:34,110
Sir, we're detecting a massive object

1532
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,390
emerging from hyperspace.

1533
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:44,030
Sir, shall I begin targeting their fleet?

1534
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,350
Lord Vader will handle the fleet.

1535
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:49,750
Target the base at Scarif, single reactor ignition.

1536
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,110
Yes, sir.

1537
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,310
Come on.

1538
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:23,310
You may fire when ready.

1539
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:29,870
Commence primary ignition.

1540
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:55,350
Rogue One, may the Force be with you.

1541
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:02,510
All ships prepare for jump to hyperspace.

1542
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:37,190
Your father would have been proud of you, Jyn.

1543
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:53,750
The rebel flagship is disabled, my lord...

1544
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:56,110
but has received transmissions from the surface.

1545
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:58,830
Prepare a boarding party.

1546
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:00,560
Yes, my lord.

1547
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:37,150
Hurry!

1548
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:43,150
Let's go! We gotta go, now!

1549
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,630
Move! Move! Move!

1550
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:48,950
Hurry. Let's go!

1551
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:50,110
Let's go!

1552
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:51,230
It's stuck!

1553
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:53,630
Hey!

1554
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,320
Hey! Help!

1555
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:13,310
Open fire!

1556
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:20,150
Help us!

1557
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:24,750
It's jammed!

1558
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:26,830
Pull it!

1559
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:33,470
Pull it!

1560
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:38,870
Here! Here!

1561
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:40,630
Take it! Take it!

1562
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:49,350
Launch!

1563
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:18,830
Make sure you secure the airlock.

1564
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:20,710
And prepare the escape pods.

1565
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:25,870
Your highness.

1566
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:28,670
The transmission we received.

1567
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:31,390
What is it they've sent us?

1568
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:34,510
Hope.
