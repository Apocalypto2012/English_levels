1
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,111
Detective Kim.

2
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,333
You've come all the way to the end.

3
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,391
Is it though?

4
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,855
Stop doubting everything.

5
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,192
But, Detective Kim...

6
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,320
what's left after all this?

7
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:16,326
An old cop full of regrets and pain.

8
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,872
I'm just an old cop...

9
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,293
full of regrets and pain now.

10
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,591
Hyeonseok!

11
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,309
Hyeonseok!

12
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:42,727
Taekrok...

13
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,853
Hey, you...

14
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,189
-I'm sorry.
-Yeongdu!

15
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,403
Yeongdu!

16
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,447
Yeongdu!

17
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,782
Seonga!

18
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,289
Jinseok!

19
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,216
Yeon Juhyun!

20
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,305
Are you all right?

21
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,854
Do you think all the choices you made...

22
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,648
were the right ones?

23
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,569
Back then,

24
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,532
I didn't have a choice.

25
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,831
Jiu!

26
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,624
Dad!

27
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,418
Dad!

28
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,006
Dad!

29
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,525
When did everything start to go wrong?

30
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,493
I only wanted to live a normal life.

31
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,791
I shouldn't have become a cop
in the first place.

32
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,925
That's when it all began.

33
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:46,035
SHADOW DETECTIVE SEASON 2

34
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,725
Here.

35
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,104
The bloodstains found
in the Geumjeong Society's car

36
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,231
were found to be from Team Leader Han.

37
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,942
Also, a fisherman spotted the car

38
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,070
close to where
Team Leader Han's body was found.

39
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,196
There is circumstantial evidence

40
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,114
that it was deleted
on Chief Baek's orders.

41
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,660
The Youngseo Provincial Police
summoned Chief Baek because of it.

42
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,538
They can't hold him for long
with only circumstantial evidence.

43
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,666
Choi Dohyung wouldn't let Chief Baek
just stay there.

44
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,918
What about Director Kwon?

45
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,462
Gyeongchan's digging into the guys
who got caught yesterday,

46
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,588
so we should have something soon.

47
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,090
At seven o'clock tonight,

48
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,259
once his initiation ceremony is over,
Dohyung will have political authority.

49
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,512
We'll stop them somehow.

50
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,853
Yes, go ahead.

51
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,897
I checked
their recent financial transactions

52
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,192
and they sent bundles of cash
a few times to one car rental company.

53
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,318
So I looked into it.

54
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,821
They operate illegal taxis
throughout the Gangnam area

55
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,489
and secretly sell cars
with fake registrations too.

56
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,573
Who's the owner?

57
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,367
I'll send you his information right now.

58
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,758
Why aren't you eating?

59
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,845
Why did you ask to see me again?

60
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,808
Last time,
you said you didn't know anything.

61
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:24,193
You know, you're at fault too.

62
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,739
You should have told me
that it was about your father.

63
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,118
I see you did a background check on me.

64
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,829
I'm also a father to a daughter.

65
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,249
It truly is unfortunate.

66
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,296
Just...

67
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,966
Just get to the point, please.

68
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,968
It's simple.

69
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,387
The man who killed your father.

70
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,432
I can help you catch him.

71
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,769
But you have to do one thing for me.

72
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,064
What do you want?

73
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,900
The man who did this to me.

74
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,068
All you have to do is take him down too.

75
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,281
Choi Dohyung.

76
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,162
The leader of the Geumjeong Society
is Choi Dohyung.

77
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,136
Hey. Where is it?

78
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,429
The second floor.

79
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,231
Hello.

80
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,734
-We're with Geumo Police.
-What?

81
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,034
Taekrok.

82
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,829
You're the one who said
we should help each other.

83
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,456
It's been a while.

84
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,098
Yes?

85
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,641
I sent you
the information you asked for.

86
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,352
Why do you need a disciplinary report
from 20 years ago?

87
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,563
There's something I have to check.

88
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,439
DISCIPLINARY REPORT

89
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,858
NAME: KIM TAEKROK

90
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,319
Team Leader Yeon,

91
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,779
I told you to stop looking into...

92
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,493
HE IS SUSPENDED FOR 3 MONTHS
AND DEMOTED BY ONE RANK.

93
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,496
HE FORMED AN ILLEGAL PRIVATE ORGANIZATION
WITHIN THE SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT...

94
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,126
The only one who's made it out alive

95
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,961
from all this chaos.

96
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,299
Kim Taekrok and Choi Dohyung.

97
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,343
There's definitely
something between the two.

98
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:59,932
That explains why he killed Kook Jinhan,
but kept Kim Taekrok alive.

99
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,979
The ones who won't be swayed
and will catch Choi Dohyung

100
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,481
are just me and you.

101
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,235
At least the two of us
share the same goal.

102
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,074
ILLEGAL PRIVATE ORGANIZATION (A.K.A BST)

103
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,704
LIST OF CARS

104
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,501
Look, I only did what they asked me to do.

105
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,171
All these fake registration vehicles,
illegal cars, and loans.

106
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,922
Director Kwon managed all of them.

107
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,341
All I did was send money

108
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,967
to the merchants' association
when he told me to.

109
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,347
If I give you this,
you'll let me go, right?

110
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,270
All I did was trust Dohyung
and do whatever he told me to do.

111
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,863
Use this list of cars
and catch Director Kwon with the police.

112
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,365
-Yes, sir.
-Also...

113
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,578
Take him to the station.

114
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,706
Taekrok.

115
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,041
Let's go.

116
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,436
2023 YOUNGSEO WELFARE FOUNDATION
DONATION RECORDS

117
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,772
Director Kwon got the funds,

118
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,149
then the money was laundered
through business transactions.

119
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,235
Then it was donated to the foundation.

120
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,989
Choi Dohyung used this money
to operate the Geumjeong Society.

121
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,742
FRESH MEAT RESTAURANT
HWANG JINSEOK

122
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,426
Records of Choi Dohyung's corruption.

123
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,471
There should be something else
before this.

124
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,058
Did you talk to the director
of the inspection department?

125
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,814
Yes. Once I have the evidence,
the agency will be on it.

126
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,326
This was taken
near the scene of the accident

127
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,328
as Detective Yeon Sanghoon was dying.

128
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,560
The man who killed my father...

129
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,147
was Chief Baek?

130
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:37,858
Yes.

131
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,493
I believe
a witness at the time stated that...

132
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,079
the vehicle was black.

133
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,455
Choi Dohyung must've taken care of it.

134
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,960
You'll find the details of the witness
who was bribed inside as well.

135
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:02,508
This should be enough evidence
to get a reinvestigation started.

136
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,536
The chief of the inspection department

137
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,537
is on the move again.

138
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,873
Rumor is there's going to be

139
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:38,043
an extensive internal investigation
starting with Yeon Sanghoon's death.

140
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,378
Who started this?

141
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,047
As far as I know,
it's Detective Yeon Juhyun.

142
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,477
What brings you here, Team Leader Yeon?

143
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,730
Was it really you?

144
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,108
Did you...

145
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,070
kill him?

146
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,116
Are you the one who killed...

147
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,579
Detective Yeon Sanghoon?

148
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,458
Yeon Sanghoon? Who's that?

149
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,419
And why would you say I killed him?

150
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,809
December 22, 2005.

151
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,980
You killed Detective Yeon Sanghoon

152
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,983
by performing a hit-and-run with a car.

153
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,654
You even bribed the witness
to tamper with the case.

154
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,114
Is that right?

155
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,660
I don't know
what on earth you're talking about.

156
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,537
Why would I do such a thing?

157
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,206
So why did you do such a thing?

158
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,167
Why did you do it?

159
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,295
Why did you kill him?

160
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,967
Did Detective Yeon Sanghoon too persistent
in chasing the Geumjeong Society?

161
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,554
And what's a Geumjeong Society?

162
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,225
You must have been very close to him,

163
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,687
seeing you're acting this way.

164
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,317
But I don't know him.

165
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,245
You might not know his name,
but you'll remember his face.

166
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:44,837
And this is a picture that was taken
near the scene of the accident.

167
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,422
That's your face, right?

168
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,425
I'm not sure.

169
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,137
I don't understand
why on earth you're being like this

170
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,930
with some old pictures.

171
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,270
So they're just old pictures to you.

172
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,865
The inspection department
will take this case up to headquarters.

173
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,161
I'll see you there.

174
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,841
Did you check the pictures I sent?

175
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,092
Yes. What are these?

176
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,553
It's evidence
of how Choi Dohyung funded his crimes.

177
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,514
Go investigate the businesses on the list.
And make it quick.

178
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,851
All right.
By the way, is it really true?

179
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,519
What is?

180
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,314
I heard the real culprit
of Yeon Sanghoon's murder was found.

181
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,857
And Chief Baek is the suspect.

182
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,063
Lee Youngho is the only one

183
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,357
who would give
that kind of evidence to Yeon Juhyun.

184
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,110
That old fox.

185
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,736
I heard from the attorney

186
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,197
and it seems like
Chief Baek is very anxious.

187
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,534
If he decides to act out to save himself
or says something by mistake...

188
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,452
The initiation ceremony is today.

189
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,955
We have to stop him no matter what.

190
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,375
Won Jaegu, how dare you betray me?

191
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,338
Is Judge Kim
the one in charge of warrants?

192
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,381
Yes.

193
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,426
Neither Kim Taekrok nor Lee Youngho
will stop here.

194
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,389
The Geumjeong Society cannot suffer
any more losses.

195
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,934
There needs to be a sacrifice.

196
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,112
LIEUTENANT KIM TAEKROK

197
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,494
Yes.

198
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,960
Okay. I have something to discuss anyway.

199
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,964
I checked the car owners,
but they weren't connected to Geumjeong.

200
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,215
Another dead-end.

201
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,467
-How many cars do we have left?
-More than half.

202
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,846
-Think we'll catch him within the day?
-We have to.

203
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,434
After the initiation ceremony,
Choi Dohyung will have gained authority.

204
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,394
If we catch Director Kwon then,
he'll slip away.

205
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,854
Then everyone will be in danger.

206
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,940
Including us and Taekrok.

207
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,321
Let's do whatever we can.

208
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,867
Okay. Let's do it.

209
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,443
Where did you get the evidence
that it was Chief Baek?

210
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,653
I got it from Lee Youngho.

211
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,988
What?

212
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,951
Why on earth...

213
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,209
When did you find out Choi Dohyung
was the leader of the Geumjeong Society?

214
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,511
Did you come to hesitate
when you found out...

215
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,429
that it was Choi Dohyung?

216
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,430
No.

217
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,515
Choi Dohyung seems to think so.

218
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,894
Last year, and then at the safe house.

219
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,021
He didn't kill you.

220
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,773
Team Leader Yeon.

221
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,817
Also, when did you find out...

222
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,988
that the BST you two made together...

223
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,033
was related to the Geumjeong Society?

224
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,257
Okay.

225
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,343
I understand you resent me for it.

226
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,513
Do not judge how I would feel.

227
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,818
If I had dissolved BST back then,
Geumjeong Society simply wouldn't be.

228
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,195
If I had done that,

229
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:07,242
your father wouldn't have died
at the hands of the Geumjeong Society.

230
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,166
I'm sorry, Team Leader Yeon.

231
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,879
There's no need to apologize.

232
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,466
I don't hold any grudges against you.

233
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,429
What angers me is that...

234
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,641
you're involved in this investigation.

235
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,023
Okay.

236
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,906
Anyway, you can't work with Lee Youngho.
He's only taking advantage of you.

237
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,032
You have no right...

238
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,952
to give me such advice.

239
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,207
You have no right.

240
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,914
The Upright Country Party and Kim Jinsun,

241
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,040
the Youngseo governor-elect,

242
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:40,961
have expressed their willingness to set up
a special investigation team

243
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,589
under the leadership
of Director Choi Dohyung

244
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,842
to thoroughly investigate
the current corruption scandal.

245
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,720
The investigation team is composed
of highly reliable professionals,

246
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,347
including incumbent detectives

247
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,351
and Director Choi Dohyung,
who has recently joined our party.

248
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,230
The specific plan of action
will be announced at 7 p.m.

249
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,649
during Director Choi Dohyung's
initiation ceremony.

250
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,234
Director Choi said he will announce...

251
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,070
You said that Chief Baek's arrest warrant
was rejected?

252
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:07,988
Yes, sir.

253
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,240
I didn't know
he'd take care of it so quickly...

254
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,372
Choi Dohyung is playing
every single one of us.

255
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,459
And where the hell is Secretary Cha?
I can't get a hold of him.

256
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,668
I'll look into it.

257
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,636
GEUMO CORRUPTION SCANDAL
INVESTIGATION TEAM SET UP...

258
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,142
Choi Dohyung, that scumbag.

259
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,031
Yes.

260
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,407
It must have been tough.

261
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,368
No, sir. Thanks to you, I'm over the hump.

262
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,039
But what will our next move be?

263
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,708
We'll talk about that in person.

264
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,543
Yes, sir.

265
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,148
Did you find it?

266
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,525
Here!

267
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,569
Right. It's 9221 from the list.

268
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,404
Good job, kid.

269
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,909
Yes, that's the guy. Okay.

270
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,664
I found it. It's me who did it. I did...

271
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:44,042
-Yes, Mr. Gu.
-Hey, we found it.

272
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,962
He just made a right on the intersection
at Geumo University of Education.

273
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,089
Okay. The intersection
at the University of Education.

274
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,257
Okay.

275
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,637
Yes?

276
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,807
Where are you?
Did you know Chief Baek was released?

277
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,272
All right, I'll look into it.

278
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:39,931
It was just recorded,

279
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,059
-so he should be in the area.
-Okay. Let's go that way.

280
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,769
Sure.

281
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,123
NO TRESPASSING
KEEP OUT

282
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,073
You look concerned.

283
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,120
Are you worried that I might abandon you?

284
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,205
Ah.

285
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,873
Of course not.

286
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,834
Thank you for handling the matter
so quickly.

287
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,589
Come have a drink.

288
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,590
Yes, sir.

289
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,144
It's been a while
since we had a drink just the two of us.

290
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,106
Yes, sir. It has.

291
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,402
I've come this far all thanks to you.

292
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:20,573
Now, our heyday,
the age of the police is finally arriving.

293
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,577
I will continue to do my best
until the end.

294
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,044
You've served your purpose
more than enough.

295
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,640
Where is Chief Baek right now?

296
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,683
There's a mountain cabin

297
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,060
owned by the Geumjeong Society.
He must have gone there.

298
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,187
I'll text you the exact location.

299
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:01,948
You and I.

300
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,660
We're no more than dogs to them.

301
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,289
But...

302
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,834
do we...

303
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,421
...have to live like this?

304
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,515
Scumbag.

305
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,434
Please understand.

306
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,813
This way,
we'll be able to cover everything up.

307
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,655
Just how many cops have you killed so far?

308
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,367
And you still say
what you're doing is for the police?

309
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,167
I shouldn't have trusted you
as he warned me.

310
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,171
It seems Kim Taekrok...

311
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,590
saw right through you.

312
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,384
Shit.

313
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,453
He sent Yeon Juhyun the location.

314
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,997
I'm also on my way.

315
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,373
Okay.

316
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,862
THE ADDRESS IS 47, SUAM-RO,
PANBONG-EUP, GEUMO-SI

317
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,830
-Hey.
-Taekrok.

318
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,165
Secretary Cha is dead.

319
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,837
And he sent an address
to Team Leader Yeon.

320
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,782
LIEUTENANT KIM TAEKROK

321
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,918
The person you are calling...

322
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,366
Put down your gun.

323
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,256
Your father's murderer
lies dead before you.

324
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,966
How does it feel?

325
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,023
Was it you?

326
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,235
The one...

327
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,656
who made the order to kill my father.

328
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,951
Choi Dohyung...

329
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,995
...was it you?

330
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,337
Why?

331
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,258
Why did you kill him?

332
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,928
Why did you kill so many police officers,

333
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,141
so many of your colleagues...

334
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,602
...and my father?

335
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,357
You can ask your father yourself.

336
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,527
Don't resent me for this.

337
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,488
It's nothing personal.

338
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,906
Choi Dohyung!

339
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,745
You relentless punk.

340
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,914
Stop.

341
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,215
Fine.

342
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,217
Shoot me.

343
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,554
Can you do it?

344
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,683
Do you still not understand?

345
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:30,855
It's the useless sense of justice of yours
that made you the pathetic mess you are.

346
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:35,026
You live alone
in that petty little studio of yours,

347
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,153
and you can't live
without those psychotic pills.

348
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,698
You've always been like that.

349
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,617
A weak-minded cop

350
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,078
trapped inside the trauma
that he brought upon himself!

351
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,677
Dad!

352
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,125
Let's stop this.

353
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,642
No!

354
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,479
No. No!

355
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,273
Detective Kim!

356
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,483
Please.

357
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,319
Please!

358
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,739
No, please!

359
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,953
You scumbags!

360
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,585
Now, this makes a better picture.

361
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:02,089
A detective kills the leader of BST
to avenge her father and commits suicide.

362
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,591
I will arrange it that way.

363
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,600
It's time for you to go, sir.

364
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,684
Okay.

365
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,687
Wrap things up.

366
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,210
You're up.

367
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,675
What were you dreaming about?

368
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,888
Did I say something?

369
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,475
You said you weren't wrong this time.

370
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,571
What are you going to do when you retire?

371
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,781
Retire?

372
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,325
Is that too far into the future?

373
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,744
10 years will fly by in no time.

374
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,581
Is there anything you want to do?

375
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,544
There's something I don't want to do.

376
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,216
Running like hell.

377
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,386
If I retire...

378
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,889
I'm never running again.

379
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,349
Chasing people.

380
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,644
Or being chased.

381
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,233
Right, there's nothing
as exhausting as that.

382
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,530
But, Taekrok.

383
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,867
Now's not the time.

384
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,539
You still have to run around
like your heart will burst.

385
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,340
Promise me that you will.

386
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,602
Well then, I'll get going now.

387
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,940
Hyeonseok.

388
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,862
I'll see you again.

389
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,703
Tomorrow's too soon,
and 30 years would be too late.

390
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,581
At a reasonable time.

391
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,253
See you, Taekrok.

392
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,098
We will now begin the initiation ceremony

393
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,477
of Director Choi Dohyung
of the Youngseo Welfare Foundation.

394
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,479
Please give a big hand for Director Choi!

395
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:12,024
A NATIONAL HERO! WE WELCOME CHOI DOHYUNG
TO THE UPRIGHT COUNTRY PARTY.

396
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,659
UPRIGHT COUNTRY PARTY

397
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:39,259
Thank you, everyone,
for taking the time to come here today.

398
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,095
Especially the reporters
who are here today,

399
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,638
I thank you in advance
for the favorable articles.

400
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:53,607
Today, it feels like
I'm back on my first day on the job

401
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,360
as a police officer donning my uniform.

402
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:03,117
Up until now, you've given me
the undeserved title of a hero

403
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,578
and sent a lot of love and support my way.

404
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,163
To be honest,

405
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:12,042
I've been ashamed of myself
for not being able to change anything

406
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:16,046
as I watched Korea
become blighted with crime.

407
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,550
We need to strengthen our police force,

408
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,260
so they can catch criminals
without concern.

409
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:24,680
That way, they can focus
on the safety of our citizens.

410
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,849
Please remember this.

411
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:33,605
Only a strong police force
can protect innocent citizens.

412
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,569
Now, I begin anew as a politician.

413
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,821
I will become the Choi Dohyung

414
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,366
who will meet your expectations
with clean and transparent politics.

415
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:50,497
Just like the first promise I made
the day I became a police officer,

416
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,959
I, alongside the Upright Country Party,

417
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,044
vow to protect the safety of Korea

418
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,506
and the peaceful daily lives
of the people...

419
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,216
Choi Dohyung!

420
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,201
Choi Dohyung!

421
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:30,913
You...

422
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,918
are under arrest for murder!

423
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,961
It's a pistol!

424
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,966
Superintendent Woo Hyeonseok!

425
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,888
Lieutenant Bae Yeongdu!

426
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,267
Superintendent Kook Jinhan!

427
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,232
Those are
the names of the officers you killed.

428
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,194
Detective Kim Taekrok.

429
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,072
What is the meaning of this?

430
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,911
Will you take responsibility
for your current actions?

431
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,084
It's all over, you bastard.

432
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,444
Over here. This way.

433
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,404
Come this way.

434
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,287
Thanks to
the tenacious efforts of a detective,

435
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:39,416
a massive crime cartel has been revealed,

436
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,252
involving political and business circles,
as well as the police and prosecution.

437
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,170
POLICE

438
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:47,257
The accusations
raised at the initiation ceremony

439
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,759
are being revealed one by one.

440
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,724
Many are in shock as it was revealed

441
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:59,561
that the armed force
made up of former police officers

442
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,105
was identified as the Geumjeong Society
led by Choi Dohyung.

443
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,483
Former Assemblyman Lee Youngho

444
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,610
is making the case
that he only committed the crimes

445
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:09,029
because he was threatened by Choi Dohyung.

446
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,531
But with new evidence
through additional investigation,

447
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,952
it seems that he will be facing
heavy punishment.

448
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:19,831
Youngseo District Court also issued
a search and seizure warrant

449
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,416
on the Youngseo Welfare Foundation

450
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,587
for a thorough investigation
of the accusations aimed at Choi Dohyung.

451
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,214
The Upright Country Party stated

452
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,007
they are aware
of the public's view on the matter

453
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:33,136
and will actively cooperate
with the investigations.

454
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,811
YEON SANGHOON

455
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,894
KIM TAEKROK

456
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,699
Where are you off to?

457
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,911
You won't tell me where you're going?
We're family.

458
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:23,997
NOEUL GOSIWON

459
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,044
Yang Gitae.

460
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,962
Go see your mother.

461
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,965
You're done with your retrial.

462
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,343
All right.

463
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,678
Live your life to its fullest.

464
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,306
Detec...

465
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,105
Taekrok!

466
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,066
You'll come back, right?

467
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,752
Did you come to see me in these?

468
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,089
Have I told you before?

469
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,970
The toughest but happiest time
in my entire police career

470
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,347
was my days
in the Mobile Investigation Unit.

471
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,481
Back then, we had no idea
we'd end up like this.

472
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,985
What are you hoping to hear from me?

473
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,365
Do you want me to beg for forgiveness?

474
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,992
No, you don't have to do that to me.

475
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,454
All I did was catch a criminal.

476
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,960
Because that's what I do.

477
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,763
For over 30 years,

478
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,808
I thought
that I didn't belong in this uniform.

479
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,230
But at this point,

480
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,609
these are all I have left.

481
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,445
I'll get going.

482
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,322
Kim Taekrok.

483
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,956
Do you think this is the end of me?

484
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,297
You'll come to regret this.

485
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,134
Eat well.

486
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,054
And live well.

487
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:18,296
SUPERINTENDENT WOO HYEONSEOK

488
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:35,647
SUPERINTENDENT WOO HYEONSEOK

489
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:12,934
MAY YOUR SOUL REST IN PEACE
TAEKROK

490
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:18,231
6 MONTHS LATER

491
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,566
-Hey.
-I don't want to.

492
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,109
You're going to regret this!

493
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,485
I didn't even say hello!

494
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,904
Will you be quiet inside the station?

495
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,740
Gosh, this is aggravating! What?

496
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,700
-Pipe down.
-Quit it, will you?

497
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,410
-Sit here.
-Okay, here.

498
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,329
-I'll sit down myself.
-You'll regret this!

499
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,289
-Where's your team leader?
-Hey, now!

500
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,333
-Dongbum!
-Mr. Gong!

501
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,751
What are you doing here?

502
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,919
-There's been a mistake...
-Bring me your team leader.

503
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,672
-Where is he?
-Settle down and tell me your names.

504
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,216
Hey, kid. Don't you know who I am?

505
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,634
And who could you be?

506
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,721
Goodness. Your team leader lives
in Geumo Apartment, right?

507
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,181
Yes. And?

508
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,434
Kid! I went to the sauna
with your team leader!

509
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,019
How could you go to the sauna...

510
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:57,979
-That's not right.
-Yes, I know that.

511
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,272
-Hey.
-Dongbum, you can't be lying.

512
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,359
Alongside your team leader,
I put the Geumjeong Society behind bars!

513
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:06,321
And put Choi Dohyung behind bars too.
I did that, man!

514
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,280
He did do all that.

515
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,491
Stop with the nonsense.
Just sit down and...

516
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,284
Hey, she's here. Seonga's here.

517
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,702
-Dongbum!
-Hello.

518
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,706
This is the Team Leader
of Homicide Team One, Lee Seonga.

519
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:17,624
You scared me.

520
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,667
Team Leader Lee. Look.
Isn't this too harsh?

521
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:20,919
We received a tip-off
for illegal wiretapping,

522
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:21,878
so we brought them in.

523
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,880
He's saying it's illegal, Seonga!

524
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,882
No, I can't let this one slide.

525
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,968
Hey, I helped you guys
and Taek the Dog so much.

526
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:29,969
How could you do this to me?

527
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,513
-Where's Son Gyeongchan?
-Dongbum!

528
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,848
Mr. Gu, hello.
What's going on?

529
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:37,602
He's a sergeant now.
Sergeant Son Gyeongchan. He was promoted.

530
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,896
You little... Then what about you?

531
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:43,149
I transferred to Homicide. Impressed?

532
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,443
You should be trying to talk things out

533
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,778
instead of yapping like that.

534
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,322
It's embarrassing. This is why
I didn't want to work with you!

535
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,242
You said you'd help your mom's business
once the retrial was over.

536
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,077
What are you doing
at an illegal mercantile agency?

537
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,037
-What did you say?
-Dongbum, you're making things worse!

538
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,539
-Hey!
-Come on, hands off!

539
00:56:57,622 --> 00:57:00,458
Fine. It's Trust Planning,
not a mercantile agency.

540
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,960
-That's right.
-Mr. Gu!

541
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,545
Just close up shop, all right?

542
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:06,256
Then I'll take the help you gave us
into consideration and be lenient.

543
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,299
-Hey, come on.
-Huh?

544
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,427
Dongbum! The manager position
at the studio is vacant.

545
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,720
I'll write a recommendation letter.
That would solve things!

546
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,056
You do that!

547
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,605
Get back here!

548
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:31,156
POLICE

549
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,840
JIU, I GOT THE POSTCARD YOU SENT ME.

550
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,654
MAY 2, 2024
WITH LOVE, DAD

KIM TAEKROK
KIM JIU

552
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,042
OLD Chief Constable!

553
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:28,713
There's trouble at the village
foreman's house. Come quick.

554
