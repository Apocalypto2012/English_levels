1
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,818
I must admit,

2
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:26,406
I've been seeing another shrink
while consulting you, I confess.

3
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,755
I would like to know,
when my life started to crack.

4
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:25,173
Mr.Adelaoui, stop harassing me.

5
00:01:25,757 --> 00:01:28,885
I need to work on the file, do you understand? Thank you.

6
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:31,222
Hi girls.
Hello.

7
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:32,331
Are you well?

8
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:33,507
I quit.
What?

9
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:35,684
It's a pigsty here.

10
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:38,353
That arrogance is cute.

11
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:40,105
You are gone all the time.

12
00:01:40,355 --> 00:01:42,983
In theory, you work because I'm away. Right?

13
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:46,695
We just met twice this week, and I'm your babysitter.

14
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:49,656
Don't lower yourself,
you're much more than that for me.

15
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:52,492
It's a dredge plan, isn't it?

16
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:54,536
I can go to court for harassment.

17
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:56,254
OK.

18
00:01:57,164 --> 00:01:58,165
I'm a lawyer.

19
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:00,468
All I do is look after your
daughters in your absence.

20
00:02:00,568 --> 00:02:01,668
Eliott,

21
00:02:01,757 --> 00:02:05,172
We cannot limit ourselves to
confined roles for existence.

22
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,175
I gave you so much freedom.

23
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:11,011
It's normal, you emancipate yourself.

24
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,763
What?
Well, yes,

25
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:14,848
you want to show you have character,

26
00:02:15,057 --> 00:02:17,684
that you are someone free, self-employed.

27
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:20,387
I see that in you, don't be deceived.

28
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:22,814
I see you.
Your daughters are unhappy.

29
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:24,332
Get out.

30
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:26,568
I quit.
Here,

31
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:29,946
I propose something. You go to take a break,

32
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:31,823
and to come back in one hour.
No.

33
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:33,075
I'll increase your pay by 5%.

34
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:37,579
20%? Do you want to ruin me?

35
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:39,665
OK! You take the food out of
the mouths of my sweethearts.

36
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:41,249
No problem.

37
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:44,211
OK. Get out of here.

38
00:02:45,003 --> 00:02:46,129
OK, get out. That's fine.

39
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:57,307
You're saving me, Sophie. I owe you.

40
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:03,021
Girls, this is Sophie.

41
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,190
She will be baby-sitting you. Behave yourselves.

42
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,943
I'm glad it's you, they adore you.

43
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:13,281
I prefer authority over obsequiousness.

44
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,372
Hey! Axel, congratulations!

45
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,224
My photo, my...Photo!

46
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:23,625
It's not done yet.

47
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:26,002
Let's not re-shoot that for the 500th time.
Yes. Yes.

48
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:27,462
Let's just get on with it. More enthusiasm.

49
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,631
I understand, more enthusiasm.

50
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:30,990
Yes.

51
00:03:31,717 --> 00:03:33,009
Hey! Wow!

52
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:35,137
Axel!

53
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:36,722
Well, this is it!

54
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,392
What's going on, what?
A wedding and everything is...

55
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,352
Axel! You are...

56
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:45,439
one of the four pillars of my existence.

57
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:48,859
Even though I don't understand what it means.

58
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:50,777
But it's just that...

59
00:03:51,737 --> 00:03:54,364
We didn't always much know in friendship...pardon!

60
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:55,632
Make it simple.

61
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:58,034
Yeah, more concise, more...
Yes.

62
00:03:58,785 --> 00:03:59,953
Punchy, maybe.

63
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:03,623
Hey! Axel! Uh...

64
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:06,835
What a wonderful day, uh...

65
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:08,712
My photo, what?

66
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:13,175
Life isn't a local phenomenon.

67
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:15,051
It is a miracle of life.

68
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,803
The enabling conditions

69
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:21,057
that made life possible on Earth.
Yes.

70
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:25,645
If you take the Big Bang and
not a trick, a separate point,

71
00:04:25,754 --> 00:04:30,317
if we take the planar satellite which
observes the astronomical radiation,

72
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,569
Yes.
...we are surrounded by the Big Bang.

73
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:36,281
We are surrounded, suddenly,
we get the feeling of being in a phew.

74
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,159
Extrapolating this idea that the universe is an egg,

75
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,703
we consider Him creating life.

76
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:44,331
We have a surprise alongside Vincent,

77
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,541
a little thing has been prepared for you.

78
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,909
Vincent!

* Then you told me... *
* "Honey" *

82
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:17,489
Maybe we are on the shelf of a mad scientist

83
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:19,616
who reflects on the concept of life.
Mm.

84
00:05:19,825 --> 00:05:23,328
We are at an advanced stage of
civilization which unites people.

85
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:24,487

91
00:05:55,081 --> 00:06:03,081

And even on the question of species barrier,

between ape and man for example,

96
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:31,271
it's very artificial, because the base is the same.

97
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,315
So this would not have been evolved

98
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:37,277
at the base, to make entities so diverse.

I spend my days with morons

103
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:22,948
who think of starting "The day today",

104
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:24,407
and will be acquitted.

105
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:27,243
You okay?

106
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:30,163
This girl is completely crazy,

107
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:33,667
We're going to separate. I saw her in bad shape.

108
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,627
Shit, but...

109
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:40,173
but you're going bad all the time.
No, no.

110
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,092
That was different.

111
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:49,391
Is that all you have to say?

112
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:50,942
Mr.Mallet?

113
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:52,435
Yeah!
Hey?

114
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:54,312
No, he's a guy I know.

115
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,055
What are you doing there?

116
00:07:56,064 --> 00:07:57,098
Good evening.

117
00:07:57,232 --> 00:08:00,610
Good evening, I am a distant cousin of the witness.

118
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:04,572
Okay, let me introduce a friend,
he is a former client.

119
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:06,866
What were you accused of?
Stoups.

120
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:08,159
Narcotics.

121
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:13,999
And by the way, I wanted to thank you
for getting me out of the business.

122
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:17,293
You never had the head of a dealer, anyway.

123
00:08:17,502 --> 00:08:19,254
That's nice of you.
It's true.

124
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:22,465
Oh bah! He was listening, he's a bit...

125
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:24,426
it's not going very well.

126
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:29,014
In any case, you look very content.

127
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:31,516
It's a lot of work, you know.

128
00:08:36,146 --> 00:08:37,897
Besides, I wanted to take advantage of it.

129
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:42,193
Actually, I'm looking for a job...
Yes.

130
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:45,030
I have nothing more to see in the middle, and all that.
Mm.

131
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:47,365
So if you hear about

132
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:49,659
an internship somewhere or something,

133
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:51,286
it would help me.
Okay.

134
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:55,248
Personally, I'm looking for a trainee, but...

135
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,917
No.
I'm already having trouble, you see...to pay,

136
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:00,587
so I haven't committed to anyone.

137
00:09:00,795 --> 00:09:01,796
If I hear...

138
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:04,299
I can work for free, for you.

139
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:06,134
Uh...yeah, well...

140
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:09,012
It seems strange to me, but...

141
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:12,140
But you never did it right!
No. No...

142
00:09:12,348 --> 00:09:14,559
I have the motivation, however, it's already...

143
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:16,227
Yes that's good.

144
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:18,855
I am worried about my future.
Me as well.

145
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:20,523
Oh good.
What do you mean?

146
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:22,442
I meant...mine.

147
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,777
Oh OK.
Yes. Yes.

148
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:27,238
It will be fine.

Maybe you don't remember,

179
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:33,633
you took out a knife

180
00:12:33,841 --> 00:12:35,885
to threaten her.
No, I didn't do that.

181
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:38,513
I didn't want to kill her, I'm innocent, okay?

182
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:42,183
She is obsessed with knives. She dreams of it.

183
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:44,686
She has plenty of knives,
she threatens me with it.

184
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:46,688
What's the point of accusing you?

185
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:48,356
She wants me to pay up.

186
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:50,775
Well, dammit, you know me!

187
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:52,735
I'm not capable of that.

188
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:54,737
I can't be your lawyer.

189
00:12:54,946 --> 00:12:58,950
It's been five minutes and
you bring up our friendship.

190
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:01,536
Ethically, it's not right.

191
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:05,832
I was at the your wedding, I can be called to testify. No.

192
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,709
Get Jamal, he's the best.

193
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:10,128
He does not believe me.
Yes, that's good!

194
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:12,505
If we accept all clients speak the truth,

195
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:14,048
we would be unemployed.

196
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,633
But you believe me.

197
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:19,679
Doesn't matter! I can't defend you
because you are a friend.

198
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:23,182
I would never measure up to this case.

199
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:25,893
You've won big trials.
I lost them!

200
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:27,161
A lot of them.

201
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,940
The ones I won were not
when the customer was at stake.

202
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:32,358
This is different.

203
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,570
Usually I don't care whether
they are guilty or innocent.

204
00:13:35,987 --> 00:13:37,780
Don't you want to defend an innocent man?

205
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:40,450
No, I prefer to defend a guilty person.

206
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:44,245
If you are innocent, what I would wish think is that
"you are my friend",

207
00:13:44,454 --> 00:13:47,040
I would be afraid, I would not have the right to make mistakes.

208
00:13:47,248 --> 00:13:49,375
I don't care about that! That's all in theory.

209
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:52,086
I'm in deep shit and I need help.

210
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:54,005
It's your job, I'll pay you.

211
00:13:54,756 --> 00:13:55,923
It's impossible.

212
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,632
You must be open to the world.

213
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:41,594
I already feel very open,
very explosive out in the world.

214
00:14:43,096 --> 00:14:44,889
I'm talking about a world of sex.

215
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:50,645
It's not for lack of trying, but...

216
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:54,649
I don't feel very concerned by sex, right now.

217
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:56,692
I don't want to hear your story.

218
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:57,985
And stop the drugs.

219
00:14:58,194 --> 00:14:59,487
I don't take drugs.

220
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:01,781
I don't want anything happening to you.

221
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:04,158
I prefer not to talk about my health.

222
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:06,285
I prefer to talk about love, money.

223
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:10,123
I say everything and not necessarily
what you come to hear.

224
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,086
I see someone spies on you.

225
00:15:16,212 --> 00:15:18,047
But I can't seem to see

226
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:19,966
who, nor how.

227
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:22,176
Someone is watching you.

228
00:15:24,095 --> 00:15:25,763
Hello. What are you doing here?

229
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:27,598
I was on the way to school.

230
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:30,309
No just kidding, I brought you your purse.

231
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:32,437
Thank you.
Girls!

232
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:35,940
I wanted to talk about something else...
Uh...

233
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:39,318
Come with me. Hold that for me, please. Thank you.

234
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:41,487
Hold on. Come, come.

235
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:45,032
Since my separation, I've lived with a friend.

236
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:48,494
And in fact, I've stopped dealing,

237
00:15:48,703 --> 00:15:51,747
so that I may pay more for the apartment
and I resume my studies.

238
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:54,500
But my dream is to be a lawyer.
Okay.

239
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:58,546
But in between drugs, bakery and avocado, it's a bit...

240
00:15:58,754 --> 00:16:00,131
Yes...no, no...

241
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:02,467
I would like to take up law studies,

242
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:05,344
and help you on the side...
Excuse me. Hello?

243
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,171
In the next call,

244
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,600
I'll let go of your cousin,
he'll have trouble finding a lawyer,

245
00:16:10,808 --> 00:16:12,059
24 hours before the hearing. OK?

246
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:17,273
What do you want?
Be your apprentice,

247
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,692
and eventually your personal assistant.

248
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:22,487
I'm looking for a babysitter.

249
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:26,240
Yes, that would includes this as well.
I could be your "Au pair".

250
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:28,618
And you have room for this?
No, it's true.

251
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:30,953
Among other things, it's not just that.

252
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:35,081
And I don't judge your way of life,
you can leave dragging your panties.

253
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:36,584
I could re-arrange with pleasure.

254
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:40,087
Well, no, not in that sense!

255
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,507
I misspoke.
Mm. Yes.

256
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:44,258
I could be...

257
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:45,760
your man from the shadows.

258
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:49,555
I could solve your problems and then, if you like,

259
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:50,890
become your assistant.

260
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:56,896
We could try out for a week.

261
00:16:57,104 --> 00:16:58,314
Yes.
Okay?

262
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:00,816
If it doesn't work out, we could stop there. OK?

263
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:03,277
Yeah.
Good. Okay.

264
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:05,738
Okay. Great.
One week.

265
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:09,742
Yeah, I can...
Where do I sleep?

266
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:12,119
Well, here. In fact, this is your bed.

267
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:15,248
There are only two rooms.
Oh OK! This is fine.

268
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:18,709
On a side note, no drugs here.

269
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:21,379
Oh yes, I'm in the clean phase of my life.

270
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:23,881
No worries there.
OK perfect.

271
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:28,469
Well, I'm going to wash myself.
I'm going to get ready.

272
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:30,137
Are you going out tonight?

273
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:33,474
No, I have an appointment with a guy from work.

274
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:36,477
Okay. Well, I didn't think so.
Could I cook?

275
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:39,939
Great! Grab that card from my purse for groceries.

276
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:41,691
Yeah OK!
Cool!

277
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:44,735
What's the code?
3668,

278
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:48,072
Girls, this is Sam who will take care of you.

279
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:08,134
It's beautiful!

280
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:12,513
It's very beautiful!

281
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:19,478
Don't you want to lie down?

282
00:18:39,415 --> 00:18:40,499
Is it okay?
Yeah, yeah.

283
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,711
Finally, Doc. I'm asking a lot of
questions about my life.

284
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:45,504
You're smiling. Is this a joke?

285
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,956
No.

286
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:48,424
No, I meant...

287
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,135
I'm talking about what you would like to discuss.

288
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:54,764
Bah! We could discuss that two seconds later, right?

289
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:57,975
Yes.
You see, I...

290
00:18:58,768 --> 00:19:01,062
I have a friend who asked me for help.

291
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:06,108
And if I did help, puts me in a complicated situation.

292
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:07,693
But I have to reassure him.

293
00:19:07,902 --> 00:19:11,030
I introduce people who I consider professionally,

294
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:13,032
and I hope it does.

295
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:14,441
But...

296
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,412
In the hindsight, I feel guilty
not being able to help him.

297
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:21,540
I'm wondering,

298
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,876
I don't know how to go about it.

299
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:25,211
You see?
Yeah.

300
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:33,177
It bothers me to let him down.

301
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:35,429
I understand.

302
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:39,850
It's complicated, he's a friend.

303
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:43,938
Finally we got together. He counts on me.

304
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:49,902
I can't read your mind, there.
Oh yeah.

305
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:51,153
Oh no.

306
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:56,242
OK, I'll be quiet. Let's start again.
OK.

307
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,543
But as his lawyer if I defend badly...

308
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:09,880
If he loses, I will not recover.

309
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,136
It will torture me. I'll have to ask myself
if I could have done better.

310
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:16,554
Well, come on, that's enough.

311
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:18,639
This isn't serious.
No.

312
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:19,932
Come on, it's okay.

313
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:22,935
This could evolve positively.

314
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:25,312
In any case, don't worry, I won't judge.

315
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:26,897
I was more in it, there.

316
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:30,151
Was it okay?

317
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:35,656
If you want to talk, I'm here.

318
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,666
You know, Sam,

319
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,502
I have imperfections which hides enormous qualities.

320
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:50,921
I don't doubt it.

321
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:57,595
Our proximity is a handicap,
this case must be made strong.

322
00:20:57,803 --> 00:21:00,264
If I accept, I need to understand why

323
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:03,726
Eve decided to stab herself, to accuse you.

324
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:05,227
I need to know everything.

325
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:06,812
How was it, sexually?

326
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:09,273
She wants me to pay for her ex.

327
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:12,026
Did she sleep with a lot of guys?
Yes.

328
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:16,489
We were two molecules that attracted but
one was full of gangrenous atoms.

329
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:18,908
Not too many metaphors with the judge.

330
00:21:19,116 --> 00:21:21,285
I'm paying all this for her ex-psychopaths,

331
00:21:21,494 --> 00:21:23,370
and she doesn't give in to sex.

332
00:21:23,537 --> 00:21:27,124
I didn't force her to live with me, I didn't tie her up.

333
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,418
I'm successful with women

334
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:31,670
and not wanting to stab one.

335
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:34,882
Stick to the question, Mr.Kossarski.

336
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:38,177
Yes. I never struck, offered resistance,

337
00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:39,461
and vice versa.

338
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:42,765
No! She says you snatched her panties violently.

339
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:44,809
No! I may have done it,

340
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:47,353
but in an act of sexual riches and fantasy.

341
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:49,438
In a playful way, not violence.

342
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:53,442
But no. Even if I wanted, that's impossible.
She did not wear it.

343
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:55,820
Let's come back to the seriousness of facts.

344
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:58,030
We don't solve a couple's disputes.

345
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,365
Of course.
Good.

346
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:02,159
During the act, did you see

347
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:05,371
anyone or a witness watch you?
No.

348
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:08,457
No human witness, but Jacques, her dog.

349
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,292
He was there and it bothered me.

350
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:11,919
Miss Scorr's dog?
Yes.

351
00:22:13,254 --> 00:22:15,631
And you saw him during the act?

352
00:22:18,092 --> 00:22:21,679
No, he was looking at me. And it disrupted me.

353
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:29,728
Are we putting him in jail?
Yes, we put him in jail.

354
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:31,856
Hello!
Hello.

355
00:22:32,189 --> 00:22:33,649
What are you doing here?

356
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:35,776
I can see my daughters, right?

357
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:39,029
Are you okay?

358
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:42,408
I'm part of a writers blog.

359
00:22:43,284 --> 00:22:45,411
You have a central place in my story.

360
00:22:45,953 --> 00:22:47,413
You inspired me a lot.

361
00:22:50,082 --> 00:22:52,293
Girls, stop playing, we're going to eat.

362
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:54,336
David, say goodbye to the girls.

363
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:56,755
OK, OK.

364
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,884
Don't underestimate my authority.

365
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,428
Don't underestimate my indifference.

366
00:23:02,636 --> 00:23:05,556
I'm worried, I was a no-go with the judge.

367
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:09,184
I thought she was going to throw out the complaint.
I'm anxious...

368
00:23:09,393 --> 00:23:11,854
Vincent! Calm down, I'll get you out of there.

369
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:14,607
I have not done anything, believe me. Talk to her.

370
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:16,108
The Convaincs,

371
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:18,903
it's unjust, irrational.

372
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:21,280
I can't talk to her.
Please.

373
00:23:21,488 --> 00:23:22,698
No!
This trial...

374
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:24,700
I don't have the right to do that.

375
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:26,660
Do you understand?
I'm on my knees.

376
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:28,913
Really, calm down. Get some rest.

377
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:30,289
Rest?
Ciao.

378
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,214
The judge advised me not to take this case.

379
00:23:39,423 --> 00:23:40,925
Why do you have that phone?

380
00:23:41,592 --> 00:23:42,760
It's unbreakable.

381
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:45,012
It's designed for the military.

382
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,266
Oh damn, that guy!

383
00:23:52,102 --> 00:23:53,103
Good evening.
Good evening.

384
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:55,731
I'm IntelloBG75,

385
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,025
Oh no, I don't think so.
Yes, yes.

386
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:00,653
Oh? I didn't recognize you. Ah yes.

387
00:24:01,695 --> 00:24:03,280
Good evening.
Good evening.

388
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:06,200
Over there.

389
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:16,126
Oh no, that's not what I thought I would do.

390
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:17,836
Sorry. No it's me.

391
00:24:18,045 --> 00:24:21,131
I don't want to. I prefer to get to know one other.

392
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,634
Why did you bring me to your room, then?

393
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:26,720
This is the only room where we can talk quietly.

394
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:31,684
Can I sit on the bed?
Yes.

395
00:24:32,142 --> 00:24:33,310
Yes of course.

396
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:38,857
We mustn't feel compelled, if we don't feel

397
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:41,318
any attraction for each other.

398
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:43,445
For you and for me.

399
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:45,089
We're still...

400
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:47,950
I find you very desirable.

401
00:24:50,703 --> 00:24:52,121
Did you want to drink something?

402
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,039
Do you have whiskey?
Yes.

403
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:56,000
I love whiskey with sugar.

404
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,585
Me too! I like it the same way.
Is that true?

405
00:24:58,794 --> 00:25:00,838
No, that was to find something common.

406
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,590
I don't know what's going on, it's difficult.

407
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,135
I don't see the emergency exit.

408
00:25:48,761 --> 00:25:49,762
Yeah.

409
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,346
Well, it's not far off.

410
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:53,323
What?

411
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:54,466
The exit.

412
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:57,311
We all look for it,

413
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:58,854
somewhere, right?

414
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:11,033
I wanted to drown myself in sex.

415
00:26:15,746 --> 00:26:16,747
Yes.

416
00:26:17,372 --> 00:26:18,957
That happen to you?

417
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:22,503
Perhaps, you need a vacation?

418
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,590
Shall I accompany you?

419
00:26:30,594 --> 00:26:32,387
Good and bad news.

420
00:26:32,596 --> 00:26:34,306
The maid?
Look.

421
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,060
I created an account and
asked the guests to be friends.

422
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:40,854
And they accepted?
Look at my picture.

423
00:26:41,063 --> 00:26:43,023
They don't know who I am. You get the idea!

424
00:26:43,232 --> 00:26:44,691
That's good. It's awesome.

425
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:49,113
And the bad news?
You know your ex's blog?

426
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:51,657
No why?
He wrote about you.

427
00:26:52,074 --> 00:26:55,077
Oh yes, no, I know. But I'm not interested.

428
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:56,370
Look at it anyway.

429
00:26:56,578 --> 00:26:59,748
Your name is Vicky Spock, you defend psychopaths.

430
00:26:59,957 --> 00:27:01,083
You are unstable.

431
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:03,710
He's talking about cases you've pleaded.

432
00:27:04,586 --> 00:27:08,757
He has a reading tomorrow with the
"Crazy Blogger Club".

433
00:27:09,216 --> 00:27:11,718
They meet up every Wednesday morning in a bar.

434
00:27:11,927 --> 00:27:14,388
They talk about literature in general.

435
00:27:14,596 --> 00:27:16,932
If not, their books, scenarios...

436
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:20,602
She didn't care what would
happen to this low level dealer.

437
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:23,480
The important thing was, to feel the €3,000,

438
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:27,067
the guy was paying in €10 bills,
to this shameless lawyer.

439
00:27:27,317 --> 00:27:31,363
Vicky S. splurged drug money.

440
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:35,409
In addition, she slept with senior judicial officials.

441
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:37,744
She had a relationship with a famous judge

442
00:27:37,953 --> 00:27:40,372
and contacted the press, nourishing hope

443
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:42,749
to entrust important business.

444
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,751
She represents the incompatibility

445
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,005
between a feminist stature to a humanist.

446
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:51,224
And her fascination for money and power.

447
00:27:51,233 --> 00:27:54,011
I watched as a hummingbird caught in the storm.

448
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:56,013
I was only a pawn, invisible,

449
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:58,390
but I could see everything in secret.

450
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:00,384
Thank you very much, David.

451
00:28:00,434 --> 00:28:02,436
It's great, there's everything...

452
00:28:02,644 --> 00:28:06,106
the intimate life that mixes with professional life,

453
00:28:06,315 --> 00:28:08,358
the bumpy side of legal affairs.

454
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:13,822
Makes great material to feed the blog.

455
00:28:14,031 --> 00:28:15,949
Don't hesitate to be interactive,

456
00:28:16,053 --> 00:28:18,994
this must be on the trans-media.

457
00:28:19,203 --> 00:28:20,662
Today,

458
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:23,040
so, offer your ideas, what not.

459
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:26,210
Go ahead, nurture the workshop with these ideas.

460
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:29,755
Yes. Flood the blogs and social networks.

461
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,049
Facebook, Twitter.

462
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:34,593
How could you write these rumors about me?

463
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:37,804
This is dangerous for me, for our children.

464
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:40,057
Is it because I didn't give you any money?

465
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:43,227
I regained the trust that I had lost.

466
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:46,146
I have a recognized talent, it's my job.

467
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:48,148
I'm sorry you didn't notice.

468
00:28:48,357 --> 00:28:52,027
I am inspired by my experience.
I always wanted to do that.

469
00:28:52,236 --> 00:28:54,655
You were in my life. This is auto-fiction.

470
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:56,740
You barely masked the names!

471
00:28:56,949 --> 00:29:00,410
You mess about with my reputation without
even thinking about the consequence.

472
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:02,996
You reveal things that I confided in you.

473
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:04,957
Do you realize the gravity of the situation?

474
00:29:05,165 --> 00:29:07,292
You put out confidential details.

475
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:10,629
It's just a bloody blog!
Just a bloody blog?

476
00:29:10,837 --> 00:29:13,257
Stop holding back information.

477
00:29:13,465 --> 00:29:15,926
You embalm a reality, I lived with.

478
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:19,471
Now this reality belongs to me and I want to share it.

479
00:29:31,608 --> 00:29:33,819
Hi Suzanna, I can't talk to you.

480
00:29:34,027 --> 00:29:35,061
Just 30 seconds.

481
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,447
I can't talk to you, you are a witness.

482
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:40,325
You are aware that you defend a monster?

483
00:29:40,534 --> 00:29:44,371
This asshole broke-up my marriage.
I'm sorry.

484
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:46,873
I have pictures when it was happened.

485
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:49,584
I spent 10 months for this day.

486
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:52,671
My parents took out a loan for €20,000,

487
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:54,506
I understand that.

488
00:29:54,715 --> 00:29:58,302
The investment of it, of course. And the work that went in.

489
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,220
But I have nothing to do with that.

490
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:02,055
The guy is a psychopath.

491
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:06,226
Listen, we'll talk about it, in a year's time. Sorry.

492
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:07,561
In a year?

493
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,313
This chapter is over,

494
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:12,357
Vincent risks great pain, he deserves a defense.

495
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:15,652
The guy is a misogynist. I would, would you?

496
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:17,070
No, this has nothing to do with it.

497
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,112
What has misogynist got to do,
with women as victims by nature.

498
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:22,102
I'm sorry! I've to go.

499
00:30:25,412 --> 00:30:26,538
Hello.

500
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,083
How's it going, girls?

501
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:33,003
Did you have a good day?
Yeah.

502
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:40,093
Did you know the judge arranged for

503
00:30:40,302 --> 00:30:42,679
an expert on Eve's dog?
Oh yeah?

504
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,140
Ouch.
Careful.

505
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:47,100
David showed me his script.

506
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:48,326
What?

507
00:30:49,353 --> 00:30:52,606
He's a neurotic blogger riding my back.

508
00:30:52,814 --> 00:30:54,024
I'm going to sue him.

509
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,377
Is it true your slept 497 times with a judge?

510
00:30:57,486 --> 00:30:59,145
No, of course not.

511
00:30:59,154 --> 00:31:03,575
When I hear we had sexual intercourse, it's all fiction.

512
00:31:05,452 --> 00:31:08,163
Girls, enough of the iPad, now.
Oh yes, no more.

513
00:31:09,456 --> 00:31:11,249
Girls, stop the iPad.

514
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:13,418
No, it's not good for you.

515
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:17,089
Come on, listen to me a little. Come on.

516
00:31:17,297 --> 00:31:19,383
Stop the iPad, give it to me.

517
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:23,303
Come on! Well, listen to me, here!

518
00:31:24,471 --> 00:31:26,139
Come on, give me that.

519
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:27,724
No.

520
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:31,853
Let go, it's mine.

521
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,707
The dog expert says, the smell is stressing him.

522
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:55,210
This dog is jealous.
Eve keeps him for protection,

523
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:56,962
He never corroborated my version.

524
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,673
Sexual?
No, not even a touch.

525
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:03,468
Maybe you scared him by striking her.

526
00:32:03,677 --> 00:32:06,054
No and of what value would that be, scientifically?

527
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:08,974
Doesn't prove anything, she doesn't love me.

528
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:11,810
Who would seriously take the testimony of a pet?

529
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:18,108
Hello.
Hello, this is it.

530
00:32:19,401 --> 00:32:20,735
I acknowledge the theft,

531
00:32:20,944 --> 00:32:23,238
there was a lot of money. But not aggression,

532
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:27,159
It's not true, I did nothing. Security had a vengeance.

533
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:30,120
He wanted to humiliate me in front of all customers.

534
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:31,955
He hit me with a belt.

535
00:32:32,164 --> 00:32:34,499
He inflicted a cut, but the blow is gone.

536
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,918
David comes from a bourgeois family, supposedly.

537
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:39,129
He does not give a damn about money.

538
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:41,840
He has time for purists.

539
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:44,759
For purists?
Yes, it's a luxury anyway.

540
00:32:44,968 --> 00:32:48,054
To be able to play the moralists, it's naive.

541
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:51,391
I made-up bull, I had no choice.

542
00:32:51,725 --> 00:32:53,810
So why does he reveal it all?

543
00:32:55,937 --> 00:32:59,232
He suffers from a lack of of personality. He's a slacker.

544
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:04,070
He is obsessed with the idea that
information must flow.

545
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:07,574
He loves the idea of ​​transparency.

546
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:10,785
He sees himself in righteousness. And I, in evil.

547
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,330
Did you sleep with magistrates?

548
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:14,539
Yes, much earlier though,

549
00:33:14,998 --> 00:33:17,334
I was a little obsessed with sex.

550
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:21,588
I liked this almost regressive state

551
00:33:22,255 --> 00:33:23,715
and self-sterilizing.

552
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:33,892
Would it bother you?

553
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:35,385
No.

554
00:33:36,311 --> 00:33:38,188
Excuse me, I'm a little stressed,

555
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:40,732
I myself have troubles...
As for the blow I am...

556
00:33:40,982 --> 00:33:42,317
Do you mind if you talk about it?

557
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:44,160
No, no...

558
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:46,538
I'm in a situation...that's troublesome.

559
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:50,367
I confided in someone,

560
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:52,927
and now he wants to use it against me.

561
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:55,163
I wonder...

562
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:59,125
do I attack it, out maneuver or crush him?

563
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:01,378
Don't cave in, defend yourself.

564
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:03,046
So do I attack him? Is that it?

565
00:34:03,255 --> 00:34:04,673
Obviously, that's your job.

566
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:07,509
Yes, yes, I know how to do that. Yes.

567
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:13,598
Is everything alright?

568
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:16,643
All good. It's you who is the accused.

569
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:18,186
Excuse me,

570
00:34:18,395 --> 00:34:20,230
I just wanted an external point of view.

571
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:31,783
I love sex.

572
00:34:33,326 --> 00:34:36,121
I feel how you feel, thousand times over.

573
00:34:37,122 --> 00:34:39,040
How do you know how I feel?

574
00:34:39,249 --> 00:34:40,458
I know that's all.

575
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:43,795
I feel everything exponentially.

576
00:34:44,588 --> 00:34:46,506
Have you been sensitive for a long time?

577
00:34:46,715 --> 00:34:47,924
Always.

578
00:34:49,009 --> 00:34:50,427
I learned to live with it.

579
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:53,763
I love myself more than most people love each other.

580
00:34:54,097 --> 00:34:55,599
I work on it every day.

581
00:34:57,684 --> 00:35:00,687
I love myself to give more pleasure to the other.

582
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:06,484
I have a body, I respect it.

583
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:09,195
I don't pretend, I don't cheat.

584
00:35:09,946 --> 00:35:12,741
I embrace the one who spends a few hours with me.

585
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:19,789
Sex isn't a priority, at the moment.

586
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:27,631
I wonder why wallow in with such pleasure,
without asking questions.

587
00:35:28,632 --> 00:35:30,425
Sex, sex, sex. I'm into a short cut.

588
00:35:31,635 --> 00:35:33,303
It's like coming back to...

589
00:35:34,804 --> 00:35:37,140
the state of an infant.

590
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:38,408
Do you understand?

591
00:35:38,516 --> 00:35:42,020
Stop asking me this, otherwise
you will continue on that couch.

592
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:44,105
Suddenly...

593
00:35:44,606 --> 00:35:46,107
I was panic-stricken.

594
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:49,819
Everything I've experienced in the week has re-emerged.

595
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:52,739
And his body seemed heavy on me.

596
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:57,744
So heavy that I had to get rid of him.

597
00:35:57,952 --> 00:35:59,996
As if I had committed a crime and...

598
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:02,749
I had to get rid of him, at once.

599
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,751
I pretended to do something,

600
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:07,629
I went out, he stayed in the room.

601
00:36:08,463 --> 00:36:09,839
And then I panicked.

602
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,731
Sam.

603
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:21,976
What's the matter?

604
00:36:22,394 --> 00:36:24,646
What's going on?

605
00:36:24,854 --> 00:36:26,147
What's the matter?

606
00:36:27,524 --> 00:36:29,317
What's happening?

607
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:33,196
Calm down, everything is fine, breathes calmly. Breathe.

608
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:34,455
OK?

609
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:36,074
I'm going to ask you a few questions.

610
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:37,659
Where are you? Where are you?

611
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:39,202
You hear me?

612
00:36:39,411 --> 00:36:40,829
Have you ever had these attacks?

613
00:36:42,163 --> 00:36:43,223
Did he rape you?

614
00:36:43,873 --> 00:36:45,250
A dangerous position?

615
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:48,712
It's good, I know that, think of something pleasant.

616
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,798
Think of little dwarfs, small rabbits to the sea.

617
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:53,007
Lexo...
Everything is fine.

618
00:36:53,216 --> 00:36:54,801
Shut up.
You want Lexomil?

619
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:56,177
Yes. Where are they?

620
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:00,765
On the book shelf.

621
00:37:00,974 --> 00:37:02,475
In the book shelf? OK.

622
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:06,146
I got them.

623
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:08,523
All right, open your mouth.

624
00:37:09,441 --> 00:37:12,068
Here. Here, swallow it.

625
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:16,072
Here, lie down to circulate blood.

626
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:19,400
Breathe calmly.

627
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:23,079
Here, breath.

628
00:37:23,705 --> 00:37:24,789
Breathe.

629
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,169
OK. Do you feel better?
Yes.

630
00:37:29,544 --> 00:37:30,628
Thank you.

631
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:32,922
Were you a nurse?

632
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:36,885
No, I helped guys who felt sick after crack.

633
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:40,972
I need a vanishing point.
Look at the sky.

634
00:37:41,181 --> 00:37:42,256
Okay?

635
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,118
I need space.

636
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:46,311
You got some space.

637
00:37:46,728 --> 00:37:47,779
Everything is fine.

638
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:49,314
I need to see in front of me.

639
00:37:49,522 --> 00:37:51,483
Everything is fine.
Hope I'm not disturbing you?

640
00:37:51,691 --> 00:37:53,568
Oh no, it's okay, she's better now.

641
00:37:53,777 --> 00:37:54,844
Sorry.

642
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:56,154
Well, I'm leaving.

643
00:37:56,362 --> 00:37:57,947
I'm not sure to go three-way.

644
00:37:58,156 --> 00:37:59,991
That's not what you think.

645
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,868
I look after the children.
Children?

646
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:03,870
Well, it was nice seeing you.

647
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:05,622
I'm leaving.
No stay.

648
00:38:07,373 --> 00:38:08,541
Hey guy!

649
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:11,169
Is he stupid, or what?

650
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:12,754
It's not serious or anything.

651
00:38:14,297 --> 00:38:15,340
Deep breaths.

652
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:18,927
I'm going to bed.

653
00:38:21,095 --> 00:38:23,056
Could you come with me, please?
What?

654
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:24,849
Just two seconds.
Yeah.

655
00:38:25,058 --> 00:38:27,101
In my room.
Yeah, okay.

656
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:28,978
Come.

657
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:34,317
Let's go slow.

658
00:38:36,005 --> 00:38:39,317
(WITHOUT HER BY HARRY NILSSON)

659
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:47,717
* I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there *
* But she never comes *

660
00:38:47,817 --> 00:38:52,987
* And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes *
* And I rise to face another day without her *

661
00:38:55,087 --> 00:39:00,017
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

662
00:39:00,117 --> 00:39:05,017
* It's just no good anymore *
* When you walk through the door of an empty room *

663
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:13,717
* And then you go inside and set a table for one *
* It's no fun when you spend a day without her *

664
00:39:13,817 --> 00:39:16,917
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

665
00:39:17,817 --> 00:39:21,717
* We burst the pretty balloon *
* Took us to the moon *

666
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,017
* Such a beautiful thing *
* But it's ended now *

667
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:31,057
* And it sounds like a lie *
* If I say I'd rather die than live without her *

668
00:39:31,147 --> 00:39:35,047
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *
* Without her, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

669
00:39:35,147 --> 00:39:38,247
Miss Spick, I regret to inform you that you are being
summoned by the 'The Order of Lawyers' for contacting

670
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:40,247
one of the witnesses in the Scorr-Kossarski case.

671
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:42,247
Article 183 of Decree No 91-1197 dated 27 November 1991,
Organization Of Advocate Profession states that:

672
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:44,004
Any contravention of laws and regulations,
any violation of the professional rules, any ...

673
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:47,807
In 12 years of practice,

674
00:39:48,016 --> 00:39:50,351
Victoria Spick has never committed a mistake.

675
00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:52,103
I call into question

676
00:39:52,312 --> 00:39:55,023
the accusation of this woman who sued her.

677
00:39:55,398 --> 00:39:58,318
I would say "pursued to her home",

678
00:39:58,526 --> 00:39:59,652
and even harassed her.

679
00:40:00,028 --> 00:40:03,239
My colleague did not go voluntarily to meet her.

680
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:06,492
She even explained that she could
possibly influence the case.

681
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:10,747
Should she be remanded for addressing that woman,

682
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:13,666
to say that she can't even talk to her?

683
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:14,909
I don't believe that,

684
00:40:14,918 --> 00:40:15,927
Your Honor.

685
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:18,087
Blocking her from this case would have consequences

686
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:19,297
for my colleague.

687
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:23,176
May I state, she has two dependent
children she raises by herself.

688
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:25,053
The father of the children...

689
00:40:25,261 --> 00:40:29,933
a fantastic artist, has not paid her in 7 months.

690
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:31,893
My dear colleagues,

691
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:34,145
do not impose a suspension

692
00:40:34,354 --> 00:40:38,733
that would aggravate her situation
more than it is already.

693
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:44,572
Please.

694
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,162
We have decided to suspend you for 6 months.

695
00:40:51,537 --> 00:40:54,123
Till then, you are not to practice.

696
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:56,876
You knew it yourself, colleague.

697
00:40:57,293 --> 00:41:01,047
It is forbidden to discuss the case with a witness.

698
00:41:01,255 --> 00:41:03,925
You accepted to defend someone you knew,

699
00:41:05,426 --> 00:41:08,012
you should have been more vigilant.

700
00:41:09,806 --> 00:41:11,140
I'm aware this will be hard on you.

701
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:14,894
But I never familiarized my clients or witnesses.

702
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:18,147
One must be very careful!
I don't eat with my client,

703
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:20,775
when on trial in the province.

704
00:41:20,984 --> 00:41:23,987
But I don't dine with a client, or drink.

705
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:27,031
No one has my number, they go through cabinets,

706
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,950
by the Secretary, there is a filter.

707
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,619
If you leave them no power, it's good.

708
00:41:31,828 --> 00:41:35,581
If they understand,
you can stop defending them at any time,

709
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:39,252
the guy will respect you.
We must remain in control of the situation.

710
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,642
You okay?

711
00:42:00,523 --> 00:42:04,193
You look completely groggy. Is that a side effect?

712
00:42:04,402 --> 00:42:06,320
No, the desired effect.

713
00:42:06,863 --> 00:42:09,198
Why don't you stop taking that medication?

714
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:11,242
I need to go down.

715
00:42:12,326 --> 00:42:14,037
I'm here to help.

716
00:42:15,163 --> 00:42:19,292
Sam, you are really great,
thank you very much for everything you done.

717
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:21,085
But I will have more

718
00:42:21,294 --> 00:42:23,254
to talk to you, with what is happening to me.

719
00:42:26,382 --> 00:42:27,675
No, no, but I...

720
00:42:28,301 --> 00:42:29,886
I'd rather you go.

721
00:42:31,471 --> 00:42:33,723
Take away from this and you should rebound.

722
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:35,808
I can still help you on the case.

723
00:42:36,017 --> 00:42:37,393
No, you can't.

724
00:42:37,602 --> 00:42:39,437
Jamal took over the case.

725
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:43,900
I have no control on anything there.

726
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:49,489
But it's good.

727
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,299
You're very nice.

728
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:52,492
I'm not nice.

729
00:42:57,747 --> 00:42:58,873
Victoria, this is Vincent.

730
00:42:59,082 --> 00:43:00,875
I don't know if you spoke to Jamal,

731
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:04,378
in any case, this should be between Eve and me.

732
00:43:04,587 --> 00:43:06,422
He will surely withdraw the complaint.

733
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:10,593
Thank you for what you did.Thank you very much.

734
00:43:11,928 --> 00:43:16,891
Victoria, this is Jamal.
I convinced Eve not to withdraw her complaint,

735
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,311
I explained to her, what she risked doing that.

736
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,147
We'll play it soft so that it ends in dismissal.

737
00:43:23,356 --> 00:43:25,775
Apart from that, they got back together.

738
00:43:25,983 --> 00:43:27,276
Kisses, later.

739
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:32,865
You did a crappy job, Victoria.

740
00:43:33,074 --> 00:43:38,579
You could have gotten into business law,
social law, public law, Real estate law...

741
00:43:38,788 --> 00:43:40,331
Yes, yes, I know my options...

742
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,542
You could have been much more fulfilled.

743
00:43:43,876 --> 00:43:46,629
To blossom, that's a trick for a relative treat.

744
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:51,342
You never made a professional mistake and
then you go talking to a witness.

745
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:53,636
That's the most you did.

746
00:43:53,845 --> 00:43:55,638
I didn't know it would end bad.

747
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:57,974
Sorry, can we talk about this later?

748
00:43:58,516 --> 00:44:00,893
You see, you're passive aggressive.

749
00:44:02,228 --> 00:44:04,313
Your actions speak for themselves.

750
00:44:04,522 --> 00:44:06,399
You're a fake person.

751
00:44:06,941 --> 00:44:10,611
If you had assumed your aggressive side,
you would have lived better.

752
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,490
And you would not have been the victim of the impact,
rather you would have dominated it.

753
00:44:16,576 --> 00:44:18,327
I feel I'm not a victim of the impact.

754
00:44:18,911 --> 00:44:21,747
I feel flexible. I bounced on impact.

755
00:44:22,707 --> 00:44:26,544
Sorry, but I prefer to be an ally than your friend.

756
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:32,175
I love you very much, Victoria, hence my frankness.

757
00:44:36,971 --> 00:44:38,014
What do you see?

758
00:44:39,015 --> 00:44:40,065
It's the same.

759
00:44:40,074 --> 00:44:42,059
Not much.
What do you mean?

760
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:45,271
It's always the same thing, we go around

761
00:44:45,479 --> 00:44:47,273
with the drug history, with you.

762
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:50,401
What do you mean, drug history with me?

763
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:52,236
Why do you still see that?

764
00:44:52,445 --> 00:44:53,988
There's always drugs.

765
00:44:54,197 --> 00:44:57,158
I don't do drugs. There must be some interference.

766
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,718
No, no.

767
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,537
You may see me with an ex-dealer at my house.

768
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:04,540
This isn't at all what you believe, I fired him.

769
00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:08,211
I see...

770
00:45:08,419 --> 00:45:10,379
a professional breakdown.

771
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:11,847
What!?

772
00:45:11,856 --> 00:45:13,966
I don't pay you to tell me what I already know.

773
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:16,260
Tell me about the future, not the past.

774
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:19,138
Normally, I am impressed by your visions,

775
00:45:19,347 --> 00:45:20,381
but this...

776
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:23,142
I'm not a shrink! I say what I see.

777
00:45:24,477 --> 00:45:26,979
I see drugs, I see some malice.

778
00:45:27,188 --> 00:45:29,899
So, is there anything good in those cards?

779
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:32,485
Nothing at all, not even a thin one?

780
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:34,070
Always the same thing?

781
00:45:44,705 --> 00:45:46,874
Your needles have a great effect on me.

782
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:49,919
These aren't needles.

783
00:45:50,127 --> 00:45:51,712
You are thinking nonsense.

784
00:45:52,505 --> 00:45:55,424
Do you talk fantasies with your colleagues?

785
00:45:56,175 --> 00:45:57,293
No.

786
00:45:57,927 --> 00:46:00,137
How's the sex going?

787
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,102
I mainly enjoy in my work.

788
00:46:10,064 --> 00:46:13,776
Pleasure, has nothing to do with enjoyment.

789
00:46:13,985 --> 00:46:15,194
Do we agree?

790
00:46:23,035 --> 00:46:26,122
I did not grasp the nuance...
Finally, I did not understand.

791
00:46:26,706 --> 00:46:29,959
The pleasure you take to your work

792
00:46:30,626 --> 00:46:33,045
has nothing to do with enjoyment.

793
00:46:33,254 --> 00:46:35,006
Do you agree?
Mm

794
00:46:36,382 --> 00:46:38,467
Good.
Probably, yes.

795
00:46:39,385 --> 00:46:40,428
Great.

796
00:46:41,262 --> 00:46:43,097
We've started to close the vacuum.

797
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,519
Where are you? With your friend, Vincent?

798
00:46:52,857 --> 00:46:55,776
We got together, I don't understand.

799
00:46:56,402 --> 00:46:58,070
Whether he did it or not, for that matter,

800
00:46:58,738 --> 00:47:00,197
was completely masochist.

801
00:47:01,073 --> 00:47:03,701
Looks like I've bet on all the bad horses.

802
00:47:04,327 --> 00:47:06,787
Or that the eggs are all in the same basket,

803
00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:08,748
And I am afar from the basket.

804
00:47:17,715 --> 00:47:19,008
I love you.

805
00:50:08,874 --> 00:50:10,474
Six months later...

806
00:50:13,474 --> 00:50:14,808
Hello?
Hi Victoria, this is David.

807
00:50:15,017 --> 00:50:17,061
I have a great announcement to make,

808
00:50:17,269 --> 00:50:19,438
I got the "Tumblr Award for Talent 2016"

809
00:50:19,647 --> 00:50:22,399
for Vicky Spock, I have an important proposal.
I'm restless. Falling apart.

810
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,571
If you'd like to get back together, feel free.

811
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,823
I feel strongly at the moment.

812
00:50:30,032 --> 00:50:33,577
Otherwise I hope you are fine with the girls. Kisses, ciao.

813
00:50:42,127 --> 00:50:44,755
You've reached the answering machine of Samuel and Mal.

814
00:50:45,297 --> 00:50:46,715
Sam, it's Victoria.

815
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:49,134
I'm not very good...

816
00:50:49,343 --> 00:50:50,886
I need to see you.

817
00:50:51,345 --> 00:50:52,346
Excuse me?

818
00:51:13,284 --> 00:51:14,577
It's good to see you.

819
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:15,969
Me too.

820
00:51:20,332 --> 00:51:21,625
Did you change something?

821
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:23,627
Well no.

822
00:51:23,836 --> 00:51:24,837
Change what?

823
00:51:25,337 --> 00:51:26,338
I don't know.

824
00:51:29,383 --> 00:51:30,759
You look good, you look good.

825
00:51:31,135 --> 00:51:33,262
Oh good! Thanks, that's nice.

826
00:51:34,305 --> 00:51:36,015
So, what do you do?

827
00:51:37,308 --> 00:51:40,769
I got into law books and took courses.

828
00:51:42,104 --> 00:51:43,147
This a joke?

829
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,898
Not at all.

830
00:51:46,025 --> 00:51:48,319
You told me to bounce back. I did.

831
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:52,648
And you?

832
00:51:53,198 --> 00:51:54,908
Me, uh...

833
00:51:55,576 --> 00:51:57,244
Every hour weighs a ton.

834
00:51:59,872 --> 00:52:02,124
I've the impression you hit rock bottom.

835
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:04,576
Yeah.

836
00:52:05,127 --> 00:52:07,880
And know that in the abyss, there is nothing.

837
00:52:10,841 --> 00:52:12,134
You missed the girls.

838
00:52:13,052 --> 00:52:14,345
I also missed them.

839
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:22,227
You could come back here, some time,

840
00:52:22,436 --> 00:52:24,480
past, I head out of the water.

841
00:52:24,688 --> 00:52:27,399
OK, let me help you in your job.

842
00:52:28,942 --> 00:52:30,486
When does you suspension end?

843
00:52:30,694 --> 00:52:32,529
It's been over 10 days.

844
00:52:34,948 --> 00:52:37,868
I need work. I can't live like this.

845
00:52:39,787 --> 00:52:41,580
I need to reconnect with community.

846
00:54:34,777 --> 00:54:35,819
You are beautiful.

847
00:54:46,914 --> 00:54:49,583
Victoria, this is Vincent.
Wanted to remind you,

848
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:53,962
One of my ex, Leslie Chevalier,
accuses me of harassment.

849
00:54:55,005 --> 00:54:57,841
I don't know how she knew about the case.

850
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:01,386
She pit Eve against me,
as a result, she is railed.

851
00:55:01,595 --> 00:55:03,972
I know you're mad at me, but call me.

852
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:09,269
This is Jamal,

853
00:55:09,478 --> 00:55:11,355
speaks to Vincent, he fights the doorman,

854
00:55:11,563 --> 00:55:14,316
comes in a bathrobe to my office, he is unmanageable.

855
00:55:15,818 --> 00:55:18,362
I need to know the whole case,

856
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:20,280
why did you send these messages?

857
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:23,116
Leslie treats me like a psychopath without reason.

858
00:55:23,325 --> 00:55:26,620
She was ultra-violent, so I clarified things.

859
00:55:26,829 --> 00:55:30,207
Clarified things?
It's a thin gap between clarification and harassment.

860
00:55:30,415 --> 00:55:32,292
Why did you not tell me?

861
00:55:32,584 --> 00:55:35,254
Might have helped you a little yourself!

862
00:55:35,462 --> 00:55:38,006
Oh, don't take me on a ride with your moral codes.

863
00:55:38,215 --> 00:55:41,343
This is exactly why I need to be defended, not judged.

864
00:55:41,552 --> 00:55:43,136
I left 6 months of hell.

865
00:55:43,345 --> 00:55:44,930
I am the victim,

866
00:55:45,138 --> 00:55:47,808
it was me who got tossed in a cell for 15 days,

867
00:55:48,016 --> 00:55:50,602
while who filed a complaint against me,

868
00:55:50,811 --> 00:55:51,937
loved me 10 days earlier.

869
00:55:52,145 --> 00:55:53,196
Calm down.

870
00:55:53,522 --> 00:55:55,232
You're the only one who can help you.

871
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,442
You will hurt yourself if you're worried.

872
00:55:58,277 --> 00:55:59,695
Vincent must assert himself

873
00:55:59,903 --> 00:56:01,071
as...

874
00:56:02,406 --> 00:56:03,523
a victim.

875
00:56:04,408 --> 00:56:06,201
Thanks Sam, that was very enlightening.

876
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:09,288
I don't think of your relationship with women,

877
00:56:09,496 --> 00:56:11,456
I need to understand things.

878
00:56:11,748 --> 00:56:13,876
And you harass me so I may defend you?

879
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:16,879
Don't talk to me about that,
I'm dangling on a camisole.

880
00:56:17,254 --> 00:56:20,173
Why did you get back with Eve?
It's complicated.

881
00:56:20,382 --> 00:56:22,718
The bullshit, for sure.
Sex, mainly.

882
00:56:22,926 --> 00:56:25,596
I thought it might work, but she wants to be God,

883
00:56:25,804 --> 00:56:26,838
from what I understand.

884
00:56:26,847 --> 00:56:29,725
Jamal is right, you're both crazy.

885
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:31,602
I don't follow you anymore.

886
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,395
Don't judge me, I beg you.

887
00:56:33,604 --> 00:56:34,679
Vincent,

888
00:56:34,688 --> 00:56:36,899
Victoria touched the limits of her profession.

889
00:56:37,107 --> 00:56:39,568
She must learn to separate work and emotions.

890
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:46,541
Promise me,

891
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:47,884
that you will resume your practice.

892
00:56:49,494 --> 00:56:51,163
You know what that means?

893
00:56:51,788 --> 00:56:53,081
That's 15 days!

894
00:57:14,937 --> 00:57:16,730
Looks like you're doing a puzzle.

895
00:57:17,189 --> 00:57:18,440
Let me do it.

896
00:57:18,982 --> 00:57:20,400
Don't underestimate my commitment.

897
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:23,320
I didn't underestimate it, I was just wondering.

898
00:57:31,286 --> 00:57:32,621
Listen, Sam. I...

899
00:57:33,038 --> 00:57:35,332
I think in my head? That...

900
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,876
When I think about what we did the other night,

901
00:57:38,085 --> 00:57:40,712
it was very good. Absolutely.

902
00:57:40,921 --> 00:57:43,715
But, I think it's not good for us to...

903
00:57:44,216 --> 00:57:46,843
'mix' everything together, in our lives,

904
00:57:47,511 --> 00:57:49,179
business and everything.

905
00:57:49,554 --> 00:57:51,014
It's too much to...

906
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,724
Mm.

907
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,404
Come see. Your recidivist, here,

908
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:08,240
Nicolas Santos, has damaged everything in your office.

909
00:58:08,448 --> 00:58:10,117
Everyone is shocked.

910
00:58:10,325 --> 00:58:12,786
Look, he tossed your files in the air,

911
00:58:12,995 --> 00:58:14,579
he threw the table, smashed it up!

912
00:58:14,788 --> 00:58:16,915
Smashed the chairs.

913
00:58:17,124 --> 00:58:19,418
There's more to it than buying them.

914
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:22,295
Look, everything is damaged.
That's the only patch

915
00:58:22,504 --> 00:58:25,048
I was able to save!
That guy was in some state!

916
00:58:25,257 --> 00:58:26,842
What did he want?

917
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:28,844
I don't know! He was furious you weren't here,

918
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:34,057
I was here! Fuck, I'm going to smash her, that fat whore,

919
00:58:34,266 --> 00:58:35,976
She let my life on the Internet.

920
00:58:36,435 --> 00:58:38,520
There! That's the other con with his blog.

921
00:58:38,729 --> 00:58:45,068
Well, I called the cops, they will mobilize
someone in close proximity, just in case.

922
00:58:45,694 --> 00:58:48,447
Do you think that would be useful?
He's not that dangerous.

923
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:51,366
Be polite, and not asshole.

924
00:58:51,575 --> 00:58:54,536
It could be annoying. Be the cool guy.

925
00:58:54,745 --> 00:58:56,830
Since you have neither have a wife or child,

926
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:00,333
we'll put everything on your case.
You're unemployed...

927
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:02,794
but an unemployed researcher.

928
00:59:03,003 --> 00:59:04,079
OK.

929
00:59:04,188 --> 00:59:06,965
They must feel that you have a healthy life,

930
00:59:07,174 --> 00:59:08,508
with responsibilities,

931
00:59:08,717 --> 00:59:11,053
professional.
I am unstable.

932
00:59:14,181 --> 00:59:16,850
Know that you always start with disgust.

933
00:59:17,059 --> 00:59:18,151
What do you mean?

934
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,770
Some avoid the dumplings,

935
00:59:19,978 --> 00:59:22,272
you go into it. You face the disorderly.

936
00:59:22,481 --> 00:59:25,275
And in your case, it would be Leslie Chevalier.

937
00:59:25,942 --> 00:59:28,111
OK. How do I dress?

938
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,822
Not too chic. They would see a strategy.

939
00:59:31,823 --> 00:59:34,451
Is it okay?
Yes, I am fine. No, I'm afraid.

940
00:59:34,659 --> 00:59:37,287
Say that your strength is your mind.

941
00:59:38,205 --> 00:59:39,873
Is this a joke?
No.

942
00:59:40,207 --> 00:59:41,324
For two reasons:

943
00:59:41,333 --> 00:59:43,668
They wouldn't believe a nice guy would want to kill,

944
00:59:43,877 --> 00:59:46,463
and statistically good looking ones
win more than the ugly.

945
00:59:46,671 --> 00:59:50,884
And they are also more indulgent
with an intelligent guy.

946
00:59:51,093 --> 00:59:52,135
They would identify with the same.

947
00:59:52,344 --> 00:59:54,638
Don't hesitate to come out of words...

948
00:59:55,013 --> 00:59:57,182
visible, ostensible.

949
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,684
Obviously, incontestable.

950
00:59:59,893 --> 01:00:01,269
Yes, assured.

951
01:00:10,821 --> 01:00:12,405
Are you going to follow me everywhere?

952
01:00:12,614 --> 01:00:13,698
Yes, everywhere.

953
01:00:13,907 --> 01:00:15,700
Finally, it's time for work.

954
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:20,664
But I know how to keep a certain distance

955
01:00:20,872 --> 01:00:22,582
while ensuring your protection.

956
01:00:24,042 --> 01:00:25,101
OK.

957
01:00:27,254 --> 01:00:31,007
You tricked me, I will destroy you psyche.

958
01:00:31,216 --> 01:00:34,136
You will die by yourself on the inside.

959
01:00:34,344 --> 01:00:36,513
You're a human waste in this cosmos.

960
01:00:36,721 --> 01:00:39,224
Your cowardice left me an indelible trace,

961
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:40,642
I will be angry with you for life.

962
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:45,939
Or, remind me, my love,
you don't see how I suffer, it's inhumane.

963
01:00:46,148 --> 01:00:47,182
Or...

964
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,776
You big pile of shit, you will swallow your arrogance.

965
01:00:49,985 --> 01:00:52,946
Sociopath shit, reality will blow you up.

966
01:00:53,155 --> 01:00:54,906
I dreamed I was taking your head

967
01:00:55,115 --> 01:00:56,867
to smash it against a wall.

968
01:00:57,075 --> 01:00:59,703
Again, I dream of skinning you alive, in bits,

969
01:00:59,911 --> 01:01:03,665
very slowly, with a Swiss knife.
The joy in thinking of you,

970
01:01:03,874 --> 01:01:07,002
your deeds, I weep for you.
Finally peace, I love you

971
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:08,795
and still shit on your grave.

972
01:01:09,004 --> 01:01:12,299
I don't have time to continue to
read this collection of poetry.

973
01:01:12,924 --> 01:01:16,178
Miss Chevalier, explain to us
the context of these emails.

974
01:01:16,386 --> 01:01:19,723
Yes, I lived 6 months with Vincent, in 2008,

975
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:24,477
He was someone perfect, until I decided to breakup.

976
01:01:24,686 --> 01:01:27,522
He became violent, he did not accept my decision.

977
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:31,193
I fled for months, I was afraid of him.

978
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:33,603
Miss Spick?

979
01:01:35,155 --> 01:01:36,448
You speak of violence.

980
01:01:37,324 --> 01:01:39,284
Did he physically assault you?

981
01:01:40,035 --> 01:01:41,077
He tried.

982
01:01:41,174 --> 01:01:43,997
But I managed to escape.

983
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:46,875
He sexually assaulted you?
No.

984
01:01:46,975 --> 01:01:50,587
Why wait so long to report it?

985
01:01:50,795 --> 01:01:52,631
I recognized myself in her.

986
01:01:52,839 --> 01:01:54,382
That it should not happen again.

987
01:01:54,841 --> 01:01:58,970
Did you experience violence from other partners?

988
01:02:00,013 --> 01:02:05,560
Don't you have several complaints filed
against five of them for similar acts?

989
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:07,870
Yes.

990
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:10,357
And yet you did not you come forward
on three of them with your testimonials?

991
01:02:10,941 --> 01:02:13,318
That has nothing to do with this! Vincent was violent.

992
01:02:13,902 --> 01:02:16,738
I may read my testimony.
You may? Very good.

993
01:02:17,113 --> 01:02:18,490
I have no further questions.

994
01:02:18,823 --> 01:02:20,700
I greatly respect Miss Spick,

995
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:22,661
but I like the idea of ​​transparency.

996
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:24,371
I am on the side of justice,

997
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:28,583
that's why that I did not ask for a lawyer.

998
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:31,461
This would have created a barrier
between myself and my defense.

999
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:33,129
Thank you, Mr.Gonzalez.

1000
01:02:35,924 --> 01:02:37,968
Mr.Mazetti.
Miss Scorr,

1001
01:02:38,176 --> 01:02:40,637
Did he snatch your panties violently?

1002
01:02:40,845 --> 01:02:42,180
Yes, very violently.

1003
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:45,892
He rushed at me.

1004
01:02:47,394 --> 01:02:50,355
I was frightened, under those conditions.

1005
01:02:50,563 --> 01:02:52,107
What happened to your panties?

1006
01:02:52,315 --> 01:02:54,150
Maybe he kept it.

1007
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:57,821
I never saw her panties. She did not wear them.
Quiet!

1008
01:02:58,321 --> 01:02:59,656
Quiet please!

1009
01:02:59,864 --> 01:03:00,949
I couldn't have done anything,

1010
01:03:01,157 --> 01:03:04,035
had Victoria respected the confidentiality clause.

1011
01:03:04,244 --> 01:03:06,079
With regards to the blog, that is an auto-fiction.

1012
01:03:06,288 --> 01:03:10,375
I mixed elements of my personal life
with imagination, fantasy.

1013
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:11,835
The problem is that, Mr.Gonzales,

1014
01:03:12,043 --> 01:03:15,547
your heroine bears the same name as my client.

1015
01:03:16,173 --> 01:03:18,925
She is a lawyer, like my client.

1016
01:03:19,134 --> 01:03:21,177
You talk about clients who exist

1017
01:03:21,386 --> 01:03:27,309
in her life, who she defended.
And worse, you talk of an liaison with a magistrate.

1018
01:03:27,517 --> 01:03:31,646
This constitutes to my client a similarity

1019
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:35,608
and you tell us, you mix truth and fantasy etc?

1020
01:03:35,817 --> 01:03:40,196
But the reader, is unable to
totally comprehend all this.

1021
01:03:40,405 --> 01:03:42,198
So! What will the reader believe in?

1022
01:03:42,407 --> 01:03:44,784
He will believe in the worst,
the most seedy...

1023
01:03:44,993 --> 01:03:48,413
that my client had sexual relations with judges.

1024
01:03:49,122 --> 01:03:52,625
So you mess up her reputation, her work,

1025
01:03:52,834 --> 01:03:56,004
her credibility and you splash the whole profession

1026
01:03:56,212 --> 01:03:59,716
with your infamous remarks, and that,
Your honor, is intolerable.

1027
01:03:59,924 --> 01:04:03,178
Your Honor, I see the deceit in
the remarks made by the Counsel,

1028
01:04:03,386 --> 01:04:05,680
I trust the intellect of the readers.

1029
01:04:06,431 --> 01:04:07,974
And speaking of literature,

1030
01:04:08,183 --> 01:04:11,269
I quote Flaubert, who said, "I am Madame Bovary".

1031
01:04:11,478 --> 01:04:14,189
Well I would say, "I'm Vicky Spock".

1032
01:04:14,647 --> 01:04:17,025
Unfortunately, you are Mr.Gonzalez

1033
01:04:17,233 --> 01:04:18,693
and you have no imagination.

1034
01:04:19,402 --> 01:04:20,487
That was for you.

1035
01:04:20,695 --> 01:04:21,763
I was designated

1036
01:04:21,771 --> 01:04:24,824
a whore while sexually, it isn't sexual.

1037
01:04:25,033 --> 01:04:27,786
Then Why did this client destroy your office?

1038
01:04:27,994 --> 01:04:32,415
He thinks I slept with the judge
who sentenced him, it was anything but.

1039
01:04:32,624 --> 01:04:34,125
He felt thoroughly betrayed.

1040
01:04:34,584 --> 01:04:38,004
You could have slept with the judge to help your client?

1041
01:04:38,296 --> 01:04:41,549
No, I was wrong, but not at that point.

1042
01:04:42,425 --> 01:04:46,096
But you were fairly well to sleep with a judge, out of envy.

1043
01:04:46,304 --> 01:04:47,430
Yes, yes.

1044
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:50,183
I laid with desire, not by calculation.

1045
01:04:53,061 --> 01:04:54,479
In a sense, I think that

1046
01:04:54,687 --> 01:04:55,688
you would be flattered.

1047
01:04:55,897 --> 01:04:56,898
Flattered?

1048
01:04:57,107 --> 01:04:58,316
Yes, he writes about your life.

1049
01:04:58,525 --> 01:05:02,445
Which means somewhere, there's interest and admiration.

1050
01:05:02,654 --> 01:05:06,408
He don't write about something
which does not interest readers.

1051
01:05:06,616 --> 01:05:07,909
It's almost a statement.

1052
01:05:09,828 --> 01:05:11,079
You kidding?

1053
01:05:11,663 --> 01:05:12,714
Nevertheless,

1054
01:05:12,722 --> 01:05:15,083
be fascinated to someone for having written that.

1055
01:05:15,291 --> 01:05:16,918
Be it looting, stealing...

1056
01:05:17,335 --> 01:05:20,213
Usually, people send others shabby text.

1057
01:05:20,547 --> 01:05:23,091
He transformed your failure in a sublime trick.

1058
01:05:27,262 --> 01:05:30,306
Yes, yes. It's beautiful just
as you believe in humanity.

1059
01:05:34,302 --> 01:05:37,355
Eve, pet the dog.
Miss Scorr, for BFM TV.

1060
01:05:37,564 --> 01:05:39,899
What...? No comments.

1061
01:05:40,108 --> 01:05:41,985
Please, Miss Scorr.

1062
01:05:42,193 --> 01:05:44,571
When the animal finds itself confronting a person

1063
01:05:44,779 --> 01:05:46,239
who hurt his owner,

1064
01:05:46,448 --> 01:05:50,034
it has a backward reaction, out of fear. It is a body language.

1065
01:05:50,368 --> 01:05:57,417
A set of fairly readable signals, the look,
finally the position of the eyes, ears, body,

1066
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:59,419
The tail, is very important.

1067
01:05:59,627 --> 01:06:01,963
The study wag clearly shows a stressed dog,

1068
01:06:02,172 --> 01:06:05,008
the frightened will wag the tail towards the left,

1069
01:06:05,383 --> 01:06:09,095
while a confident and happy dog
will wag to the right.

1070
01:06:09,304 --> 01:06:12,807
What did you observe from the tests on the dog?

1071
01:06:13,016 --> 01:06:14,809
Yes! I'm starting the video.

1072
01:06:15,685 --> 01:06:16,752
Here,

1073
01:06:16,761 --> 01:06:20,273
in the first test, when one presents the dog, Jacques,

1074
01:06:20,482 --> 01:06:24,152
a lambda shirt, it wags the tail to the right.

1075
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,613
While in the second test,

1076
01:06:26,821 --> 01:06:31,075
when presented with a shirt of the accused,
it acts differently.

1077
01:06:31,284 --> 01:06:34,037
It seems worried and wags the tail to the left.

1078
01:06:34,454 --> 01:06:37,207
This is a statistical study,

1079
01:06:37,415 --> 01:06:39,834
It is an approximation.
Mr.Mazetti?

1080
01:06:40,043 --> 01:06:42,212
Defense has no comment.
Miss Spick?

1081
01:06:42,629 --> 01:06:44,923
How long have you been practicing

1082
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:47,592
your profession as an expert on justice?

1083
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,851
11 years.

1084
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:49,936
Very good.

1085
01:06:49,944 --> 01:06:53,515
During these 11 years,
have you come across cases of possessive dogs?

1086
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:57,977
Can you confirm that the animals

1087
01:06:58,186 --> 01:06:59,771
may have be dissatisfied

1088
01:06:59,979 --> 01:07:02,190
if their masters had not a tender relationship?

1089
01:07:02,857 --> 01:07:04,734
Yes, I do.

1090
01:07:05,485 --> 01:07:08,863
It can therefore react negatively
to the presence of the accused,

1091
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,615
not because it had

1092
01:07:10,823 --> 01:07:14,077
aggression towards the victim, but due to

1093
01:07:14,285 --> 01:07:15,995
tenderness or sexual issues?

1094
01:07:16,204 --> 01:07:17,497
It's not that simple.

1095
01:07:17,705 --> 01:07:18,748
Answer "yes" or "no".

1096
01:07:19,415 --> 01:07:20,575
So...yes.

1097
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:22,669
Very good. I have no further questions.

1098
01:07:23,086 --> 01:07:25,296
Good, bring in the dog, please.

1099
01:07:26,047 --> 01:07:28,258
Given the exceptional nature of his testimony,

1100
01:07:28,466 --> 01:07:31,678
I ask you not to laugh or make sudden gestures.

1101
01:07:31,886 --> 01:07:35,974
Mr.Verban, will interpret what the dog expresses.

1102
01:07:36,683 --> 01:07:37,892
Miss Scorr,

1103
01:07:38,518 --> 01:07:41,329
if you could get closer to the dog.

1104
01:07:41,729 --> 01:07:44,607
And stand straight before him, for a moment.

1105
01:07:53,575 --> 01:08:02,584
Good. Mr.Kossarski, approach and touch
Miss Scorr's arm for example.

1106
01:08:16,681 --> 01:08:18,224
Counsel, anything to add?

1107
01:08:18,433 --> 01:08:20,310
May I come forward?
Yes.

1108
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,495
Thank you.

1109
01:08:36,409 --> 01:08:37,476
Please.

1110
01:08:37,702 --> 01:08:38,786
Mr.Verban?

1111
01:08:39,287 --> 01:08:42,707
The animal seems very disturbed.

1112
01:08:47,837 --> 01:08:53,343
He was born at a Buddhist sect which made him,
misanthropic by the age of 13,

1113
01:08:54,427 --> 01:08:57,305
The mystery remained as to the possibility

1114
01:08:57,513 --> 01:09:00,099
that this community advocating serenity

1115
01:09:00,308 --> 01:09:03,186
could have nurtured a tortured mind, hysterical,

1116
01:09:03,394 --> 01:09:05,647
an Apostle of liberalism than his own.

1117
01:09:05,855 --> 01:09:08,983
It left traces in her relation to men.

1118
01:09:09,192 --> 01:09:12,070
She had an especially sexual cerebral,

1119
01:09:12,278 --> 01:09:14,447
a simple vision of a beautiful pleading.

1120
01:09:14,656 --> 01:09:18,910
An avocado sown could make her happy at once.

1121
01:09:20,536 --> 01:09:22,080
I felt useless,

1122
01:09:22,288 --> 01:09:27,085
She had become a potential monster,
a being totally devoid of emotions.

1123
01:09:27,293 --> 01:09:30,463
Her existence than to his desire for mastery.

1124
01:09:30,672 --> 01:09:31,881
Before this phallic woman,

1125
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:34,384
I was invisible, but I recorded everything.

1126
01:09:34,592 --> 01:09:35,968
Mr.Gonzalez.

1127
01:09:37,804 --> 01:09:39,897
What are you looking for us believe?

1128
01:09:39,906 --> 01:09:42,642
That this is a novel of pure imagination?

1129
01:09:43,434 --> 01:09:46,437
If I may assert the opposite,
I shall be accused of slander.

1130
01:09:46,646 --> 01:09:48,940
I, therefore reply this is fiction.

1131
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:50,358
OK, it's fiction.

1132
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,486
The portrait you make of your heroine

1133
01:09:53,695 --> 01:09:54,862
is of a prospective character.

1134
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:57,323
Yes, but that's the freedom of the novelist.

1135
01:09:57,949 --> 01:09:59,867
Who would believe that you didn't

1136
01:10:00,076 --> 01:10:02,870
knowingly include objective elements

1137
01:10:03,079 --> 01:10:05,748
for everyone to realize the fiction in hindsight,

1138
01:10:05,957 --> 01:10:07,917
the defamatory portrayal of Miss Spick?

1139
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:14,048
I have a virile sexuality?

1140
01:10:15,216 --> 01:10:18,136
No. It's not like we had practiced a lot.

1141
01:10:21,597 --> 01:10:23,766
Am I a cold monster and calculator?

1142
01:10:25,017 --> 01:10:28,312
Everyone is a little bit.
No not You. You, you...

1143
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:31,149
not malicious. You're a good person.

1144
01:10:31,357 --> 01:10:32,442
Not at all.

1145
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:35,069
You're wrong, I'm not a good person.

1146
01:10:35,278 --> 01:10:38,030
I own nothing, maybe that's what makes me

1147
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:39,949
sympathetic or harmless.

1148
01:10:40,324 --> 01:10:44,120
I don't appreciate you for these reasons,
that's not what I feel.

1149
01:10:45,037 --> 01:10:47,457
It isn't because I feel superior to you.

1150
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,560
I don't know.

1151
01:10:51,377 --> 01:10:53,004
Even if that were the case,

1152
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:54,272
it is always that.

1153
01:10:55,006 --> 01:10:56,632
I appreciate you for your...

1154
01:10:57,091 --> 01:10:58,760
human qualities.

1155
01:11:03,181 --> 01:11:05,975
You represent an area of non-danger for me.

1156
01:11:06,184 --> 01:11:07,727
You have become a priority.

1157
01:11:09,854 --> 01:11:11,856
I don't know how I should take it.

1158
01:11:12,565 --> 01:11:13,624
Good.

1159
01:11:31,014 --> 01:11:32,124
Nantes: Witness has 4 legs

1160
01:11:32,224 --> 01:11:35,924
Never seen before in the court of Nantes.
A dog witness to an attempted murder...by Estelle Comillac

1161
01:11:36,024 --> 01:11:38,024
Canine trial to the limit of it's power.

1162
01:11:40,301 --> 01:11:42,053
Bring in Daisy and her handler, please.

1163
01:11:46,432 --> 01:11:47,491
Come here.

1164
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,976
This trial is turning out to be ridiculous.

1165
01:11:49,185 --> 01:11:51,604
Mr.Mazetti, I would ask you to remain silent.

1166
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:55,191
Monsieur.
Hello.

1167
01:11:56,984 --> 01:11:59,237
Are you related or an allied party?

1168
01:11:59,445 --> 01:12:01,280
I am a friend of the bride.

1169
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:03,199
Do you have a statement to make?

1170
01:12:03,407 --> 01:12:05,076
No.
Miss Spick?

1171
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:06,276
Yes.

1172
01:12:07,745 --> 01:12:08,913
Mr Kleinberg,

1173
01:12:09,288 --> 01:12:12,500
do you rent your monkey for tricks, is that correct?

1174
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:13,768
Yes, that's right.

1175
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:18,047
What were you doing at the wedding?
We had to put up a small number,

1176
01:12:18,256 --> 01:12:19,715
so we came up to do that.

1177
01:12:20,132 --> 01:12:21,759
And after the show?

1178
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:24,846
We stayed up, until 3:00 in the morning.

1179
01:12:25,304 --> 01:12:27,014
And what did you do with Daisy?

1180
01:12:27,431 --> 01:12:29,851
She was with me, she was in the mood,

1181
01:12:30,059 --> 01:12:32,436
so we danced and she took pictures.

1182
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:33,938
She took pictures?
Yes.

1183
01:12:34,522 --> 01:12:36,148
Can you show us the pictures?
Yes.

1184
01:12:37,275 --> 01:12:38,526
We'll take a picture? OK?

1185
01:12:39,235 --> 01:12:40,987
Here. With the finger.

1186
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:42,405
Like I showed you.

1187
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:49,161
Just like that.

1188
01:12:51,414 --> 01:12:52,623
Please!

1189
01:12:56,002 --> 01:12:57,712
Here, like that. Go ahead.

1190
01:12:58,546 --> 01:12:59,605
Photo.

1191
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:03,301
What did you do with the pictures taken?

1192
01:13:03,509 --> 01:13:05,511
I have...Ah no, no.

1193
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,179
Silence!
Stay here.

1194
01:13:07,972 --> 01:13:11,017
I transferred them on to my computer.
Good. Thank you.

1195
01:13:12,727 --> 01:13:13,978
Continue, Counsel.
Yes.

1196
01:13:16,355 --> 01:13:18,900
Look at these images taken during the marriage.

1197
01:13:19,108 --> 01:13:22,820
These are people who danced on the track with desserts

1198
01:13:23,029 --> 01:13:25,364
served an hour before the event.

1199
01:13:25,573 --> 01:13:27,575
On your left, recognizable in her dress,

1200
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:30,870
Eve Scorr dancing back and forth.
Zooming in,

1201
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:34,874
we see details appearing, thanks to the flash.

1202
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:38,836
We see transparently that Miss Scorr
isn't wearing any panties.

1203
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:40,546
Now, Miss Scorr says that

1204
01:13:40,755 --> 01:13:42,465
her panties were snatched from her.

1205
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:44,884
Therein lies 3 possibilities:

1206
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:46,594
Either my client snatched

1207
01:13:46,802 --> 01:13:49,096
her panties an hour before the event.

1208
01:13:49,305 --> 01:13:50,348
Miss Scorr

1209
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:53,267
handed over panties between 1:00 AM and 2:00 AM

1210
01:13:53,476 --> 01:13:56,020
for an impossible reason to imagine

1211
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,230
which does not figure on her testimony.

1212
01:13:58,439 --> 01:14:01,734
Or perhaps, or perhaps, simply lied.

1213
01:14:01,858 --> 01:14:04,428
(DAT DERE BY TONY BENNETT)

1214
01:14:04,528 --> 01:14:08,516
* Daddy! Hey daddy!

1215
01:14:08,616 --> 01:14:09,717
Miss Spick.

1216
01:14:10,326 --> 01:14:11,994
Could we get a picture, please.

1217
01:14:12,094 --> 01:14:13,312
* What's that there? *

1218
01:14:13,412 --> 01:14:14,789
A photo with the monkey.

1219
01:14:16,899 --> 01:14:20,999
* Hey daddy, that's him *
* Hey look at that over there! *

1220
01:14:21,099 --> 01:14:23,999
* Daddy O hey, daddy O ho *
* Look over there! *

1221
01:14:25,099 --> 01:14:28,029
* Hey why they go in there? *
* And what they doing there? *

1222
01:14:28,129 --> 01:14:31,029
* And daddy can I have that big elephant over there? *

1223
01:14:32,129 --> 01:14:35,029
* And who's that in my chair? *
* And what's she doing there?

1224
01:14:35,129 --> 01:14:37,929
* Daddy, O hey, can I go over there? *

1225
01:14:38,029 --> 01:14:42,216
* Hey daddy, what's a square? *
* And where do we get air? *

1226
01:14:42,316 --> 01:14:43,324
Hello.

1227
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:45,412
* And daddy can I have that big elephant over there? *

1228
01:14:46,362 --> 01:14:49,240
Damn, the computer! I damaged it.

1229
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:50,450
You did?

1230
01:14:52,368 --> 01:14:53,577
Are you fine?

1231
01:14:53,786 --> 01:14:55,496
No, I'm not, actually...

1232
01:14:55,705 --> 01:14:59,583
Wait, I'll open door and come back listen to you.

1233
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:02,770
What are you doing here?

1234
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:05,256
I have ideas to improve my character.

1235
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:06,966
What are you talking about?

1236
01:15:07,174 --> 01:15:09,427
I feel completely useless.

1237
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:12,930
You have nothing to do with that, that's my job.

1238
01:15:13,139 --> 01:15:15,850
Vincent, don't change your attitude facing the jury.

1239
01:15:17,101 --> 01:15:19,228
You have a bodyguard now?

1240
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:23,399
What is it?
Sorry, I met him in the street.

1241
01:15:23,607 --> 01:15:25,109
OK, that's okay.

1242
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:27,570
What's the matter?

1243
01:15:27,862 --> 01:15:28,921
Oh, Vincent!

1244
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:30,448
I'm having a panic attack.

1245
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:32,616
No! Everything will be alright.

1246
01:15:32,825 --> 01:15:34,660
Statistically, it is proven,

1247
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:37,538
that if you survive a crash,
you will not get through another crash.

1248
01:15:37,747 --> 01:15:39,081
Mom!
Two seconds!

1249
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:42,084
It's going to be fine, just get some rest. OK?

1250
01:15:42,752 --> 01:15:44,503
Sam, I'm going with him to talk.

1251
01:15:45,463 --> 01:15:46,538
Come on.

1252
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:47,706
It will be fine.

1253
01:15:47,715 --> 01:15:49,592
Victoria, my life is completely...

1254
01:15:50,885 --> 01:15:52,970
I'll take rest tomorrow.
What?

1255
01:15:53,721 --> 01:15:54,972
I have become more invisible.

1256
01:15:55,181 --> 01:15:56,248
I exist more.

1257
01:15:56,265 --> 01:15:57,332
I dream...

1258
01:15:57,341 --> 01:15:58,400
Are you taking notes?

1259
01:15:58,492 --> 01:15:59,769
No, I'm writing a text message.

1260
01:15:59,977 --> 01:16:01,479
No this is not possible.

1261
01:16:03,606 --> 01:16:05,983
Étienne, can you get him out of here?

1262
01:16:06,192 --> 01:16:07,251
Thank you.
Out now, Monsieur.

1263
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:09,361
There you see your true face.

1264
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:10,780
I don't count on you.

1265
01:16:10,988 --> 01:16:14,100
No! Don't underestimate yourself.

1266
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,745
I don't underestimate myself,
I am leaving because I have esteem.

1267
01:16:18,954 --> 01:16:21,957
I have known you all your life,
and you, you know nothing about me.

1268
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:24,376
You don't know why I wanted to live here.

1269
01:16:25,461 --> 01:16:28,547
Yes Yes. Of course yes.
Well no.

1270
01:16:28,756 --> 01:16:30,883
I did all this to save me from my life.

1271
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:33,219
Good...in English.

1272
01:16:33,427 --> 01:16:35,554
Listen.
English? When I...

1273
01:16:35,763 --> 01:16:37,807
arrived here, I realized that...

1274
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,600
I liked you more than I was thinking

1275
01:16:39,809 --> 01:16:41,185
And it surprised me.

1276
01:16:41,644 --> 01:16:43,020
I like you very much.

1277
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:46,482
Even when you "tremble" on the floor "in drool",

1278
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:50,152
when you slept with all these guys in night, I like you.

1279
01:16:50,528 --> 01:16:51,612
But I was thinking "that"...

1280
01:16:51,821 --> 01:16:53,697
that the situation would change.

1281
01:16:54,198 --> 01:16:55,741
I was thinking "that"...

1282
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:57,910
you will give me a...

1283
01:16:58,119 --> 01:17:01,122
a better place in your life, in your work...

1284
01:17:02,623 --> 01:17:03,916
And in fact, nothing at all.

1285
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:09,338
You've enjoyed it without realizing it.

1286
01:17:09,547 --> 01:17:11,257
You're the one who underestimates yourself.

1287
01:17:11,465 --> 01:17:12,550
I stole money from you.

1288
01:17:12,967 --> 01:17:15,678
What?
I stole a bit, at first,

1289
01:17:15,886 --> 01:17:19,431
I found it moving that you trusted me, confided in me.

1290
01:17:20,266 --> 01:17:23,185
You would've never known had I had not told you,

1291
01:17:23,394 --> 01:17:26,021
and you would've never known I exist, had I not left.

1292
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:28,816
No, Sam! Don't go. Not on the day before my pleading.

1293
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:30,359
Sam?
I will not change my mind.

1294
01:17:30,568 --> 01:17:32,444
Please stay.
No.

1295
01:17:36,574 --> 01:17:37,658
Is everything all right, ma'am?

1296
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:40,744
Do you need help?

1297
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:46,417
Yes, you may enter. I don't feel very well.

1298
01:17:59,471 --> 01:18:02,391
Can you stay tonight? I don't feel assured.

1299
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,893
Okay.
Thank you very much.

1300
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:06,103
I'll install the sofa bed.

1301
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:08,472
Girls, we are going to sleep.

1302
01:18:11,609 --> 01:18:14,320
Can I use your shower?
Yes, it's over there.

1303
01:18:14,612 --> 01:18:15,613
Okay.

1304
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:55,736
Where is she?
In the bedroom.

1305
01:19:02,034 --> 01:19:03,244
What did you do?

1306
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:05,162
Let's take her to the bathroom.

1307
01:19:21,095 --> 01:19:22,388
How much did you take?

1308
01:19:22,846 --> 01:19:24,807
I don't know, a few of them.

1309
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:27,601
It was to sleep, but...

1310
01:19:29,353 --> 01:19:31,230
Good, mademoiselle, you are young,

1311
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:34,191
You have a whole life in front of you.

1312
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,068
Don't let go like that.

1313
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:38,862
Drink lots of water and rest.

1314
01:19:39,071 --> 01:19:40,990
Your body will recover slowly.

1315
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:42,783
Thank you, how much do you owe?

1316
01:19:42,992 --> 01:19:44,118
€47, please.

1317
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:48,122
Contractually, I'm done with work, but I could stay.

1318
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:51,583
No, it's good, thank you very much.
Thanks for everything, Étienne.

1319
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:54,837
You helped us. Thank you very much. Goodbye.

1320
01:19:55,838 --> 01:19:57,214
Quick, we're in a hurry.

1321
01:19:59,174 --> 01:20:01,510
I can't go.
Get up.

1322
01:20:01,719 --> 01:20:02,728
I...

1323
01:20:02,736 --> 01:20:05,222
Will call...
You will have to go plead on all fours.

1324
01:20:07,016 --> 01:20:08,434
Take some sugar.

1325
01:20:08,642 --> 01:20:10,477
I will not plead sitting.

1326
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:11,778
I'm very good,

1327
01:20:11,787 --> 01:20:13,897
You are a force of nature.
No, your aren't a force of nature.

1328
01:20:14,106 --> 01:20:15,399
Did you see my eyes?

1329
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:18,152
They are beautiful. We'll put on some makeup.
I can't do this.

1330
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:21,947
Get up and get dressed.

1331
01:20:22,156 --> 01:20:24,783
Please don't argue with me.
Stop, come on.

1332
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:27,369
You are going.
Slowly. I am going to vomit.

1333
01:20:27,578 --> 01:20:28,871
We'll vomit together.

1334
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:35,878
You wouldn't have a thing, amphetamines,
a trick for...?

1335
01:20:36,545 --> 01:20:38,422
Are you crazy?
It's for work.

1336
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:41,708
Good.

1337
01:20:44,428 --> 01:20:45,804
I'll be replaced...

1338
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:47,890
This is for your once a lifetime plead.

1339
01:20:50,059 --> 01:20:51,101
Here, inhale.

1340
01:20:53,604 --> 01:20:54,646
Again.

1341
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:57,849
Are we good?

1342
01:21:23,801 --> 01:21:25,135
You frighten me, Victoria.
No...

1343
01:21:26,387 --> 01:21:29,139
Deep down, I believe in you.

1344
01:21:32,226 --> 01:21:33,227
Why is he there?

1345
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:35,295
Why?

1346
01:21:35,354 --> 01:21:36,397
Why are you here?

1347
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:40,526
I saved her life for the girl
who will try to save yours.

1348
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:43,195
Basically, I saved your life. So fuck you.

1349
01:21:48,951 --> 01:21:50,327
How's Victoria doing?
Yes.

1350
01:21:50,536 --> 01:21:52,496
Leave me alone for half hour.

1351
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,256
OK?

1352
01:22:57,769 --> 01:22:59,396
Miss.Spick, your turn to speak.

1353
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:13,494
Could a dog be heard as a witness?

1354
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:16,038
The question was raised, today,

1355
01:23:16,246 --> 01:23:18,999
in a case of attempted murder.

1356
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:24,129
I ask you to be vigilant to these experiments.

1357
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:33,931
I would like to add

1358
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:36,016
that the intelligence of a dog

1359
01:23:36,642 --> 01:23:38,810
is 51% genetic.

1360
01:23:39,269 --> 01:23:42,606
And that according to the top dog breeds,

1361
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:46,276
the dalmatian ranks at the bottom of the list,

1362
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:48,487
behind the poodle,

1363
01:23:49,696 --> 01:23:50,906
the Doberman,

1364
01:23:52,324 --> 01:23:55,202
the German Shepherd and about thirty other breeds.

1365
01:24:19,726 --> 01:24:20,936
In other words,

1366
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:22,512
If we

1367
01:24:22,521 --> 01:24:24,606
were to trust the word of a dog,

1368
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:29,945
the dalmatian isn't the brightest to
communicate something to us.

1369
01:25:00,934 --> 01:25:02,060
How can we...

1370
01:25:04,187 --> 01:25:05,397
how can we

1371
01:25:06,398 --> 01:25:09,401
accuse someone of attempted murder?

1372
01:25:16,074 --> 01:25:17,284
How can we...

1373
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:23,165
And getting back to him...

1374
01:25:26,627 --> 01:25:28,086
He's my client.

1375
01:25:28,837 --> 01:25:30,297
He's supposed to be the aggressor.

1376
01:25:30,505 --> 01:25:32,299
While continuing to pursue her,

1377
01:25:32,507 --> 01:25:35,677
which seems irrational given the circumstances,

1378
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:38,847
and leave home again?

1379
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:51,126
You can accuse

1380
01:25:51,234 --> 01:25:52,611
my client of softness,

1381
01:25:54,946 --> 01:25:55,964
cowardice,

1382
01:25:57,574 --> 01:25:58,633
weakness.

1383
01:25:59,826 --> 01:26:02,412
It isn't a model of virtue.
Oh no!

1384
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:06,875
But it does not make him a criminal.

1385
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:28,563
Miss Spick, was that a victory?

1386
01:26:28,772 --> 01:26:30,524
Much has been said about animals,

1387
01:26:30,732 --> 01:26:33,402
what was the role of the judge in this case?

1388
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:37,656
The truth prevailed, which is essential.

1389
01:26:37,989 --> 01:26:38,990
Mr.Kossarski?

1390
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:41,410
It is possible that the truth
may have been sad,

1391
01:26:41,618 --> 01:26:43,078
but...
Thank you, we're in a hurry.

1392
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,372
Mr.Kossarski, please. Monsieur?

1393
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:47,916
Miss Spick?

1394
01:26:51,962 --> 01:26:54,381
You were brilliant! It's incredible!

1395
01:26:54,589 --> 01:26:55,716
What did you do?

1396
01:26:56,925 --> 01:26:58,260
I feel revived.

1397
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:00,679
Thank Sam, really.

1398
01:27:01,012 --> 01:27:02,597
You gave a lot.

1399
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:08,061
Did you not you see him after the verdict?
Who? Sam?

1400
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:09,563
Sam.
No.

1401
01:27:11,314 --> 01:27:12,399
This is like, as it was before,

1402
01:27:13,483 --> 01:27:16,611
I did not realize I was happy and there I realize...

1403
01:27:19,197 --> 01:27:21,032
Fuck, I feel so relieved.

1404
01:27:23,076 --> 01:27:24,369
Me too.

1405
01:27:25,954 --> 01:27:27,622
I can't believe it's over.

1406
01:27:32,043 --> 01:27:34,212
You look tired, you need to rest.

1407
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:38,258
Do you know what would give me peace?

1408
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:40,719
Let's see that one more time.

1409
01:27:44,806 --> 01:27:46,057
Yeah, I would...

1410
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:48,226
I should not have involved you in my stories.

1411
01:27:51,188 --> 01:27:53,523
It's certain, you'll get back together.

1412
01:27:54,274 --> 01:27:56,985
That, really, I think I could not.

1413
01:28:16,087 --> 01:28:19,049
In her absence, the judge rejected the charges against me

1414
01:28:19,257 --> 01:28:22,594
and ordered me to pay her €90 in damages.

1415
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:25,597
The trial brought me advertising in...

1416
01:28:26,681 --> 01:28:30,143
No. Given the publicity that
the trial had brought me,

1417
01:28:30,352 --> 01:28:33,855
I was also ordered to change
the names of the characters.

1418
01:28:34,064 --> 01:28:37,442
I won, in exchange, the undisputed right

1419
01:28:37,651 --> 01:28:41,112
to continue the blog and the film
gathered an unexpected publicity.

1420
01:28:41,947 --> 01:28:45,492
I was proud that justice gave me back
my freedom of authorship.

1421
01:29:07,013 --> 01:29:09,683
You've reached the answering machine of Samuel and Mal.

1422
01:29:42,507 --> 01:29:43,600
Sam?

1423
01:29:43,884 --> 01:29:45,969
I kept calling you.

1424
01:29:46,177 --> 01:29:48,513
I did not know where you were. We won the trial.

1425
01:29:49,222 --> 01:29:51,099
Thank you, because I'm thankful to you.

1426
01:29:51,308 --> 01:29:53,643
And also, the fact that, ah...

1427
01:29:54,519 --> 01:29:55,770
you count on me,

1428
01:29:55,979 --> 01:29:57,063
very much.

1429
01:29:57,522 --> 01:29:58,598
I understand

1430
01:29:58,607 --> 01:30:02,485
why you stole money from me,
you wanted to show me your interest.

1431
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:07,657
I want to prove to you my gratitude.

1432
01:30:08,742 --> 01:30:10,035
It's a bit too late.

1433
01:30:10,952 --> 01:30:13,246
It works well, chemically, between us?

1434
01:30:13,455 --> 01:30:14,539
Chemically?

1435
01:30:14,881 --> 01:30:17,709
There's good chemistry in the works, don't you think?

1436
01:30:18,126 --> 01:30:20,420
I dunno, I don't understand what you are saying.

1437
01:30:22,213 --> 01:30:23,840
I want to live with you.

1438
01:30:25,467 --> 01:30:27,677
Without paying me? I'm lost.

1439
01:30:27,886 --> 01:30:30,764
Oh yes, no. Of course, I'll pay you.

1440
01:30:30,972 --> 01:30:33,433
I'm joking, I'm not a whore.

1441
01:30:33,642 --> 01:30:36,645
I think that would be a good thing.

1442
01:30:36,853 --> 01:30:38,438
Finally, any relationship

1443
01:30:38,813 --> 01:30:39,981
deserves an exchange.

1444
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:42,108
No relationship is balanced.

1445
01:30:42,317 --> 01:30:43,568
The very notion of balance

1446
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:46,237
ruins any possible form of connection.

1447
01:30:46,947 --> 01:30:48,490
The fact is, I'm afraid of you.

1448
01:30:49,491 --> 01:30:51,701
You have the sense of drama abnormally developed.

1449
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,370
Sam, I have...

1450
01:30:54,162 --> 01:30:56,831
I just understood that...

1451
01:31:00,043 --> 01:31:01,878
these last months...

1452
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:05,382
I did not have time to realize that...

1453
01:31:06,633 --> 01:31:08,593
that I was in love with you.

1454
01:31:12,263 --> 01:31:14,683
I understood this when you were gone,

1455
01:31:15,976 --> 01:31:17,560
I realized that...

1456
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:20,772
I was happy with you. I wasn't aware,

1457
01:31:20,981 --> 01:31:22,148
but I was happy.

1458
01:31:22,357 --> 01:31:24,734
I said nothing, I had my head in the trial.

1459
01:31:24,943 --> 01:31:26,152
Now I know.

1460
01:31:32,075 --> 01:31:33,134
I could

1461
01:31:33,284 --> 01:31:34,911
give you courses in law,

1462
01:31:35,578 --> 01:31:37,872
to introduce you to all the lawyers of Paris...

1463
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:40,125
Why did you wait so long?

1464
01:31:42,585 --> 01:31:43,670
I don't know.

1465
01:31:44,713 --> 01:31:47,257
I rarely have 2 seconds of inner peace.

1466
01:31:55,857 --> 01:32:04,057
* I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there *
* But she never comes and then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes *

1467
01:32:04,157 --> 01:32:12,857
* And I rise to face another day without her *
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

1468
01:32:12,957 --> 01:32:17,957
* It's just no good anymore *
* When you walk through the door of an empty room *

1469
01:32:18,057 --> 01:32:26,857
* And then you go inside and set a table for one *
* It's no fun when you spend a day without her *

1470
01:32:26,957 --> 01:32:31,957
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

1471
01:32:32,057 --> 01:32:35,057
* We burst the pretty balloon *
* Took us to the moon *

1472
01:32:35,157 --> 01:32:37,957
* Such a beautiful thing *
* But it's ended now *

1473
01:32:38,057 --> 01:32:44,957
* And it sounds like a lie *
* If I say I'd rather die than live without her *

1474
01:32:45,057 --> 01:32:49,857
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

1475
01:32:49,957 --> 01:32:52,957
* Love is a beautiful thing *
* When it knows how to swing *

1476
01:32:53,057 --> 01:32:57,057
* And it grooves like a clock *
* But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part *

1477
01:32:57,157 --> 01:33:06,057
* And it's breaking my heart to have to spend a day without her *
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

1478
01:33:24,857 --> 01:33:29,957
* I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there *
* But she never comes *

1479
01:33:30,057 --> 01:33:36,957
* And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes *
* And I rise to face another day without her *

1480
01:33:37,057 --> 01:33:43,007
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *
* Can't go on without her *

1481
01:33:43,107 --> 01:33:49,007
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do *
* There's no song without her *

1482
01:33:49,107 --> 01:34:01,077
* It's all wrong without her *
* Can't go on without her *

1483
01:34:01,101 --> 01:34:03,101
