AFRO SAMURAI
     Episode 4

3
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,020
Add one more
body to the body toll.

4
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,720
May God rest this
poor bastard's soul.

5
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,490
Yo, Afro! Ain't you
gonna say nuthin'?

6
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,460
I'm talking to you.

7
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,080
I said I'm talking to you!

8
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,620
Long time, no see, Afro.

9
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,190
Hey, correct me if I'm wrong,

10
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:22,640
But, I don't think a teddy bear is 
supposed to be walking around 
a damn kimono strapped with blades.

11
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,940
I got a bad feeling about this.

12
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,000
You don't want to be
messing with this guy, Afro.

13
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,760
I'm telling you, man.

14
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,280
That sh*t ain't natural!

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,190
He might look cute and all,
but I got a suspicion this one's a pro!

16
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,450
He for real!

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,010
Look, I know you got mad skills and all
and I ain't trying to be pessamistic here,

18
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,010
But you headed
straight to the dirt nap.

19
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,340
[coughing] Please!

20
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,800
This time you could really bite
 it, and I ain't going with you!

21
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,330
You sure about this?

22
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,800
Because if you is...

23
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,400
Suit yourself.

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,200
Oh, man!

25
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,040
Hey hey hey hey...

26
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,050
Yo yo yo!

27
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,520
Yo wait up, wait up, hold up!

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,100
Damn, you one
stubborn samurai.

29
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,480
Com'on man, chill, listen to
what I gotta say for once, please.

30
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,020
Ooooh, watch it!

31
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,910
He about to bust a two
sword move on you.

32
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,840
Oh, watch ya left, man.

33
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,050
No no no no no, watch ya right!

34
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,010
Why do you not draw
out your sword?

35
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,620
If you want the Number
One, you must first defeat me.

36
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,020
You have come to defeat 
the Number One, haven't you?

37
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,240
If you wear the Number Two
band, then you must fight.

38
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,380
' the hell?

39
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,850
Perhaps the rumors of the 
Afro Samurai are not true,

40
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,950
That he cuts all that
stand in his path,

41
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,950
That his only
movement is forward.

42
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,120
But you just look like
an afro headed coward!

43
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,320
Come to think of it, I can't even take a
warrior with such stupid hair seriously!

44
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,840
Afro!

45
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,400
What the dealio B'?

46
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,180
If you gonna run, run!

47
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,140
If you gonna fight,
then damnit, fight!

48
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,630
Such a fleeting moment in time...

49
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,860
Nothing remains,

50
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,360
Everything ends!

51
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,900
One!

52
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There is no such thing as killing
with strength or speed only.

53
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Kill the enemy with one calm, powerful stroke.

54
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,900
Two.

55
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The only form is action. Striking without 
thought is the only way to kill the enemy.

56
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Stop!

57
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Listen.

58
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The point of dueling is to kill
your enemy.

59
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Not twisting and turning, demonstrating
flowery form.

60
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,000
The only position is no position.

61
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,000
Where you hold your sword depends 
on your relationship with your opponent 
on the terrain and the situation.

62
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Act as the sea when the enemy 
is like the mountain.

63
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,000
Act as the mountain when the enemy 
is like the sea.

64
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Keep this in mind, all of you.

65
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes Master!

66
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,000
Real attacks are not static or with 
cooperative opponents.

67
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,000
Stick with the moves you've 
learned in class and you will die.

68
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,000
Even a glancing blow can unbalance 
your opponent and cripple his next 
offensive.

69
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,070
Hey, Jinno.

70
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,070
I have a question.

71
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,700
Why do you use two
swords instead of one?

72
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,040
With two I can be
the best, Otsuru.

73
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,680
See, there're
lots of reasons.

74
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,250
For example, it's great if you ever
have to fight more than one opponent
at a time.

75
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,250
You see, with two smaller blades, 
I can swing faster than a guy with 
both hands on one big sword.

76
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,660
And I can attack and
defend at the same time.

77
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,130
I could even fight if one of my arms got
cut off, 'cause I'd still have one left.

78
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,500
It's really the ultimate fighting style.

79
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:02,500
Hmm?

80
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,570
Oops, sorry. Guess I 
got a little carried away.

81
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,730
I'm... done.

82
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,000
Was your meal yummy Afro?

83
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,770
Jinno.

84
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,510
You're really serious about
sword fighting, aren't you?

85
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,720
Of course.
I have to protect everyone.

86
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,000
You. Afro.
All the students here.

87
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,430
When Sword Master
is too old to fight,

88
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,090
I'm gonna have to be strong
enough to look after this place.

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,420
I heard some pip-squeak's been
running loose, killing assassins.

90
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,980
That pip-squeak wouldn't happen 
to be a kid like this one we've got 
here, would it?

91
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,000
I think we got a match here, boys.

92
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,250
Eh, pip-squeak?

93
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,370
Wanna know where I
can find the Number Two.

94
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,840
Dunno nuthin' about it.

95
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,010
So what're you gonna
do about that?

96
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,480
'Cause you see, we're
on the same path, kid.

97
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,940
Rumors of the Number
Two led us to this dump.

98
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,250
And we can't have no
kid chasing our prize.

99
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,730
Afro!

100
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,040
Jinno!

101
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
What have you gotten yourself into?

102
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,140
Okay, you and I are
gonna talk about this later.

103
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,910
But first, I gotta
save your dumbass.

104
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
You son of a-

105
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,010
Afro!

106
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,610
Tell me what you know!

107
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,140
Where's the Number Two?

108
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,150
Number Two... is quite near...

109
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,450
Oh, it's you again.

110
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,750
There you go, sonny.

111
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,220
You just can't get enough
lemonade, can you?

112
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,590
Afro.

113
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,780
Forget avenging your father.

114
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,000
Live your own life.

115
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,000
Otsuru cares about you,
I care about you.

116
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,000
We're your family now.

117
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Look at that.
So beautiful.

118
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Wow.
Oh man.

119
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Say, you reckon I could be as strong as Master?

120
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
With your skills Sasuke? 
I'd say it'll take at least 50 years.

121
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
50 years!

122
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Whoa! Check out that one!

123
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,000
To get as strong as Master takes 
time.

124
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,000
His training must've been a 
100 times harder than ours.

125
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Man! I could be dead in 50 years.
Or even worse than that, old.

126
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,000
Dead. Man, Sasuke. Why do you 
always have to be so dang morbid?

127
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:38,000
He is right in a way though.

128
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,000
I mean we can't know for sure if 
any of us will be around 50 years 
from now.

129
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:45,000
Or even, 10 years from now. 

130
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:49,000
So there's no use in worrying about 
being as good as the Sword Master.

131
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:56,000
That's why you always have to 
live and fight like it's your last day
or eat like it's your last meal.

132
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,900
Wow. Cool. Wow.That is so bright!

133
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:07,000
Man, I sure hope my last meal 
has lots of mushrooms in it.

134
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I want my last meal to be absolutely 
smothered in chili peppers.

135
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Oh man. I could go for a chicken 
cutlet.

136
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,500
Afro, what about you? What do 
you want?

137
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,900
Afro wants linamode. Right Afro?

138
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Otsuru, it's lemonade, not linamode.

139
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,000
That's not a meal Otsuru. Huh? 
It's ok.

140
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:38,000
What would you like on your last 
day?

141
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I want those! Those fireworks 
are my favorite kind.

142
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,370
Good day, sir.

143
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,200
Well, hello there.

144
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,550
Thank you always for
your kind business with us.

145
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,970
Say, that Sword Master of yours...

146
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,470
Is he alright?

147
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,340
Huh?

148
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,810
On the festival evening, I heard 
that some rogue tried to start up 
a fight with him.

149
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,930
There are some odd
talks around the town.

150
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:28,840
That some sword dojo master is the
owner of the Number Two headband...

151
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,890
And they say that his students have
been brainwashed to be watchdogs.

152
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,020
What? Our Sword
Master wouldn't!

153
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,940
Sorry! Sorry.
I didn't mean to...

154
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,950
I mean there are plenty of other
Sword Masters everywhere,

155
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,350
So it must be some other man.

156
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,010
Jinno.

157
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,200
Did I wake you?

158
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,960
You should get some rest.

159
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,310
Master...

160
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,430
I smell blood.

161
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,730
I was attacked, but that
fool lost his life instead.

162
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,700
Sasuke.

163
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,540
Jinno.

164
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,880
Afro.

165
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,600
On this day, we commemorate
your graduation.

166
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,190
You are now great warriors.

167
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,140
Use wisely the sword
skills you have acquired.

168
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,590
Master.

169
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,980
Yes, Afro?

170
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,680
There is something
I would like to know.

171
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,940
Afro.

172
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,730
Are you really Number Two?

173
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,730
Afro.

174
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,960
After the midnight, before
the Boulè Tree, I will be waiting.

175
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,850
I meant to take the secret to the
grave, but I see I have no choice.

176
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,060
Choose, Afro Samurai!

177
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,380
Forget revenge...

178
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,200
Or fight me to the death for
the Number Two headband!

179
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,850
But know you well this truth.

180
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,180
If you win, you
will know no friend.

181
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,300
No joy. No love.

182
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:24,180
Only the murderous violence the Number 
Two headband incites in the heart of every 
man who desires the power of the Number One.

183
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,100
Truly, can you
handle that burden?

184
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,140
Afro!

185
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,030
Master, what's going on?

186
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,600
Master, please stop!

187
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,190
Afro, what are you doing?

188
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,440
Master?

189
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,100
There he is!

190
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,500
Quit your wasting your
time with that kid!

191
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,180
Jinno.

192
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,290
Fight us!

193
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,950
The Number Two headband is mine!

194
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,440
Master?

195
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,510
Jinno.

196
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,210
Take everyone and run.

197
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,370
Run and live.

198
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,450
Now you will see what it means
to wear the Number Two headband.

199
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,790
Master!

200
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,830
Master!

201
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,870
No!

202
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,950
Fool! Stay out of this!

203
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,010
Master!

204
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,980
Stay away from me!

205
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,170
Let's see what you've got.

206
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,390
Playtime's over, kiddies.

207
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,710
Sasuke! No!

208
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,080
Jiro! Matasaburo!

209
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,440
Otsuru!

210
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,200
Jinno!

211
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,330
Jinno...

212
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,470
Afro.

213
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,230
You have chosen your path.

214
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,370
Afro...

215
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,520
No... Don't...

216
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,140
Why?

217
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,670
Why did you kill our Master?

218
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,940
What have you done?

219
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:17,410
She's dead, and you...
You chose revenge over our Master.

220
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,480
Over everyone.

221
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,870
We're your family. Why?

222
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,720
For my... true father.

223
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,140
What about us?

224
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,290
What about us?

225
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,890
I...

226
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,980
Treated you as my brother.

227
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:58,510
I will never forgive you.

228
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,330
Jinno!

229
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,040
Hey Afro.

230
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,750
Boo.

231
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,450
What you're waiting for?

232
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,030
You really sure that's
the right decision?

233
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,660
I mean, if you don't wanna 
wear it, it's okay man.

234
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,510
Don't do it man, seriously.

235
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,870
Don't do it.

236
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,440
Damn, there goes
the neighborhood...

237
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,890
Good. I'm glad you've
lasted this long.

238
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,630
I want you to die slowly.

239
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:59,950
I want you to burn,
bleed, suffer as I have.

240
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,860
Come on! What is
taking so long?

241
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,570
Just finish him off!

242
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,310
I take orders from no one!

243
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,810
How dare you?

244
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,340
You will obey my orders
and finish the Afro.

245
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,730
You must not fail as
the Empty Seven have.

246
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,600
Don't compare me to them.

247
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,370
I don't care about
the useless headband.

248
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,580
I just want Afro!

249
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,030
I want him hurt!

250
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,750
I want him crippled!

251
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,410
He'll bleed for all the pain he's caused.

252
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,310
Do what you want, then.

253
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,630
You don't know
how long I've waited.

254
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:50,000
To avenge the deaths of those
who loved and trusted you!

255
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,510
My tears have
never stopped falling.

256
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,030
Since that day.

257
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,750
Jinno.

258
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
TO BE CONTINUED...
