00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:02,201
Ladies

2
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,250
You're in love. Nothing wrong with that.

3
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:18,933
Hey! A little token of my appreciation.

4
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:20,441
Thanks, dude.

5
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:21,874
You got that *token*?

6
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,025
Right. That's funny, man.

7
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:27,520
Hey, thanks for getting my back down there.
I appreciate it.

8
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:29,744
I hope we do business again real soon.

9
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:30,638
Real soon.

10
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:34,651
Sorry to harsh your mellow, dude.

11
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:44,287
Freeze!
Freeze!

12
00:01:46,087 --> 00:01:47,487
Hands up!

13
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:55,145
Hey, Shane.

14
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:58,345
Hey, Billie. Last time
I saw you, you were *naked*.

15
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:00,345
What'd he say?

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,650
What test you can take to tell if
you can no longer have children?

20
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:46,245
We going to flip this whale or what?

21
00:02:46,395 --> 00:02:48,645
He'll flip. Look he's looking
at a third strike.

22
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,044
He's a good snitch,
I've used him before.

23
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:52,353
Clean bust every time.
I trust him.

24
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:55,053
Personally, I'd like to know more
about the whole... *naked* thang.

25
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,901
That could help ease my pain.

26
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:59,137
I wasn't totally... *totally* naked.

27
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:00,437
I like this story.

28
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:02,316
Actually, technically, I think I was.

29
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,550
I really, really like this story.

30
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,350
Guys, I did vice. Remember?
Grow up, come on.

31
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:08,811
I've just gotten a visual.

32
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:13,835
So, Shane. You've
been a naughty boy.

33
00:03:13,935 --> 00:03:14,935
Yeah. I'm pretty screwed.

34
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:15,876
So screwed.

35
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:17,186
Just about every sense of the word.

36
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:19,626
The lingual sense and
the prison bitch sense.

37
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:22,422
So, you know the drill, okay.
You can either take the third strike...

38
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,880
and spend the rest of your life rotting
in Pelican Bay or you can deal.

39
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:29,728
What would I have to deal?
You just busted me with 3000 pounds of weed.

40
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:32,516
Give us Trey McNeal.
Trey's my best friend.

41
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,290
You've been his whipping boy
ever since you could walk.

42
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,390
Listen, you give us Trey *and* the
Circle gang and *you* can walk.

43
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,790
You make sure Anna and
Latisha make it home.

44
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:46,202
They're both good girls
that come from nice families.

45
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:48,577
Well, one of them almost made it so
that *I* could never have a family.

46
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:51,252
Which one was it?
Thanks.

47
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:56,675
Okay, Shane. Your choice.
Third strike? Or your last chance?

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,298
Let's do this.

49
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:15,528
Trey McNeal. He moves
3000 pounds a month

50
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:19,128
with the help of his life long posse,
the Circle gang.

51
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,636
They're loyal to the death.

52
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:23,243
A group of Orange County surfers
who are either too mean

53
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:28,249
or too ugly to get sponsored.
So they found something more profitable.

54
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:32,191
They handle most of Orange County,
South Bay, Venice, Santa Monica,

55
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:36,829
Malibu, Beverly Hills and the West Side.
They're all about the lifestyle.

56
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,876
If you smell like you're not
about the lifestyle,

57
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:42,000
you'll be rejected like a bum kidney.

58
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:51,072
Shane is going to buy us
a ticket on the inside.

59
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:54,170
After that, it's up to you
to win Trey over.

60
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,126
We interrupted the Mexican pipeline,

61
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:59,360
where the gang has been getting
their weed for the last eight years.

62
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,608
At least temporarily.
So Trey?

63
00:05:01,638 --> 00:05:04,238
He's going to be hungry for product.

64
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:07,188
If Trey doesn't have his weed
when his clients come calling?

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,053
He's going to be out of business.

66
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,049
We're going to give Shane
Candy Store cash.

67
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,903
He's going to explain that
he got away with the cash,

68
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:18,115
but the Mexican connection is over.

69
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:21,375
You guys are going to be introduced
as new potential suppliers from

70
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:23,275
Humboldt County up north.

71
00:05:23,283 --> 00:05:26,453
You'll be selling him the weed
we confiscated off the boat.

72
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:29,661
Each pound will be tracked with
a radioactive dye marker.

73
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:31,639
We'll be following every single pound.

74
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,225
Bust this entire network wide open.

75
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:35,625
How much do we tell Shane?

76
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,039
Like any snitch - minimum.

77
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:38,239
No offence, but uh,

78
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,732
I can keep working the Serbian thing
and let Van take this one.

79
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:43,535
Are you getting close to the Serbians?

80
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,230
Not really.
So?

81
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,819
He hates the beach.

82
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:48,725
Hate's a strong word, Van,

83
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,265
but not strong enough.
I *despise* the beach.

84
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:53,547
I do not dig sand or (?) waves.

85
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,797
I look bad in shorts and I'm not into
skinny white girls with dreadlocks.

86
00:05:56,798 --> 00:05:58,541
I could go on.
Please. It's fascinating.

87
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:00,441
Well, there's the Beach Boys.
Okay, don't even.

88
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:02,939
Brian Wilson is the greatest pop
composer of the 20th century.

89
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,539
What? Next to Barry Manilow?

90
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,039
You know what? I feel so
confident in what I know that

91
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,874
I don't even need to dignify
that with a response.

92
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,194
Please don't.
Okay, I will.

93
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:12,394
Do you know how ground breaking
his orchestrations were?

94
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:13,702
Wild Honey? 1968?

95
00:06:13,703 --> 00:06:17,202
All right, you know what? I can't decide
which one of you is more annoying.

96
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:19,484
Well, I guess then we can't
give you your present.

97
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,991
Present?
What present?

98
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:25,831
Oh, you don't want a present
from two annoying guys, eh?

99
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:27,946
Noooo. Never that.

100
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,823
I like presents. I do.
I want a present.

101
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,633
Then we should.

102
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,726
All right. Turn around.
Close your eyes.

103
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,449
Oh no.

104
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,000
All right. Go ahead. No peeking.

105
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,850
Okay. You know what? I can't see.
My eyes are closed.

106
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:45,271
You don't have to do that.

107
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:48,181
All right. Right here.
Open. Peel it.

108
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:59,071
Is this? Is this the
Steve McQueen car?

109
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:02,447
1968 fastback. Bullet is back.

110
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:06,204
Well, we wrecked it.
We figure. We restore it.

111
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:11,057
Wow. It... It looks pretty good.

112
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:13,708
Well, it'll look a little
better with you in it.

113
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:18,076
Hey, make sure you put a
third coat of wax on her.

114
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:21,076
You know, before 'she'
deals with the elements.

115
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,667
Chance of rain.

116
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Hey Trey.

117
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,478
Dude, your phone call
freaked everyone out.

118
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:10,078
I'm glad you're okay, Fetch.

119
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,825
Barely got back with the cash.

120
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,771
And what good is cash
going to do us now? Huh?

121
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,616
Well, you know...

122
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,380
Well, you know? What am I supposed
to tell my clients when they show up?

123
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,290
Uh, sorry, could you, uh, come back later?
We're gone fishing?

124
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,675
Come on! What are you thinking?
Tell him what you told me, Shane.

125
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,300
Nah. He'll just get pissed.

126
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:37,798
Oh. I hurt his feeeelings.
Is the baby gonna cry? Huh?

127
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,000
- Just tell him, Shane.
- I know these two guys.

128
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:42,700
Yeah?

129
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,608
And they deal volume
out of Humboldt.

130
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:48,809
And where did you... meet
these guys? On a bus?

131
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,588
Carlos.
*Carlos*?

132
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:51,300
Yeah.

133
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:54,532
Carlos, the V-13 gang banger, Carlos?

134
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,100
Yeah.

135
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:59,038
Carlos, who got capped in his money car,
Carlos? You mean, dead Carlos?

136
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,500
Yes. He said they did some
business with them.

137
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:04,401
So, maybe we should call
them up and order...

138
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:08,000
what do you think? Three, four
thousand pounds? Sound good?

139
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:10,646
I don't know.

140
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,500
No, seriously. Let's call 'em.

141
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah? Okay.

142
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:22,800
Yeah, right.

143
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:25,882
Fetch, like I'm gonna get
my hook-up through you.

144
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,100
No, I don't think so.

145
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,400
We've got to start looking
for a new hook-up or

146
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:31,500
word is going to get out
that we've lost our juice.

147
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,800
Soon as that happens, we're dead.

148
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,700
Ah, what the hell?

149
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:44,500
They got some nice stanky up
there in Humboldt, huh?

150
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,000
Why don't you bring these jokers by?

151
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,600
We'll see if they're down.

152
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,500
Cool.

153
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
This is Van. That's Deaq.

154
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,500
- What's up?
- Trey.

155
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,400
This is Jimmy. That's Zoe.

156
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:15,800
Your boy Shane says you might
wanna... hang some time.

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,999
Maybe.

158
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,999
That's cool. Let me tell
you something though

159
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,400
- I got a system of checking references
that makes TRW look amateur.

160
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,700
You don't check out, you won't
ever hear from us again.

161
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:32,300
Except maybe by way of
a single hollow point.

162
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,300
Found us a couple of
hard guys, huh, Fetch?

163
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,199
I like it. Go ahead.

164
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,600
Do your due diligence.
We'll do ours.

165
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,000
If it all checks out, why don't you
come hang out at the house later on?

166
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,300
Come on.

167
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,450
Betrayal.

168
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,400
Oh yeah, somebody's gonna
be zoning somebody.

169
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:30,500
How would you feel if that
somebody was Trey McNeal?

170
00:11:30,701 --> 00:11:32,900
That's one bad surfer boy.

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,300
He's been dumping weed into the
neighbourhood for ten years.

172
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:36,600
Yeah, we're taking him down.

173
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:39,100
But we need you to put
in a word for us, playa.

174
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:41,399
That boy's own mother could
vouch for ya and that would mean

175
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,200
absolutely nothin'. Gonna take more
than my word to get him to set up.

176
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:46,000
Like what?

177
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:48,200
He needs a boot in his ass.

178
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,300
Like a Jack boot.

179
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,300
You're a genius.

180
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,200
Somebody wanna let me in on this?

181
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,800
VRB.
Venice Ride Boys.

182
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,500
Surf Nazi gang. They been looking
to jump in on Trey's action for years.

183
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:08,700
Aquarius puts out the word
that Trey is vulnerable,

184
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:10,450
he'd be more than
willing to buy from us.

185
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:12,600
Create the need for weed
and we deliver the goods.

186
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:13,400
Bingo, baby.

187
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,200
Damn. Dude is hella a surfer, though.

188
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,100
Drop in on me once and BOW,
knocked me right outta a curl.

189
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,500
Come on, man. Don't even start that.

190
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,500
I know you ain't surfing, now.
Stop playing.

191
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:27,200
I don't surf? What?
Fat people don't surf?

192
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:28,650
Take a look at this right here, man.

193
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,000
You know what this is?

194
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,600
That's Zuma.
This right here.

195
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:36,250
That's the Pipeline.
And this right here?

196
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:37,800
Todos Santos.
Exactly.

197
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,200
I'm a big wave man.

198
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,900
Hey, Van, on the real, partner.
We should come out here

199
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:43,000
one morning, hit a little somethin'.

200
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:44,200
Anytime, anywhere.

201
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:46,350
As we should. Now, check this, man.

202
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:48,800
I unleash those skinheads on the Circle gang.

203
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,300
Y'all better be ready throw down
on them swastika asses, man.

204
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,000
Leave the ass whooping to us.
You make the phone calls.

205
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
All right, now.

206
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,816
You really like it?

207
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,500
I love it. You gonna love it too.

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,500
Don't hate. Congratulate.
Room for all of us, man.

209
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,999
Seriously, Van. Surf Nazis?

210
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:16,400
That pretty much closes deal on how
I feel about this whole beach thing.

211
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
What about that?
You like that?

212
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,500
I'm feeling that.

213
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,000
Hey, guys. I don't know, man.

214
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,100
What? What's the matter, Shane?
Talk to us.

215
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:36,321
He's too smart. I feel like he knows
I'm selling him out already.

216
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,749
And you know what? He's going to
kill me. That's what he's gonna do.

217
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,490
Whoa, man. Chill out.

218
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,100
He's smart. We're smarter.
And we got your back.

219
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,400
And all you gotta do,
man, is just be Shane.

220
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:46,500
I don't even know who
that is any more, Deaq.

221
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:49,900
I go to Mexico and I
know exactly who I am.

222
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,100
They love me. I go down there.
I stay in my house in Ensenada.

223
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:56,200
I'm a hero. They think
*I'm* the cool guy.

224
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,400
Ok. You're the cool guy,
wherever you go.

225
00:13:58,401 --> 00:14:00,600
This guy Trey's just got
you all twisted, that's all.

226
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,280
No, man. He recognized
you guys were cool.

227
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,150
He accepted you, just like that.

228
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,100
Man, you got it bad.
I mean, real bad.

229
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:09,700
But you know what? We gonna
get you out of this, man.

230
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,750
So you're saying, if I work this out,

231
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,000
I got a shot at a new life?

232
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:16,108
That's part on you, dude.

233
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,650
That part's on me.

234
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,000
So your operation checks out.
I was very impressed.

235
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,850
Thanks, dude.

236
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,950
Maybe one of these days,
we can talk business.

237
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,700
You've really never
been on a surfboard?

238
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,550
Where I grew up, a surfboard
would get you shot.

239
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,700
Out here, a surfboard will
*keep* you from getting shot.

240
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,650
Come on.

241
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,300
Where we going?

242
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,500
I'm gonna give you a surfing lesson.

243
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,460
That's very funny.

244
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:10,205
Cos it sounded like you said
you're giving me a surfing lesson.

245
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,050
I'll grab you a wetsuit
and we're going surfing.

246
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,999
Yeah, right.

247
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:20,250
Wait. I let you on *my* beach and
you're going to refuse to get on a board?

248
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:23,750
Looks like the moment of truth
has arrived, partner. Surf or die.

249
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:26,250
Oh, so I'm supposed to let a
bunch of wimpy white dudes

250
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:28,900
convince to do something
I ain't never gonna do?

251
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,400
Ever.

252
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,600
Come on.

253
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,200
All right, dude.
That's it! You got it!

254
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,050
Get back on that horse, dude!

255
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,000
So, Fetch.

256
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,900
Yeah?

257
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:21,400
You've been in love with Zoe for
like what? Five? Six years, is it?

258
00:16:21,551 --> 00:16:22,350
I don't know.

259
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't know. You should learn
something from Deaq, dude.

260
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:30,100
He's known her for what? A day?
He could nail her tonight if he wanted to.

261
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,800
So what, man? It's not like
she'd go out with me anyways.

262
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:40,200
Fetch, Fetch, Fetch. Loser
mentality, amigo. I told you.

263
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:15,350
Now that? Is the right way to
burn through the last of our stash.

264
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:18,099
- That's the last of it, huh?
- So what?

265
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,808
You tell me, dude.

266
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Up, up. We got visitors.

267
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,700
Now, ladies. Word is out that you're
having some supplier problems.

268
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,460
Guess the, uh, wetback
connection is out of business.

269
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,100
Yeah? Where'd you hear that?

270
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:50,977
- Dan Rather.
- What if it was?

271
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:56,150
Well, then. We could help you out.
Take over your territory.

272
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:58,150
Till you're back on your feet again.

273
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,300
And what then?

274
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:02,800
We could work something
out. We split it.

275
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:04,400
You walk into our territory...

276
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:09,680
Hey! It's only your territory as
long you've got the product, chief.

277
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:11,680
Hey, why don't you run
off back to the bunker and...

278
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:14,050
get your lips pretty for the funeral?
Why don't you do that?

279
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,100
What did you say, boy?

280
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:17,350
I think he said you
were his Nazi bitch.

281
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,400
Nazi?

282
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,150
You wanna sit? Huh?

283
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,000
A'right. Who wants to
play hide the bullet?

284
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,280
Who want it?!

285
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,961
Nice to meet you.

286
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,200
Get it? This is circle territory.

287
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:05,700
Van. Deaq. That's some heads up play.
And where the hell were you, numbnuts?

288
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:06,400
Shut it!

289
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:10,000
Why don't you guys come by
the house tomorrow?

290
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,900
Maybe we can do some business, huh?

291
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:19,400
And Fetch, got to save your new
boyfriend, didn't you? That was so cool.

292
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,890
Straight up, Shane.
You saved my life, dawg.

293
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,369
Thank you, Deaq.

294
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:37,000
You know why I want
to make this case?

295
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,300
So you can have Zoe all to yourself?

296
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,000
Nah, man. I'm just tired of watching
Trey punk his homeboy, Shane.

297
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,680
I want Shane out from under
that dog. I mean, it's sad, right?

298
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,450
I mean, he's so deep in it,
he can't even see how bad it is.

299
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:52,025
End of the day, that's up to Shane, man.

300
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:55,400
I know what I'm talking about.
I grew up with a lot of kids like that.

301
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:57,300
Me too. And you know what?

302
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:59,900
It's a tough place to come
from, I know that feeling.

303
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:02,143
What are you talking about?

304
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:05,450
When I was banging, I was
the skinny puppy of my set.

305
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:09,350
I was a little younger, I was small,
and I guess those cats knew...

306
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:13,010
I didn't really wanna be there.
There was this OG(?),

307
00:20:13,101 --> 00:20:16,200
Maurice, they used to call him eight ball,

308
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:19,560
and this cat used to ride my ass
from the moment I came in...

309
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:24,444
'till the moment I left. I mean he
made every minute living hell for me.

310
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,300
Man.

311
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,004
You know how much grief
I'm going to give you about that right?

312
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,200
Why? Why you gotta do
me like that, dawg?

313
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:36,000
I mean, I'm trying open up here.

314
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,671
Right, no. No, don't stop.
I like it.

315
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:39,100
You see, I'm expressing, a'right?

316
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:41,042
All right. Express yourself.

317
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:43,200
Open up. I wanna be the
shoulder you lean on.

318
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,280
- Tell me more.
- I have nothing else to say.

319
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:47,980
All right. Healthy power,
Scrappy Doo.

320
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:48,625
A'right.

321
00:21:00,386 --> 00:21:03,486
Zoe!! Zoe! Help!

322
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:05,925
You're Deaq.

323
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,809
You're a funny man there, Trey.

324
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:09,372
But you know what, I sell Chronic.

325
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:13,344
I deal in volume to avoid all the
customer relations hassles, man.

326
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:17,274
So if we don't get with the kiss called
closure by the end of business *to-day*,

327
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,146
we're taking our goods
down the road.

328
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:25,364
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just
you, on the water, was, uh...

329
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:29,783
Maybe I do have a stereotypical black
man's version of water sports,

330
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:31,105
but you know what?

331
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,600
I will get on anything with wheels except
a skateboard and crush you, playa.

332
00:21:36,057 --> 00:21:36,927
Really?

333
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,198
Believe it. And just to
make it interesting,

334
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,379
when I do crush you?
We start business today.

335
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,434
All right. I like that.

336
00:21:54,985 --> 00:21:58,285
Hey, if you don't have a cast iron
nutsack, you better (?) in quick.

337
00:21:58,286 --> 00:21:59,983
You better get a mint.

338
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:18,205
Fastest wheels without a motor.

339
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,242
These things are custom built.
Five large a pop.

340
00:22:21,476 --> 00:22:24,076
I was thinking like a nice
motorcycle race or something.

341
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:26,470
What's the matter? Brothers
don't luge either, big mouth?

342
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,299
You know what? After I kick
his ass, I'll be kicking yours.

343
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,910
Okay. Do your thing,
Captain America.

344
00:22:36,754 --> 00:22:38,954
First one to the intersection
rules the world.

345
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,520
Yeah!

346
00:24:22,147 --> 00:24:24,487
Here's to a long and
profitable association.

347
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:25,478
I hear that.

348
00:24:25,694 --> 00:24:28,194
Make your payments well,
we'll be best of friends.

349
00:24:28,331 --> 00:24:33,001
Mmm mmm. You know what that
means for Fetch, huh? Don't you? Huh?

350
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:36,227
No more trips to Mexico to
be the conquering hero.

351
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:39,979
He goes back to being *full*
*time* *bitch*. Don't you?

352
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,000
Here's to Fetch. Full time bitch.

353
00:24:45,781 --> 00:24:49,001
You don't have to do anything.
Just stay in until the bust happens.

354
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:50,439
Dude, it's almost over.

355
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,338
Just. Just play tight.

356
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,080
We make the deal, then track
the weed to the distributors.

357
00:24:55,098 --> 00:24:57,500
Keep your head in the game,
we have a lot riding on this.

358
00:24:57,518 --> 00:25:00,060
Shane's head's been in the
game this whole case, Billie.

359
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,698
Then what is it?
What's the problem?

360
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,389
Okay, look. Let's say
this all goes great.

361
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:06,832
In the perfect world of this thing,
I'm going to frame all my friends and...

362
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,898
send them off to prison
for a long, long time.

363
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,898
So you get new friends, man.
You need new friends. Trust me.

364
00:25:12,908 --> 00:25:16,888
And then I what?! Sling lattes
at Starbucks and wait...

365
00:25:16,898 --> 00:25:19,598
for someone to come in and bust
a cap in my head? Is that it?

366
00:25:19,612 --> 00:25:21,198
New friends. New life.

367
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:24,998
Get out from anything and everything
that's been keeping you down, man.

368
00:25:25,198 --> 00:25:28,489
I know there's a new you in
there, just waiting to happen.

369
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:31,998
If you want it. Otherwise, sooner
or later, you'll find a new circle,

370
00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:34,698
another Trey McNeal to slap you
around and then who knows?

371
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,598
Two years from now we can be
standing around in a dark street,

372
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,398
having this same conversation.

373
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:44,698
No, no, no. You guys are right.

374
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:48,008
He's been happening to me
since I was nine years old.

375
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:52,298
Trey's been picking on me. People've
been telling me to 'fetch'.

376
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:58,298
You're right. I need to start from
scratch. And you know what?

377
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:03,898
Nobody's going to recognize
the new me. Nobody.

378
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:07,598
Let's get out of here.

379
00:26:31,571 --> 00:26:32,571
Got the stuff?

380
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,125
It's in the truck.

381
00:26:38,908 --> 00:26:43,508
What is up with you, Fetch?!
Forget to take your Ritalin?

382
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:45,891
No. You know, I'm just...

383
00:26:45,892 --> 00:26:47,491
What?! Pissing your pants?

384
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:49,391
Yeah, I'm pissing my pants, Trey.

385
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:52,291
Okay, guys. Could you finish
this deal before daybreak?

386
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:53,691
Why don't you tell him
to get off my back?

387
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,191
Or what? You gonna start crying?

388
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:56,743
Yeah, I'm going to start crying.
What if you start...

389
00:26:56,745 --> 00:27:00,229
All right, look! How about we all
just maintain before 5-0 busts?

390
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,153
You guys can settle your
domestic disputes at home.

391
00:27:02,155 --> 00:27:04,507
Yeah, Shane. It's all good.

392
00:27:22,598 --> 00:27:23,538
Gotcha.

393
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:26,481
First thing, tomorrow morning.

394
00:27:26,957 --> 00:27:28,557
You guys should come
by the house.

395
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:30,090
Talk about the next deal.

396
00:27:30,102 --> 00:27:32,683
Nice doing business with y'all.

397
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:35,783
You too.

398
00:27:44,883 --> 00:27:47,083
All right. You wanna talk about how
Shane almost screwed up the play?

399
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,417
Look. We're gonna back into this all right?

400
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:52,303
All we need our boy to do is hang
in there, keep his mouth shut,

401
00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:54,587
and let the weed show
us who's distributing.

402
00:27:54,487 --> 00:27:57,807
But since we're on this subject and
we got some quality you and me time,

403
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,287
what's your problem with the guy?

404
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,368
I know his equation, okay?

405
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,408
I grew up on the same
sand, same waves.

406
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:07,012
You got nothing at home,
so you start this group.

407
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:09,999
Your circle. That's your family,
it's the only family you got.

408
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:13,237
We're dealing with somebody
who's turning on their own family.

409
00:28:13,254 --> 00:28:14,434
One screwed up family at that.

410
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:18,915
That's not the point. He's the guy
that doesn't fit in. *Anywhere*.

411
00:28:18,922 --> 00:28:22,082
He's not strong enough to stand
without the family and he's too weak...

412
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,219
to pull his weight within
the family. Guys like that,

413
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,350
they always have a problem

414
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:27,472
they're always going to be on the outside.

415
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:40,631
Fetch?

416
00:28:43,007 --> 00:28:43,907
Hey.

417
00:28:44,272 --> 00:28:45,172
What are you doing?

418
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:51,902
I asked you.
- What you're doing?

419
00:28:55,064 --> 00:28:58,664
I heard you. I just didn't care.

420
00:29:00,382 --> 00:29:02,122
That's funny, Fetch.

421
00:29:02,547 --> 00:29:05,591
Well, let me clue you in. I'm
taking the cash and the weed...

422
00:29:05,592 --> 00:29:08,000
and I'm going to Mexico to
live happily ever after.

423
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:10,000
Dude, what are you talking about?

424
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:12,350
Oh, that's right. Sounds crazy.

425
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,180
That's because I forgot
to tell you the part where

426
00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:15,680
I'm going to smoke your ass first.

427
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,380
Fetch, you are *so* *high*.

428
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,460
That's right. I'm high. I'm high
on how dead you're gonna be.

429
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,780
Huh?!

430
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,580
That hurts, doesn't it, huh?

431
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,050
You know why? That's the way you've
been slapping me since we were kids.

432
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:21,085
Awww. Is the baby gonna
cry? Baby gonna cry?

433
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:22,559
Please.

434
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,275
Don't worry. It'll all be over soon.

435
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:02,224
Trey!!

436
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,898
It was the new guys. Van and
Deaq. They came in here...

437
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,651
and they took the cash.
And all the weed.

438
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,388
I knew those guys were going
to make a move. I knew it!!

439
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:26,938
If you knew, why didn't you
*do* something about it!?

440
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,280
I didn't even let them in, Shane!

441
00:31:28,281 --> 00:31:30,412
I didn't let 'em in. Trey brought them in!!

442
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:34,650
Now we have to go get those guys.
All right, here's the deal, man.

443
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,580
They're probably going
back up north to Humboldt.

444
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:40,600
They're not going to be speeding, they
got a car full of drugs and cash, right?

445
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:43,500
So don't sit there and
stare at me. Go get 'em!!

446
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,240
All right.

447
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,150
We're taking you to a hospital.

448
00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:58,010
No, I can take myself to the hospital.

449
00:31:58,011 --> 00:31:58,898
I can't stay here alone.

450
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,960
If you don't stay here, the house
is going to be vulnerable, all right?!

451
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,869
You can get me on the cell phone.

452
00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:29,890
Okay, tell me you don't have like the
smallest urge to get back on a surfboard.

453
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,295
What is it with you, Van?

454
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,876
It's like you're trying to
convert me to your religion.

455
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,065
Just tell me. Be honest.

456
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,535
- No. It's not fair.
- See. You're hooked.

457
00:32:36,536 --> 00:32:38,211
No, Van . It's an
expertise thing, okay?

458
00:32:38,215 --> 00:32:39,000
Okay.

459
00:32:38,615 --> 00:32:40,615
- All right? I like to have mastery, right?
- Mastery.

460
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,400
I would do it again like
to... to get better.

461
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,837
Hooked!

462
00:32:46,385 --> 00:32:47,285
Yeah?

463
00:32:47,578 --> 00:32:49,650
Hey, Van. The dope is
moving. All of it.

464
00:32:49,707 --> 00:32:52,707
The dye marker in the
weed is emitting a signal.

465
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,494
Well, maybe Trey sold
it all to one buyer.

466
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:56,483
Okay, I'm going to follow this
stuff. You meet with Trey,

467
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,483
see if you can find out
who the buyer is.

468
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,529
We'll come back you up!

469
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,199
You guys need to still
show up at the house.

470
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,499
You don't, you're going to
jeopardize your cover.

471
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,400
All right. Dope's moving.
Something's not right.

472
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:13,799
I love my job.

473
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:36,499
Ouch. That's gotta hurt.

474
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:39,809
Call Billie.

475
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:45,499
Yeah?

476
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,599
Billie. Trey McNeal is dead.

477
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,899
And the Circle gang looks
like they've been jacked.

478
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,520
They got the money
and the drugs.

479
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,899
All right. Find Shane and
pull him out. This is over.

480
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,860
I want you out of that house now.
I'm going to call for backup to meet me.

481
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,099
Yeah.

482
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,417
Let's check the house.

483
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:05,200
Drop your guns!!

484
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,230
Whoa! Hold. Hold up. Zoe.

485
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,209
Zoe. Zoe.

486
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,709
Look. We're putting the gun
down, all right? Look.

487
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,350
All right?

488
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,099
What the hell are you doing here?

489
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:20,899
We came here to meet
Trey. What happened?

490
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,799
You killed Trey!
That's what happened.

491
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,800
Okay. Whoa, whoa. What makes
you think we killed Trey?

492
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:28,899
You killed Trey and
you tried to kill Shane.

493
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,050
Come on now.
Who told you that?

494
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,980
Shane!!

495
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,880
Ah, that little dwiblet.

496
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:34,460
Shut up!!

497
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,899
Okay. So wait. Think about it.
We're here. Where's Shane?

498
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:42,090
He went to the hospital
because of his *bullet wound*.

499
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,999
I was going to take him, but
he said he could drive himself.

500
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,430
Okay, Zoe. He didn't
want the girl he's in love...

501
00:34:49,431 --> 00:34:53,330
with to take him to the hospital?
He wanted to drive himself?

502
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:54,267
Come on, think about it.

503
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,790
Why would we come
back if we killed Trey?

504
00:34:58,899 --> 00:34:59,950
Come on now.

505
00:35:03,072 --> 00:35:06,372
Shane. He killed Trey?

506
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,530
That's right.
We wanna go find him.

507
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,899
Unless you're gonna shoot
us today, Zoe, come on.

508
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:16,180
I'm not going to shoot anybody.
I just can't believe this.

509
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,900
Believe it quick.
Put the gun down.

510
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,000
So we can get the hell out
of here and find him, okay?

511
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,389
Now look, you might want to
grab a change of clothes and...

512
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,289
surfboard and get the hell out
of here cause there's gonna be...

513
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,880
a lot of heat on this
place soon. All right?

514
00:35:42,943 --> 00:35:44,790
Just keep heading south, that's
where the dope is moving.

515
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,469
The next time I tell you I hate the
beach, would you please listen to me!?

516
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,872
Next time I say 'Don't trust a
snitch,' will you please listen to me?!

517
00:36:05,384 --> 00:36:06,084
Hello?

518
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,730
Shane. What are you doing?

519
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,260
Going back to the house.

520
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,380
I'm right behind you, Shane.

521
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,700
So you are.

522
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,188
Why don't you pull over
and we'll talk about it?

523
00:36:20,467 --> 00:36:21,767
I don't think so, Billie.

524
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:23,221
Would you rather get shot?!

525
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,580
Yeah, I guess I would.

526
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,490
Okay, you know what? This
is your last chance, Shane.

527
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,460
And I'm going to take it, okay?

528
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:29,580
Cause I'm tired of people
like you trying to stop me.

529
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:31,390
People like me? What is
that supposed to mean?

530
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:33,290
People who make me go
out and fetch for them...

531
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,095
while they got to
live their lives!

532
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:37,416
Well, you know what?
I'm tired of fetching, Billie.

533
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,758
So short answer?
I'm not pulling over.

534
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,984
Okay. I see that you're having a
little psychotic Victor moment,

535
00:36:42,985 --> 00:36:45,083
but you know what, Shane.
I don't have time.

536
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:48,040
I'm on the clock. And I've
got twenty highway patrols...

537
00:36:48,044 --> 00:36:49,640
who are going to
show up any minute.

538
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,352
Well, they can come
and get me, bitch.

539
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:52,167
Okay, that's it.

540
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:14,770
Pull over, Shane!

541
00:37:15,997 --> 00:37:16,450
Now!!

542
00:38:08,716 --> 00:38:09,516
Hello?

543
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,024
Billie. It was Shane.
Shane killed Trey.

544
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:15,157
Yeah. I kinda figured that
when he was trying to kill me.

545
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,907
He ran me off the road.

546
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,451
You all right?

547
00:38:17,572 --> 00:38:21,302
Yeah, no, I've been better.
I think I dislocated my shoulder.

548
00:38:21,555 --> 00:38:23,699
And I might have
broken some ribs.

549
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,499
But I'm really bummed
about my Mustang.

550
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,478
Look, I think he's headed to Mexico.
He has a house in Ensenada.

551
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,304
Ugh. You gonna
call border patrol?

552
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:32,327
No, no. I think we
can handle this one.

553
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,993
Yeah. I was hoping you
were going to say that.

554
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:36,595
Okay. This is what
you're going to do.

555
00:38:36,596 --> 00:38:39,494
Screw jurisdiction, screw
protocol, screw everything.

556
00:38:39,495 --> 00:38:41,275
I want you to nail
that scale to the wall.

557
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:42,606
You're turning me on.

558
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:44,549
That's what I do.

559
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,500
I want you to find him
and bring him back.

560
00:38:54,277 --> 00:38:56,807
I can't believe how easy it is to
drive guns across the border.

561
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,280
You ready?
Cause I want this guy.

562
00:39:17,798 --> 00:39:21,378
Hey guys. Thought
you'd be stopping by.

563
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,200
Welcome to my crib.

564
00:39:24,054 --> 00:39:26,489
You remember Anna and Latisha.

565
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,000
Ah, how could I forget?

566
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,023
Looking pretty casual
there, buddy.

567
00:39:29,442 --> 00:39:31,032
That's because you
can't arrest me.

568
00:39:31,332 --> 00:39:32,332
I'm out of your jurisdiction.

569
00:39:33,981 --> 00:39:35,445
Estamos en México.

570
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,210
I bet you wished we cared.

571
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,999
Oh, so you're planning some
international inappropriate...

572
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,999
kidnapping thing?

573
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,280
Yeah. Something like that.

574
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:44,350
I want you to know,
I really like you guys.

575
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,611
You were straight shooters.

576
00:39:45,612 --> 00:39:47,380
I wouldn't want anything
bad to happen to you.

577
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,000
Anything bad to
happen to us?

578
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,301
You're high. Right, Shane?

579
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:51,290
Absolutely.

580
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,750
You know what? You
mess with your people?

581
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,128
That's one thing. But
you crossed a really...

582
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,600
unfortunate line this time. This
time you messed with *my* family.

583
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:02,000
Who? Billie? She
was in my way.

584
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:03,280
Did I miss something?

585
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,400
When did you become
such a bad boy, Shane?

586
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:08,550
Are you kidding me,
Van? You put me here.

587
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:11,586
You made me.
Don't you remember?

588
00:40:11,886 --> 00:40:15,300
You showed me my full potential.
You know, starting over?

589
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,299
You really don't
want to do that.

590
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,650
I really want to
do it. Do you?!

591
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,610
Yeah, I really,
really want to do it.

592
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,180
Go inside, girls.

593
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,377
Why don't you just get
into the car with us, Shane?

594
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,040
So we're not forced
to kill your ass.

595
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:29,910
Yeah, there's that.

596
00:40:29,911 --> 00:40:32,976
Don't you realize, that
in Mexico, I am God?

597
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:39,900
You can't put God in jail.
You can't kill God.

598
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:46,890
But Trey? I *loooved* whacking
him. And Billie? Whatever.

599
00:40:46,899 --> 00:40:49,148
Dude. You're alone
and unarmed, okay?

600
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,348
So why don't you tone
down the cocky thing.

601
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:10,420
Okay, I get the
cocky thing now.

602
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:12,790
You know what I just realized?

603
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,100
This is a Mexican standoff *in Mexico*.

604
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,822
Guess what? Final de
la música, amigo.

605
00:41:43,203 --> 00:41:45,603
You were right, Shane.
It's fun to play God.

606
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:47,380
All we had to do was give
them a hundred bucks and...

607
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:48,480
promised them what
was in your house.

608
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,450
I'm starting to like Mexico,
we should get a time share.

609
00:41:50,451 --> 00:41:51,199
Yeah.

610
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,999
Listen, guys. I was
just playing around.

611
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,380
You know?
We're cool, right?

612
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,280
Is this the bad boy
Shane talking or the...

613
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:57,999
snivelling snitch Shane talking?

614
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,750
I've got fifty grand in there.
You guys split it up,

615
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:02,100
that's twenty-five grand a piece
and you walk away, no one...

616
00:42:02,101 --> 00:42:04,150
I was really hoping we could
put Shane on the right track.

617
00:42:04,151 --> 00:42:07,450
I could go really far south.
Like South America or Honduras...

618
00:42:07,451 --> 00:42:08,880
I really didn't want
to be wrong on this.

619
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:10,080
It's okay. You been
wrong plenty of times.

620
00:42:10,081 --> 00:42:10,983
Really?

621
00:42:11,003 --> 00:42:12,003
Okay. Maybe south is bad.

622
00:42:12,004 --> 00:42:13,150
Maybe I'll go up to Canada.

623
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,255
Shane! Can't you see
me and my man...

624
00:42:15,256 --> 00:42:16,680
are having a little family meeting?!

625
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:18,050
Yeah! But I just
wanna ask you...

626
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,680
I need some help here.

627
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,500
Long ride, hot day. Hope
he doesn't die in here.

628
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:32,100
Why's that?

629
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:33,460
Cause I'd like to see
him in the warm...

630
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:34,999
embrace of a whole new family.

631
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,690
Oh, so you're talking
about a guy who wanted...

632
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,280
more than a fast way
out from being a punk?

633
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,350
He's going to spend the
rest of his life in prison...

634
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,650
as the lowest form
of jailhouse bitch.

635
00:42:43,651 --> 00:42:44,575
See that's poetic.

636
00:42:44,576 --> 00:42:45,880
I couldn't have said
that better myself.

637
00:42:45,881 --> 00:42:47,880
Well, then let's go on
to a new subject, playa.

638
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:49,900
Okay. Wanna go
surfing tomorrow?

639
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:27,940
