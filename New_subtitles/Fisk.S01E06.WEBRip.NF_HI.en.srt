00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,840
[birdsong]

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,240
{\an8}I can't keep up, May. Are you eating
gluten or you're not eating gluten?

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,880
{\an8}It's oats. It's no gluten.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,800
{\an8}[Helen] No gluten.
[phone rings]

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,520
I wake up with Today!

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,520
It's for you.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,520
Yeah, it's my phone. Right?

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,520
Hello? Yeah, George, I know.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,920
You texted me last night.
OK. I'll see you at work.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,280
Hey, Graham.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,600
You know, if you want to win money,
you got to register for that thing.

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,280
-They don't just ring random numbers.
-Really?

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,880
-Yeah.
-Well, that's a waste of two years.

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,800
Well, what about that other show,
the, the Cash Cow? How's that work?

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,520
Oh, I think the cow just comes to
your house with a big bag of money.

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,200
-Is that right?
-No, May, I'm kidding.

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,800
-Come on!
-Oh, get out!

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,320
-See ya later, guys. See ya, Artie.
-Bye.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,520
Helen!
Cake in the meeting room at 11.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,920
Yeah, I know. You called me.
And texted.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,640
And invited me to the Facebook event
'Cake at 11'.

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,200
-I'm excited. I got a mud cake.
-Boo. Mud cake.

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
So overrated.
Why didn't you get a fruitcake?

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
We're not in
an old people's home, Helen.

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,480
Rude.

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,040
Oh. Morning, Helen.

27
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,080
Morning, Roz.
Cake at 11 in the meeting room.

28
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,680
-Big announcement.
-Yep. George told me.

29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,960
-Hope you like mud cake.
-Nope. Too wet.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,880
-It's like it's not cooked properly.
-What's that, now?

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,440
I said, "Yep. Yummy.
Cannot wait. Mmm! Delicious."

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,000
My God, she's like a bat.

33
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,320
There we go. There's
an English breakfast. Alrighty!

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,720
Phil! Let's make a will. Go.

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,800
I want to be very prescriptive.
I don't want any fighting.

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,120
Good idea. Sensible.

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,000
So, shall we start
with the fitted sheet sets?

38
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,280
[laughs] Yeah.

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,480
I'm sorry. Yep.
You're serious. Ok. Sure.

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,080
"Fitted sheet set."

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,360
Who's the lucky recipient?

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,080
Forks.

43
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,640
Uh... uh, yes.

44
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,920
[mutters]

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,880
That's the linen cupboard complete.

46
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,800
-Well done us.
-Mmm!

47
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,440
Shall we move on
to the kitchen drawers?

48
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,120
-Mmm?
-Oh! We could...

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,680
The problem is,
coming up to 11, I'm afraid, Phil.

50
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,280
-Oh, really?
-Is that the hour gone already?

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,240
-Mmm.
-There's just so much to get through!

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
-Oh.
-Should we schedule another meet?

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,960
We could, or... I've had an idea.
Grab your stuff.

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,960
Oh.

55
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,920
Here's what I'm thinking.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,960
How about you give me
that little book of yours,

57
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,080
I work from that, and
I give you a call when it's all done?

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,400
-What do you reckon?
-You might miss something.

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,160
Oh, no, I won't. Come on. Give me the
book. And then you pay a flat fee.

60
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,520
Otherwise I've got to charge you
by the hour.

61
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,080
Just... Phil, just let me...

62
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,120
OK. I've got half now, so you
may as well give me the other half.

63
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,680
And I'll tell you what,
you are gonna thank me for that,

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,240
so why don't you get out there,
enjoy all that extra time,

65
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,880
and money, I just saved you?

66
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,360
You're welcome, Phil.
[taps on glass]

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,640
Yeah, I'm coming, Roz. Jesus. I know.

68
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,600
Cake at 11.

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,040
Finally! Ta-da!

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,880
Mud cake! Well done, George.
Great work, Georgie!

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,120
-I'll plate up.
-[Roz] Alright.

72
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,280
Very exciting news.

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,200
We have been nominated
for a Local Business Award.

74
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,760
Great stuff.

75
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,720
I really want to win this one, guys.

76
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,240
Roz is back on deck next month,
and an award

77
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,880
would really help get
the stink of her suspension off us.

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,360
We've bought a table
for the awards dinner.

79
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,800
-And, uh, partners are welcome.
-As are famous fathers.

80
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm looking at you, Fisk. Wouldn't
that stick it up the competition?

81
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,080
Supreme Court judge
on the Gruber table.

82
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,880
-Can I bring someone?
-[Ray] Yes. Bring your girlfriend.

83
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,640
Or your boyfriend.
Which is it, George?

84
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,120
-Ray, you can't ask that.
-[Ray] Why not?

85
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,280
You can. I'm pansexual.

86
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,480
Good! Great!

87
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,680
See? It's fine.
Mmm.

88
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,160
Alright. You bring your dad.
And you can bring Pan.

89
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,480
Let's win this one, guys.
Come on, Team Gruber!

90
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,080
-Team Gruber!
-[Ray] Yes!

91
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,440
-Team Gruber!
-Hey, no, you two.

92
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,480
Mmm. Sit down.

93
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,760
Now, judging is done
by anonymous visit.

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
It could be anyone at any time.

95
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,800
And I want game faces on
24/7, please.

96
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,800
-Oh.
-It's just jokes, Roz.

97
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,280
I was having fun with mud cake.

98
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,080
Thought you didn't like mud cake,
Helen.

99
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,760
Well, it's still cake. I'll eat it.
I mean, God.

100
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,400
Hey, is Roz
really not suspended anymore?

101
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,200
[George] Oh, I don't know.

102
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,600
OK, Petro, go. Talk. What do you
need? What can I do for you?

103
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,160
I believe I'm the illegitimate son
of Georgios Papadakis.

104
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,360
-The newsreader?
-The beloved voice of the nation.

105
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,280
Well, I'm sorry for your loss.

106
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,520
A loss made all the more tragic
by the fact that I never met him.

107
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,560
Did you not just say you're his son?

108
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,960
-I believe that I am.
-Ah. Ok.

109
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,800
So, by any chance, would you be here

110
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,000
to make a claim
on the Papadakis estate?

111
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,720
This is not about the money.

112
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,320
I just want to be acknowledged
as part of the family.

113
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,920
Right. Do you have any proof
you're related?

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,920
Paperwork? A birth certificate?

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,920
I have this.

116
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,240
This is a restraining order
that says you are not allowed

117
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,360
within 50 meters of any member
of the Papadakis family.

118
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,680
That's correct.
It's upsetting for them.

119
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,880
I think because I remind them
so much of Papa Georgios.

120
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,400
It says here it's because you
jumped into the grave at the funeral.

121
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,080
Please. Untrue.

122
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,800
They asked
that family members step forward

123
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,360
and throw some dirt into the hole.

124
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,840
-You mean the grave.
-Yes.

125
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,760
But when I stepped forward,
Yiayia Papadakis,

126
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,400
she screamed and pushed me,
like this, and I fell into the hole.

127
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,960
-Grave.
-Yes.

128
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,520
So you don't want money?

129
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,000
Well?

130
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
Uh, well, I don't not want money.

131
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,720
What makes you think you're related?

132
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
[laughs]

133
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,960
Look at me.

134
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,000
Now look at him.

135
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,560
What do you see?

136
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,760
The future
if I don't stay on top of my waxing.

137
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,960
I can't believe
I never got to meet him.

138
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,800
Have you met your father, Helen?

139
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,960
Yes. Many times.

140
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,000
-Do you cherish that relationship?
-Cherish?

141
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,760
Oh... we text a lot.

142
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,600
But do you tell him
that you love him and cherish him?

143
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
I always send him a thumbs up
or sometimes clapping hands.

144
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,960
Do you know, I think the best thing
to do in this case is a DNA test.

145
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,040
[sighs]
Ok?

146
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,400
-Ok.
-Ok.

147
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,000
I assume you will leave the room.

148
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,760
That would definitely make me
more comfortable.

149
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,240
What?

150
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,560
Uh, is there a, uh, receptacle?

151
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,560
No. We're not doing it now!

152
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,840
And... and we're not gonna do it
from there! Jesus!

153
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,440
The first thing I have to do
is contact the Papadakis family.

154
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,080
Please...

155
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,240
tell them I love 'em.

156
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,360
Yeah. I will send them a thumbs up.

157
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,040
It's not the whole recipe,
'cause Mum won't tell me

158
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,720
everything that's in the marinade.

159
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,040
Georgios Papadakis!

160
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,200
My mum's favorite newsreader!
[laughs]

161
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
-Do you mind?
-Oh, I would be honored.

162
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
Oh, this is outrageous.

163
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,160
Hang on a sec.

164
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,120
Didn't you die?
[camera clicks]

165
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,880
Raymond, do you have a minute?

166
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,400
Make it quick, Roz.

167
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,040
With my reinstatement pending,
what is the plan vis-a-vis Helen?

168
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Staying? Going? Thoughts?
[Ray] Yeah.

169
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,760
I am touching cloth here, Rozzie.
Put a pin in that.

170
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,760
We'll talk about it later.

171
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,920
[clicks mouse]
Are you ready for me, Roz?

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,400
Helen! Good.

173
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,560
-Yep.
-Come, come.

174
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,040
I need to talk to you about
the judging criteria for the awards,

175
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,760
specifically appearance.

176
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,680
Oh, Ok. Yep. Good. Sure.

177
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,240
This one brown suit of yours
you're so attached to.

178
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,960
No, it's not one suit. I've
got three of these, all the same.

179
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,960
-Good God, why?
-It's just easier.

180
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,280
Who can be bothered deciding
what to wear every morning?

181
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,640
Why is it so baggy? Did you
use to be fuller-figured? Plus-size?

182
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,120
-Saying did I use to be fat?
-No.

183
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,040
I'm just wondering, Helen,
if you could, just for once,

184
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,520
be a team player.

185
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,520
Maybe you could jazz it up
or get it taken in.

186
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,600
What about if I wore something loose
but more fashionable?

187
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,520
Don't you dare turn up here
wearing a caftan, Helen.

188
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,680
Ok. And in your mind,
is a caftan the same as a muumuu?

189
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,480
[clicks mouse]
Ok.

190
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,600
muumuu's a no-no. Got it.

191
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,080
No muumuu.

192
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,159
[man] 10 more seconds, Judge.
Stay with it.

193
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,360
Can you go the distance, J-dog?
I know you can.

194
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,920
In three, two, a...

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,440
and one.

196
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,760
Step down. Shake it off.
Good job, guys. Well done.

197
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,680
Sorry, Viktor. I'm a bit early.

198
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,480
-Oh, Christ, Dad. Are you alright?
-Yes, yes.

199
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,800
All well. I just need to, um,
shower off and... towel down.

200
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,840
It's just the after-shakes.
It's good. Means it's working.

201
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,240
-Right. Yeah. Ooh.
-Same time next week, guys?

202
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,880
-Yes, lovely. Thanks, Blayden.
-Yes. Perfect.

203
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,120
You know, actually, I might pop
upstairs for a shower too, I think.

204
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,760
-Not together, Tip.
-Oh, don't be silly.

205
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
[beeping]

206
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,200
Hey! Blayden Tork, T-O-R-K,
Torking Fitness.

207
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,880
-What's your FOC, Helen?
-My what, sorry?

208
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,560
Uh, FOC, fitness of choice.
What's your fitness of choice?

209
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,840
Oh! Um, I walk my dog every day,
so... yeah.

210
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,600
And for fitness?

211
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,080
Um...

212
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,080
when I'm walking my dog,

213
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,640
sometimes if I remember, I clench...

214
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,320
clench my bum, so, um...

215
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,120
so, yeah,
clench walking is my FOC, yeah.

216
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,480
Mm-hm. How about a quick shake
on the Vibratron? Get your buzz on.

217
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,800
Mmm.
Yeah.

218
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,040
-Can you feel the fat melting?
-[voice vibrates] Um...

219
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,400
Ooh. I can definitely
feel it wobbling.

220
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,720
Um! Oh. Egg?

221
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,960
Nah, man. I'm good, thanks.

222
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,280
Blayden Blast protein powder.
Free sample.

223
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,480
No.

224
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,680
Ok.

225
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,000
How long before I'm, like,
thin or whatever?

226
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,600
-Keep going.
-OK.

227
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,240
[loud rattling]

228
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,720
[Anthony] Sorry, what?

229
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,600
I said, I had a bit of a weird day!

230
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,440
I think my job is under review.

231
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,000
Uh, Tip. Tip.

232
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,640
Sorry.

233
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,040
-What was that, Helen?
-I think my job's under review.

234
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,560
I don't know
if they're gonna keep me on.

235
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,120
Well, I guess you'd better
make yourself indispensable.

236
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,520
Mmm! Not a good time
to be unemployed, Helen.

237
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,720
Yeah, I know that. Thanks, Viktor.

238
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,720
Not for you. You're driving.

239
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Is there anything I can do?

240
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,280
Yes.

241
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,840
Could you please
come to the Business Awards night?

242
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,840
My boss would love it if you sat
at our table. He would love it.

243
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,680
-Of course!
-Oh, Helen, don't be silly.

244
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,360
-We'd love to.
-Really?

245
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,000
Thanks, Dad.

246
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
You know, I don't say it enough,
but I... I really...

247
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,040
I cherish you, Dad.

248
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,880
-What?
-You what him?

249
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,320
I cher... I cherish him.

250
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,160
-That's an odd thing to say.
-Is it?

251
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,760
-Do you need money?
-No! I'm being warm and loving.

252
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,960
Aren't I?

253
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,400
It's just making everyone
feel uncomfortable.

254
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,880
Let's eat.

255
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,680
Ok.

256
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,480
I need something smart,
like maybe a nice shirt or...

257
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,880
-Oh, just help yourself.
-What's mine is yours.

258
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,640
Ok. Ooh. Ok.

259
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,960
Did you find something to wear?

260
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,680
I've got that exact same shirt.

261
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,360
No, I did not. Ok.

262
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,120
These are some of my old work suits.

263
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,720
So why don't you see
if one of those fits?

264
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,440
Thanks, May. Great.

265
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,280
Ooh. Alright.

266
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,440
[door opens]

267
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,760
Webmaster! I've come jazzy.
What do you think?

268
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,320
-Nice badge.
-Yeah. It's covering the airline logo.

269
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,480
I'm actually wearing my aunt's
old flight attendant uniform.

270
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,920
Now, I've come up with a plan
about how we can get a DNA sample

271
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,320
from Thomas Papadakis.

272
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Ooh! Me too.

273
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,880
We tempt him
with a delicious glass of Scotch.

274
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,760
And then we sit back and laugh
as he leaves his DNA all over it.

275
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,720
Yeah. I thought I could just ask him
to do a DNA test.

276
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,880
[tapping on glass]
Oh. There's the angry tapper.

277
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,520
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

278
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,800
-Thank you.
-Morning.

279
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,400
Come and give me a hand, you two.
[door closes]

280
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,000
[Roz] Now... from today,

281
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,480
I want every potential mystery judge
to get a goodie bag.

282
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,080
-Ooh! Someone say goodie bags?
-Hey, Ray.

283
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,200
-Let's have a look.
-Good news for you.

284
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,760
Guess who's coming
to the Business Awards.

285
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,160
-My dad.
-Yes! Well done, Fisk.

286
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,760
What have you come as, Fisk?
Is that a Rex Airlines uniform?

287
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,320
I'm being a team player.
You're being a bit silly.

288
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,160
Look. Squishy gavel.

289
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,520
[gavel squeaks]
Ooh! In the tum-tum.

290
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,480
Mr Papadakis. Helen Tudor-Fisk.

291
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,960
Thank you very much for coming in.

292
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,880
I realize this is a difficult time
and I am sorry for your loss.

293
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,200
Goodie bag?

294
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,680
Can I just give you a DNA sample
and get out of here?

295
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,760
-That's what you want, right?
-Wow. Yep. That was easy.

296
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,440
Thing is, my client, Petro Andarakis,
he believes...

297
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,320
Yeah, yeah.
I know what that nutjob believes.

298
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,440
What do you need? Hair? Pubes?

299
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,920
What?
No. I really don't need pubes.

300
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,800
Not sure why everyone thinks DNA has
to come from your pants. It doesn't.

301
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,720
All I need is a couple of these
swabs, run that round your mouth

302
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,680
and then pop it back into the tube.

303
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,800
[door bangs]
Ok. And then...

304
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,760
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

305
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,800
Ok. Or I could pop it back in
for you.

306
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,440
-What's he doing here?
-Oh, oh. Hey, hey, hey. No, no. Crap.

307
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,560
-You can't be here.
-Yassou, brother!

308
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,280
-No.
-Helen told me you might come in.

309
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,120
And I know it's against the rules.
-I'm not your brother.

310
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,920
Seriously,
what's wrong with this guy?

311
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,560
You need to leave, and you should
sit back down. We're not finished.

312
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,760
I just need one more swab from you.
Get out of my way, Ms Tudor-Fisk.

313
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,880
I've bloody had it with this guy.
I'm warning you, mate.

314
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,560
Do you see?
We're like two peas in a pod.

315
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,480
-The fiery temper runs in the family.
-I'm not related to you!

316
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,320
When will you get that
in your thick skull?!

317
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't touch him. Don't grab him!

318
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,360
Does this look like
50 meters to you?

319
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,200
Take a photo of this.
I want evidence for the cops.

320
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,160
Please, Helen, take a picture.
Hey, hey, George. Give me a hand.

321
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,840
Sorry, Helen.
I'm not really a fighter.

322
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,360
-No, Thomas.
-No.

323
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,480
-Thomas!
-No!

324
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,080
-Helen, I'm so sorry.
-No.

325
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,040
Brother, we need to talk! I want to
explain about the funeral debacle.

326
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,720
Uh, please come back later,
when the real staff are here.

327
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,360
We're just temp staff
who work at lunchtime.

328
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,520
What was that?

329
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,280
Just covering us in case
that was the mystery shopper.

330
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,120
[exhales]

331
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Welcome, sir.
May I offer you a goodie bag?

332
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,920
Stand down, George. He's not
the mystery shopper. I guarantee it.

333
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,520
-Hey, Blayden.
-[Blayden] Hey.

334
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,240
You're stretching? Heels and glutes
into the floor. Push it down.

335
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,920
[Blayden] Your dad said you needed
to bring in some new business.

336
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
-So I'm here to get my will done.
-Oh. Good on Dad. Ok.

337
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,200
Well, it's a $500 flat fee...

338
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,240
-500 bucks?!
-... for that, yep.

339
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,800
-Jesus! Are you serious?
-Yeah.

340
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,320
That's what one of
my signature Vibratrons cost.

341
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,000
How can a piece of paper
be worth the same

342
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
as a high-end piece
of wellness apparatus?

343
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,640
Uh, it's fairly standard.
[groans]

344
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,000
In fact, it's pretty cheap.
Yeah. All good. [groans]

345
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,040
Sorry. I think I just need a snack.

346
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,920
-I worked out pretty hard today.
-Mm-hm.

347
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
-You don't have a can of tuna on you?
-Uh, no.

348
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,440
-I don't usually carry a...
-Salmon.

349
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,720
No.
Some almonds? A protein ball?

350
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,320
I might... I might have a lozenge.
Would that be...?

351
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,080
-A protein lozenge?
-No, I don't think that's a thing.

352
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,200
Uh... oh! Ooh, ooh! Hey.

353
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,680
Hey!
Look what I've got.

354
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,200
-Blayden Blast. There you go.
-Blayden Blast. Hey.

355
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,520
Uh, uh, uh, mmm.

356
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,160
[swishes water]

357
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,200
Ugh!

358
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,480
That is the equivalent
of three skinless chicken breasts

359
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,440
and one egg white.

360
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,920
Ooh. All the tasteless white bits.
[snaps fingers]

361
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,960
-Delicious.
-Mm-hm.

362
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,600
I always thought you put it
into the water.

363
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,200
Alright. So the suit's been altered.
Now just got to add some jazz.

364
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,640
The awards are tonight, so...

365
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,160
I do still need to find something
to wear today.

366
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,200
May! Have you seen my grey pants?

367
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,400
-Hey, Webmaster.
-Hey, you look nice.

368
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,040
Thank you.
Bit late, though, don't you reckon?

369
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,840
Oh, mate,
after yesterday, we're fucked.

370
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,760
That's our new slogan, is it?

371
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,320
"Welcome to Gruber & Associates.
We're fucked."

372
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,560
I mean, what if I'd been
the mystery judge?

373
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,720
How did she even hear that?
Is she bionic?

374
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,440
-[Roz] Heard that!
-Oh.

375
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,480
Come on!

376
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,320
Mmm.

377
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,120
Alrighty, Phil, that's for you.

378
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,640
Repaired it.
You'll never even notice.

379
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,760
In case you do, just to show
no hard feelings, that's for you too.

380
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,240
Now, while I'm dealing things out,
let's get you signing.

381
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,960
-Okey-doke. There we go.
-That's a lot of paperwork!

382
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,680
Well, you had
a lot of instructions, Phil.

383
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,160
What's all this going to cost?
It must have taken hours!

384
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,800
-Told you, flat fee.
-Do you mind if I read it?

385
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,599
Yeah, be illegal if you didn't, but
do you mind if I stand up for a bit?

386
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,960
'Cause... oi... I'm wearing old pants
and they are tight.

387
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,319
Oh, did you include
the potato masher?

388
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,839
Check the index.

389
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,920
I added one at the back, in case
you need to cross-check or reference.

390
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,640
I'm just gonna... sit here.

391
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,960
Oh! How are your pants, Phil?

392
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,640
-That's better.
-Oh, I wear mine quite loose.

393
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,520
I... I like sitting.
I... I like to be comfortable.

394
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,280
Yep. I hear you. These used to
fit me, before the divorce.

395
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,720
-Mmm?
-Before I started eating my feelings.

396
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,200
-Hm.
-You know how it is.

397
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,360
Hm.

398
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,760
[sighs]

399
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,720
Ooh! My hibachi's here.

400
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,240
-Delivery for Fisk. Your name?
-Ray.

401
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,000
Ray Gruber.

402
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,040
[door bangs]

403
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,960
"Services rendered"?
What's that about?

404
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,920
[machine vibrates]

405
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Nah, I don't like it.
It's rattling my skeleton.

406
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,600
Here, let me have a go.
You bringing anyone to the awards?

407
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,080
Yeah. My grandma.
She loves to dress up.

408
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,960
You wait till you see
what I'm wearing.

409
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,240
Oh, Roz, Roz! Come and have a go
on the Team Gruber Vibratron. Whoo!

410
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,280
Yes, I heard about
your dodgy contra deal.

411
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,680
You do realize we can get fined
for that sort of thing,

412
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,200
taking payments under the table?

413
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,000
No, it's fine. It's worth 500 bucks.

414
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,640
So I'm gonna pay for it
then gift it to the office.

415
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,360
It does feel weird, but then you get
used to it and it's quite, like...

416
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,080
[makes vibrating noise]

417
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,560
-What did I say?
-What?

418
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,880
I said best behavior from everyone.

419
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,360
I asked you to dress nicely

420
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,840
and then you turn up in fancy dress
as an air hostess.

421
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,960
-What about today? I look really nice!
-Too little, too late.

422
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,640
Apparently, there was a fistfight
in reception the other day?

423
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,560
You don't know... who told you...

424
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,600
-Oh!
-That wasn't my fault.

425
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,080
Fisticuffs! My God, Helen.

426
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,560
And then there was
the salty language

427
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,840
and the rolling around on the floor
in front of a client.

428
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,640
Well, these pants are really tight.

429
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,640
I said to Raymond from the start
you were not a good fit,

430
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,520
and if we lose this award
because of you,

431
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm going to take
this stupid vibrator...

432
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,720
-Excuse me, Roz.
-and I'm going to stick it where...

433
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,440
A courier dropped off
this big body bag thing for you.

434
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,320
Thank you, George.

435
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,960
It's not a vibrator.
It's a Vibratron.

436
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,520
[Roz] I heard that.

437
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,840
Hello, Dad.
[indistinct chatter]

438
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,320
Is this fun Helen?

439
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,480
[laughter]

440
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,280
[man] Can I get a photo of you three?

441
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,280
-Who's the old woman?
-That's Dad's husband.

442
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,080
-That's Viktor.
-No. The lady in the leopard print.

443
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,240
-Oh, that's George's grandmother.
-Oh!

444
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,080
So 'pansexual' doesn't mean
dating old people.

445
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,200
No. Why would it mean... No!

446
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,680
-What?
-Pan?

447
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,960
Pandora? Wasn't she some old woman?

448
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,520
-Oh.
-Oh, hello.

449
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,360
Oh, what have you done, Roz?
[laughs]

450
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,000
This is magical!

451
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,200
-Absolutely wonderful.
-Thank you.

452
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,760
-Well done.
-Thank you very much.

453
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,160
Ah, and I see you've come
in fancy dress again, Helen.

454
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,800
No, this is my brown suit!

455
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,440
I did what you said. I jazzed it up.
I had it altered.

456
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,920
Look at me now.

457
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,560
I don't recall saying turn your suit
into a mariachi band costume.

458
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,800
[dramatic music plays]
Oh, it's starting. It's starting.

459
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,720
-You're sitting over there, Roz.
-Where?

460
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,000
You're not near me.

461
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,360
That's my dad, Roz.

462
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,760
-Oh!
-That's my dad.

463
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,120
Justice Fisk!

464
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,280
Justice Fisk,
what a delight to see you!

465
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,560
Champagne?

466
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,480
[man] Please welcome your master
of ceremonies, Mr Glenn Ridge!

467
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,880
[cheering and applause]

468
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,000
Thank you very much.
That's very kind of you.

469
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,840
Uh, Mr Mayor, distinguished guests,

470
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,600
ladies and gentlemen
and friends beyond the binary,

471
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,560
I'm Glenn Ridge, and
it's certainly great to be with you

472
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,280
as we're coming to you
from the elegant La Mirage ballroom.

473
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,080
I think you'll agree... Yes.
[cheering and applause]

474
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,320
I think you'll agree it's one of
the most versatile function rooms

475
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,600
in outer Melbourne.

476
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,080
There's no doubt about that.

477
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,480
But first the award
for the best wok-based takeaway.

478
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,600
And the nominees are...

479
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,480
... My, My, That's Good Stir-Fry.

480
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,360
[cheering and applause]

481
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,200
Congratulations to all the team
at Rock Your Locks Off hair studio.

482
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,080
A very popular win,
especially with the, uh, seniors,

483
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,280
and I do know that they do love the
Pension Tuesday $60 cut and Colour.

484
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,760
So well done, Antoinette.

485
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,640
Now, moving on
to one of the big awards,

486
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,960
which is
the Professional Services Award,

487
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,440
and, uh, to present this award,
I'm going to hand it over

488
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,000
to one of
our anonymous judging panel,

489
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,640
a man who's going to become
anonymous no more.

490
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,040
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you please welcome Phil Deacon.

491
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,680
[applause]

492
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
Helen, look who it is!

493
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,240
[Helen] I see it, George. Shoosh.

494
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,360
That's it. We're out.

495
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,240
It's the guy whose book you ripped,
remember?

496
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,120
It might be. It might not be.
I haven't got my glasses.

497
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,600
We can't tell from this distance.

498
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,720
-It is.
-Just... just shoosh. Just shoosh.

499
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,880
Myself and the other judges
have spent the past four weeks

500
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,040
visiting the 28 businesses

501
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,240
that nominated themselves
for this award.

502
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
-Helen.
-Shh.

503
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,080
-Hang on, Dad. This is our category.
-Y-y-yes. Of course.

504
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,920
-I might have to leave.
-No, no, no. You can't go.

505
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,800
'Cause if we lose,
they're gonna fire me.

506
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,000
I need you here. I need you here.

507
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,680
-Alright. I'll stay a bit longer.
-Just stay. Ok.

508
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,160
{\an8}Thanks, Dad. Just sit down.

509
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,400
{\an8}-Stop being weird.
-Yes. Good idea.

510
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,520
Uh, the winner of the
Professional Services Award is...

511
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,320
{\an8}Don't make a fuss, Hels, but
I think I'm having a heart attack.

512
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,520
... Pike Probate Services.

513
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,400
Oh, God. Jesus! No, no, Dad!
Dad, Dad, Dad!

514
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,040
[Phil] And collecting the award...

515
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,600
-Oh, God!
-... Alice Pike.

516
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,960
Tony!
[cheering and applause]

517
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,040
-Helen!
-Yep, yep. I'm here, Dad. Yep.

518
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,400
-I cherish you, Helen.
-[sniffs] Oh. I cherish you too, Dad.

519
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah, we all cherish you.
You are cherished, my love.

520
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,920
-I cherish you most of all.
-It's not a competition, Viktor.

521
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,600
You're over-cherishing him.

522
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,120
[tram bell dings]

523
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,640
-Oh, what a night!
-It really was, wasn't it?

524
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,120
All the stars were out last night.

525
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,360
-Fisk!
-Morning.

526
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,720
-[gasps] How's Dad?
-Oh, better.

527
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,000
Out of intensive care,
so that's good. Yep.

528
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,120
-Thoughts and prayers.
-Thank you, Roz.

529
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
-That's very comforting.
-Did we send a goodie bag, Roz?

530
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,440
-Mm-hm.
-Yeah, yeah.

531
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,680
He loved the squishy gavel.
Got a photo.

532
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,880
There we go.
Oh, that's funny.

533
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,400
And the hat. Loving it.

534
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,920
Hey, Roz, I thought about
what you said, and you're right.

535
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,760
I don't think I'm a good fit here.

536
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,160
I know how angry you guys must have
been losing to Alice Pike last night.

537
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,560
Oh, not as angry as Alice Pike was
when she woke up this morning

538
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,760
and saw the front cover
of The Copeland Advocate.

539
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,240
-Have a look at that.
-[Helen] Ethical Business Person? What?

540
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,480
I accepted on your behalf.

541
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,000
Why?

542
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,240
Because you weren't there.

543
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,400
Your father had a heart attack,
remember?

544
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,880
Why did I win it?

545
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,720
Mystery judge Phil said you were a
rare fish in a world full of sharks.

546
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,240
He said you didn't take advantage
of a potentially vulnerable client.

547
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,880
He cited your attention to detail
and, if you can believe it,

548
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,200
your unique ability
to relate to people.

549
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
We did have a very good chat
about pants.

550
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,080
{\an8}-Ta-da!
-George! You got me a fruitcake!

551
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,320
Yep. Old lady cake, just for you,
Helen. Congratulations.

552
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,760
Oh, George,
I was really looking forward

553
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,080
to that gorgeous mud cake.

554
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,480
-Are you kidding? That's not cake.
-[Roz] No.

555
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,600
Alright. Everybody out.
Celebration's over.

556
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,440
Ok. I'll take the cake,
but do I still have a job here?

557
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,920
Well, you did
until you ruined my day.

558
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,600
I was really looking forward
to the mud cake.

559
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,360
[laughs] Ok, it's good jokes,
but do I still have...

560
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,320
Get out, and take your
stupid block of raisins with you.

561
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,000
Ok.

562
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,120
-Straight to Facebook.
-Oh, you did it yourself.

563
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,760
[Helen] Would love to know
if I have a job or not.

564
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
[Roz] You still have a job, Helen!

565
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,640
[Helen] Ok. Mm-hm.

566
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,440
Here we go.

567
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,960
I'm so excited.

568
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,120
-Fingers crossed, eh, Helen?
-Yeah.

569
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,760
Oh.

570
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,800
Petro, I'm sorry.

571
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,360
Georgios Papadakis
is not your father.

572
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,200
Is he my half-father?

573
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,320
That's not a thing.

574
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,480
-Cousin?
-No.

575
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,200
Petro, you're not related
to the Papadakis family at all.

576
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,320
-But I really love those guys.
-Yeah, I know.

577
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,800
And you can still love them.
Just do it from 50 meters away.

578
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,240
Just do it from 150 meters away.

579
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Ok?

580
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,320
Do you want those?

581
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,800
Mmm.

582
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,400
I have a scrapbook.

583
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,440
[machine vibrates]

584
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,480
[beeping]
Oh.

585
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,680
Roz?

586
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,400
Roz, I can't turn it off.
[beeping]

587
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,600
[vibration intensifies]
