1
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,398
Previously on Ghost...

2
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:32,133
- We'll break into his crib.
- Pardon me?

3
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,434
I need every document
he has on me.

4
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:35,202
Effie Morales,
you are under arrest.

5
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,270
What the fuck?

6
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,271
Hey, y'all got
a fucking warrant?

7
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,472
Are you her lawyer?

8
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,274
You're not being arrested
for drug dealing, Effie.

9
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,675
- Then what fucking for?
- Attempted murder.

10
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,711
That's the bitch
that tried to kill me.

11
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,812
You think Weston Holdings

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,347
is a giant Ponzi scheme--
you're right.

13
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:47,548
You guys are fucking criminals.

14
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,216
Remember I know about
your drug business.

15
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,085
You met with Lucas Weston?

16
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:52,753
I also accepted
a campaign donation.

17
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,689
It was him.
He killed papi.

18
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:56,757
Take a look at this.

19
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,626
Now he's gone,
and I ain't got nothing.

20
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,429
If Davis or Cane Tejada
or Tariq St. Patrick

21
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,097
find out
that I'm informing on them,

22
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:04,331
we both know I'm dead.

23
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,499
The feds are building
a RICO case

24
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,567
against you and the Tejadas.

25
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,436
Saxe is a fucking mole. Shit.

26
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:10,738
I found out last night that
Saxe is working with the Feds.

27
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,339
And you just let him walk on
out of here?

28
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,141
I'm worried
it'll fuck with your release.

29
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,509
I have a target on my back.

30
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,212
I'm sorry, but I can't ask
for protection for you now.

31
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:19,680
Theo, put the fucking gun down!

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,615
- It's over.
- Please, for me.

33
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,250
You'll be fine, brother.

34
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,187
We both free now.

35
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,383
I know where Tasha
and Yas are.

36
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:05,586
And if I die,
that information does, too.

37
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,388
This is Davis MacLean.

38
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,223
Please leave a message.

39
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:10,524
Yo, what the fuck?

40
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,892
I called you, like,
1,000 times.

41
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,394
Effie just got roped up.

42
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:14,895
I'm headed to the office now.

43
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,476
Why the fuck
would Saxe have this?

44
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,417
What the fuck you doing here?

45
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,420
Your ex-bitch, Lauren,
that bitch still alive.

46
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,921
Hell, no, nigga, that can't be.

47
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,390
I just saw her
snitch-ass mean mugging Effie

48
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,858
while they put cuffs on her.

49
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,460
You set her up.

50
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,761
Nigga, why the fuck
would I set up Effie

51
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,363
knowing that shit'll
come back on me, Cane?

52
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,432
Because you like acting
like you fucking T'Challa.

53
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,800
But you'll always be the punk

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,802
who let pussy get in the way
of what needed to be done.

55
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:56,804
Listen, my nigga, Lauren wasn't
gonna say shit, all right?

56
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,439
Everything was fine
until your dumb ass

57
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,773
started doing stupid shit.

58
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,941
Effie wouldn't
have got arrested,

59
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,443
and we wouldn't have
a fucking RICO right now.

60
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,777
This is all
your dumb-ass fault.

61
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:04,945
- Dumb-ass fault?
- Yes.

62
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,614
Okay. Fuck you,
because every bad thing

63
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:08,315
that's happened in my family's
been your dumb-ass fault.

64
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,516
You know,
since I met your family,

65
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:10,684
you've been obsessed
with me, and I peep that.

66
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,785
- Okay.
- That's why you fucking

67
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:12,987
with Effie
to try to get back at me.

68
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:14,955
You wanna be me, my nigga.
I understand that.

69
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,790
Listen, you left shorty
in pieces, all right?

70
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,293
I had to pick up those pieces,
so you can't be mad at her

71
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,894
for fucking with a real nigga,
but I appreciate you.

72
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,831
Thank you so much, 'cause you
sure did leave shorty thirsty.

73
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,377
Fuck.

74
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,812
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

75
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,315
Fuck y'all doing?

76
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,416
What the hell is this about?

77
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,684
It's about Effie.

78
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:46,320
- Fuck.
- She got arrested.

79
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,688
The girl we used as bait
for the Feds?

80
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,823
Yeah, I need you
to help her out.

81
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,659
Yeah, she could burn all of us.

82
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,360
All right,
I'll take care of it.

83
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,528
You do that.

84
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,033
Come on.

85
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,810
- You okay, Money Mayweather?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

86
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,345
Sure it's the last thing
you wanna see

87
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:12,680
after last night, though.

88
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,082
That's for sure.

89
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,484
Yeah. Appreciate you
letting me get out of there

90
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,852
before the cops came, too.

91
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,355
Hey, I answered
all their questions.

92
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,524
They know Theo acted
on his own.

93
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,693
I don't think there'll be
any legal fallout

94
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,061
for either of us.

95
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,372
My brother...

96
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:41,375
stupid motherfucker.

97
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,378
Saxe deserved a bullet,
no doubt.

98
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:48,549
But that should have been
my bullet, not Theo's.

99
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,384
I mean, losing
your brother like that,

100
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:52,820
there's no fucking words.

101
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,856
Any luck finding
Tasha's address?

102
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,763
Saxe probably
never even had it.

103
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,499
That rat knew that we were
onto his double-crossing ass.

104
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,067
He probably left
that voice mail

105
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,870
as a-a Hail Mary
to save his ass.

106
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,572
Yeah, he probably did.

107
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,741
I did come across
some shit, though.

108
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,075
Looked like a...

109
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:18,112
like a photo of a police report
signed by Whitman.

110
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:35,429
Did it look like this?

111
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,598
Yeah, that's
exactly how it looked.

112
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:38,766
Fuck.

113
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,968
This is Whitman's case file
on Monet.

114
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,970
Wait. So you stole it
or something?

115
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,772
It was procured
on Monet's behalf.

116
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:47,775
I kept a copy as leverage

117
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:50,444
against her unpredictable,
murdering ass.

118
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,945
Leverage?

119
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,448
It proves Monet
had motive to do dirt.

120
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,950
You don't want to know what.

121
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,953
Now, if Saxe knew I had this,
the Feds know, too.

122
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,790
This could fuck us.

123
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,124
Okay, what are you doing?

124
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,759
Hiding this shit
so it doesn't fuck us.

125
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,860
The Feds ask about Saxe,

126
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,163
you don't know nothing
about him, a'ight?

127
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:11,131
Ain't that the fucking truth.

128
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,800
I better get
on this Effie thing

129
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,201
before the next fucking crisis.

130
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,969
Yeah.

131
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,205
Yeah, that's true.

132
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,647
Aah!

133
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,991
Attorney.

134
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:42,062
Attorney, attorney,
attorney, attorney, attorney.

135
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,832
I need a fucking attorney.

136
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,034
Can y'all hear me now?

137
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,502
Attorney.

138
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,173
Please escort Miss Morales
to holding.

139
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,842
You can call an attorney

140
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,010
when it's your turn
in the phone line.

141
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,012
You're too kind.

142
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:05,118
Well, this isn't working.

143
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,520
I know.

144
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,855
I thought we'd get
through to her by now.

145
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,923
It's been hours.

146
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,863
Oh, it's Medina.

147
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,265
Yeah, me too.

148
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,607
All right, thanks.

149
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,943
NYPD checked
their security cameras.

150
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:38,779
Theo Rollins intercepted Cooper
in the parking lot.

151
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,948
All while Davis
was in his office

152
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,616
with a rock-solid alibi.

153
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:43,884
That's bullshit.

154
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,786
Davis and Rollins
could have planned it that way.

155
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,621
And if they knew Saxe was here,

156
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,290
they probably made him
before we raided the warehouse.

157
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,359
Fuck,
that timeline makes sense.

158
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,762
That's why we came up empty.
He was feeding Saxe bullshit.

159
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,198
I fucking warned him,
the stupid asshole Saxe.

160
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,633
Back the fuck off, Blanca.

161
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,869
Blanca, show some respect.

162
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,171
Saxe was one of us.

163
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,607
Saxe was up to his eyeballs in dirt.

164
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,743
Let's not pretend
that he's some kind of hero.

165
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,145
I mean, how does catching
a bullet wipe his slate clean?

166
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,748
Saxe sacrificed
his life for us.

167
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,017
Without him,
there would be no case.

168
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:20,187
Without his testimony, we lose
a vital link to St. Patrick.

169
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,323
Then give Effie Morales
everything you got.

170
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,325
Recomb through the St. Patrick
and Tejada files

171
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,060
for connections.

172
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,696
If she doesn't flip,
we're fucked.

173
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:48,682
Cane.

174
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,283
Cane!

175
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,918
Cane!

176
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:06,800
You a narc?

177
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,037
What the fuck
are you talking about?

178
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:12,072
You know Lauren was alive?

179
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,975
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Shut the up, my nigga!

180
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,344
Effie covered
for your incompetent ass.

181
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,746
- You was there.
- No, I wasn't.

182
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,384
You really think
I'm stupid, huh?

183
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,219
Okay, when Effie showed up,

184
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,388
she knocked Lauren out
and drove off without me.

185
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:32,325
Whatever the fuck happened that
night is between them, not me!

186
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,795
The Feds roped up
Effie last night.

187
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,897
- Oh, my God.
- Lauren ID'd her.

188
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,231
Fuck!

189
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,233
You got to be
fucking kidding me!

190
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:43,036
What are we gonna do?

191
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,073
I think I need to go
to the hospital first.

192
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,908
Yeah, you do that.

193
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,409
Fucking psycho.

194
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,886
Ma, it's me.

195
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,455
What's that?

196
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,290
A letter
from that lawyer Saxe.

197
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,325
Why would he send you
something?

198
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,494
" Monet, If you're reading
this, that means I'm dead.

199
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,129
"No matter who pulled
the trigger,

200
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,265
"the person I hold responsible
is Tariq St. Patrick.

201
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,267
"Ever since Tariq
came into your life,

202
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,103
"your family's been
falling apart.

203
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,437
"Want to know why?

204
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,306
Tariq has been working
with the Feds."

205
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,941
- Man, fuck outta here.
- Wait.

206
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,442
This is
some lying bullshit, Diana.

207
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,910
You don't know that.

208
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,513
Shit.

209
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,982
Right here Saxe says, "Tariq
set me up to get arrested."

210
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,750
Do you even think
that's possible?

211
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,185
Tariq told me
to have my product

212
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,253
in the lockers on the roof.

213
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,122
That's why they came after me.

214
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,890
Well, shit, we better
not do anything

215
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,958
till we know for sure.

216
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,826
This could be
a fucking setup, D.

217
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,128
Go do what you do.

218
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,797
Find out what you
need to find out.

219
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,966
A'ight, bet.

220
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,805
What the fuck happened to you?

221
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,306
Cane went fucking Suge Knight
on my ass

222
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,176
'cause he found out Lauren was
alive and Effie got arrested.

223
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,777
He thinks I'm up to it.

224
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,812
Yeah, me and him
was just throwing hands

225
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,313
at Davis' office
about the same shit.

226
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,315
But why? I get why he came
for me, but you?

227
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,383
Look, I don't know man.

228
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,885
You know Cane.
That nigga's crazy.

229
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,488
You knew.

230
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,490
You knew about Lauren.

231
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,058
That's how you knew Effie
and I were behind it.

232
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,927
I mean, yeah, I knew
about fucking Lauren, bro.

233
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,395
But why the fuck would I tell
the motherfuckers

234
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,497
that just tried to take her out
that she's still alive?

235
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,899
'Riq, I tried to save Lauren.

236
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,834
How many times do I have
to tell you that?

237
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,335
Now Effie got arrested,
and you know her.

238
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,937
She only cares
about number one.

239
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,405
Yeah, that's why we need to be
careful with our next move.

240
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,873
'Riq, there is no fucking
next move.

241
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,009
After that shit you pulled
with CrashCoin and the Feds?

242
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,277
Bye-bye, Weston Holdings.

243
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,379
Bro, the shit needed
to be done, all right?

244
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,181
Stop bitching about it.

245
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,416
Tell Obi that we're not gonna
make the quota for now

246
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,885
so he doesn't merc our ass.

247
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,487
Okay. How?

248
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,189
All right, fine, I'll do it,

249
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,024
but do something, bro.

250
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,292
Keep your eyes
on Weston Holdings.

251
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,459
Do something.

252
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,028
'Riq, can I please just have
one day off?

253
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,429
Just one, okay?

254
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,598
Me, my Xbox, and some Twitch
babes in a hot tub, just once.

255
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,366
Listen, I understand
you're in pain, bro.

256
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,869
But what the fuck happens
when your shady-ass uncle

257
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,537
pulls a moves to back us
out of our deal?

258
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,206
What the fuck do we do then?

259
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,874
Fine.

260
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,376
When I'm discharged,
I'll go see him.

261
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,878
You are discharged.

262
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,479
Just a little scratch.
You'll be fine.

263
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,901
Lauren, why you ghosting me?

264
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,069
Effie got roped up.

265
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,637
Are the Feds coming
for the rest of us?

266
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,107
I need you to let me know.
Hit me back ASAP.

267
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,447
Where's Dru?

268
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,148
Hello to you, too, Evelyn.

269
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,985
Dru ain't here.
What do you wanna talk about?

270
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,420
There's a video
of Dru floating around.

271
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,322
Know anything about that?

272
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,659
- Do I look like I'm on YouTube?
- Stop lying, bitch.

273
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,527
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

274
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:57,464
Cut the bullshit.
I saw the video.

275
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,167
It was a confession.

276
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,435
Look, Dru already told you

277
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,671
he don't know
what happened to Gordo.

278
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,339
I know you took Frank from me.

279
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,341
- You admitted that.
- I didn't admit shit.

280
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,310
I told you what Lorenzo wanted.

281
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,012
And now Lorenzo's dead.

282
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,446
Yes, he is.

283
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,582
You saying you had something
to do with that?

284
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,450
You know I didn't.

285
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,154
I told you I didn't want a war
with the Tejadas.

286
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,290
I told you that!

287
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,459
But you don't even seem
to be grieving him.

288
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,395
Why the fuck are
you here, Evelyn?

289
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:35,135
I'm coming to you as a mother.

290
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,304
My Gordo is missing.

291
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,142
I don't know
whether he's dead or alive,

292
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,311
somewhere needing my help.

293
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,980
Can you imagine that?

294
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,715
I don't know what to tell you.

295
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,151
Stop. Just stop.

296
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:55,655
Forget the rules of this
fucking game for one second.

297
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,624
What if this was your son?

298
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:07,000
I just wanna know
what happened.

299
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,401
I just--Can you help me?

300
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,402
Look...

301
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,173
I had no beef with Gordo.

302
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:16,209
Last time I checked,
him and Dru were good.

303
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:20,046
I granted you grace for Frank.

304
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:24,351
But I promise
you will not get away

305
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,419
with taking my son from me.

306
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,522
"Granted"?

307
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,124
"Grace"?

308
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,059
"Get away"?

309
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:38,031
Sounds like a fucking threat
to me, Evelyn.

310
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,300
And I'm sure
you don't wanna do that.

311
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,035
Evelyn.

312
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,626
Fuck.
They know Dru killed Gordo.

313
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,462
That's the last fucking thing
we need.

314
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:17,237
They're not gonna stop
till they find you.

315
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:20,073
This is my mess.

316
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,608
I'ma handle it.

317
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,178
We gotta take 'em out.

318
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,547
All of them.

319
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:31,518
Whatever you do, just make sure
this doesn't come back on us.

320
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,756
Look, we just--we got heat
on us right now, all right?

321
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,658
We gotta stop the Wall Street
operation for now.

322
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:43,263
But our other distro--

323
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,431
What the fuck?

324
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,566
Our other distros
are solid, all right?

325
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,834
For now.

326
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,437
It is not
your first misstep, Tariq.

327
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:54,140
Ajebutter playing at gangster.

328
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,242
Look, I don't want you
at my neck.

329
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,444
I just need some extra time,

330
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,312
and I promise the quota
will be met.

331
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:04,117
Why would I deny myself
the pleasure

332
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,286
of watching Noma kill you?

333
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:09,556
I'm hoping she makes it slow,
really takes her time.

334
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,624
Listen, man, whatever it is
that you need,

335
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,326
I can get it for you, a'ight?

336
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,295
I promise.

337
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:18,131
What I need only
Noma can get me.

338
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,466
What makes you so sure?

339
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:22,302
You know how of much of a
resourceful motherfucker I am.

340
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,471
Shh, shh, shh.

341
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:27,507
Let me go!

342
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,156
Her influence is the only way
my family in Nigeria

343
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,757
can get green cards.

344
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,794
Why would I betray her
to help you?

345
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:48,862
Because I know what it's like

346
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,497
to want your family
so fucking bad

347
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:51,831
that you'll do
whatever it takes

348
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,666
to get to them, all right?

349
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,635
Look, if I get you
these green cards,

350
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,838
will you please stall Noma out
for me?

351
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,813
You have 72 hours.

352
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,349
Thank you.

353
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:16,856
So them green cards

354
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,458
is payment
for boosting your numbers.

355
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,360
Yeah, yeah, the boost helped,

356
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,196
but the raid on the Russians
didn't put me over AVH.

357
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,597
Sounds like a you problem.

358
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,633
Not if my continued association
with you

359
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,368
puts my campaign at risk.

360
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,569
Yeah.

361
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,337
So I'm gonna need
a bigger bite of the apple,

362
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,639
- my young brother.
- What do you mean?

363
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,874
I'm giving you
five bands a week, come on.

364
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,910
Yet you're still fucking
holding out on me, Tariq.

365
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,512
Come on, man.

366
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,682
There's rumors that
Weston Holdings is doing dirt.

367
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,284
You know anything about that?

368
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,587
I mean, they on the up-and-up.

369
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,889
Who told you that?

370
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:53,726
You know, you hear things
here and there.

371
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:57,564
Look, man, the Westons
wanna put me on a payroll,

372
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,399
and I need to know
what I'm working with

373
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:00,667
before I can agree to anything.

374
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,901
Do you understand
what I'm dealing with?

375
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,403
- Yeah.
- Okay.

376
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,238
Well, if you know something,
then fucking tell me.

377
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,740
Look, trust me,
Weston Holdings is legit.

378
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,908
All right?

379
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,911
You gonna give me
these green cards or what?

380
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,247
I'll see what I can do.

381
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,615
Thank you.

382
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,919
Lying motherfucker.

383
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,255
Hello?

384
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,591
Hey, Harp, you finally
answered--thank you.

385
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:27,260
Listen, I know
you've been avoiding me, babe,

386
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,462
but please just hear me out.

387
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,432
So I told Rashad
about what you do, Herb,

388
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,700
and he did some digging.

389
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,001
I have a contact
at Weston Holdings

390
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,603
I've known for a long time.

391
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:39,005
The kid is a lying liar
who lies just like his father.

392
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,540
I can read him like a book.

393
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,275
Now, he insists
they're on the up-and-up.

394
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,944
So I have a hunch
there's something wrong there.

395
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,613
I'd say you have
good instincts.

396
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,281
I've been watching
Weston Holdings

397
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,449
for a while now.

398
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,917
The numbers just don't add up.

399
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,953
Well, how have their activities
gone unnoticed by the SEC?

400
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,622
Powerful lobbying.

401
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,790
Frankly, I'd say that
they paid the right person

402
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,926
to look the other way.

403
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,261
Like Congressman
Rick fucking Sweeney.

404
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,796
That would explain
why my many letters

405
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,431
have gone
completely unanswered.

406
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,966
Look, I have the evidence,

407
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,802
and no one will listen
to what I have to say.

408
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,537
Until now.

409
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:15,308
With me behind you,
they'll have to listen.

410
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,709
I'd be a fool
if I didn't recognize

411
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,978
your motivations here, Councilman.

412
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,313
You think this might be

413
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:22,582
a winning issue
for your campaign.

414
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:25,418
Taking down Wall Street
on behalf of Main Street

415
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,987
ain't a bad look,

416
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,990
but it's also
the right thing to do.

417
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,493
This could be dangerous, Rashad.

418
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,495
Are you sure?

419
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:36,863
Of course.

420
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,500
Okay.

421
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:53,880
I don't need
Tariq's help, okay?

422
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,014
You're wasting your time.

423
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,849
Cane asked me to come as well.

424
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:00,853
Given the circumstances,
hear me out.

425
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,931
If they charge you, you'll
be facing attempted murder.

426
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,700
Most likely lose and get time.

427
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,835
Question is, how much?

428
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,371
Normally I avoid no-win cases,

429
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,807
but we're all on the line here.

430
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:24,010
"No-win"?
That's your pitch?

431
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,546
You'd rather I sugarcoat it?

432
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,715
I'd rather someone
go to bat for me.

433
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:30,850
Smelling like
the bottom of a bottle,

434
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,552
I'm not so sure you're it.

435
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:38,024
If you don't like a gift horse,
I can give you a referral.

436
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,426
I have someone, but some bitch
keeps cutting in front of me

437
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:41,427
in the phone line.

438
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,029
Can't contact them.

439
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,031
And the, uh, deputies
let it happen?

440
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:48,434
They say they don't see it,
but they're lying.

441
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:49,769
Then they're in on it--

442
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:52,638
a tactic they use to, uh,
pressure you into cooperating.

443
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,407
That's not illegal?

444
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:58,411
It's unethical
but legal as fuck.

445
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:01,481
Tell you what--I'll have a word
with the captain on my way out.

446
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:06,018
My, uh, parting gift.

447
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,755
Thanks.

448
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,093
Does Tariq--

449
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,965
Never mind.

450
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,772
Stay calm. Stay calm.

451
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:30,109
It's all gonna work out.
Stay calm.

452
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,612
- What's going on?
- Not here.

453
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,814
Not here.

454
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:37,583
Everyone, let's give
the agents some space.

455
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,453
Conference room, now.

456
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,965
Why are we being accused
of running a Ponzi scheme?

457
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:54,801
- It's not possible.
- I don't know.

458
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,869
All I know is
that when the agents showed up,

459
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,070
Uncle Lucas just dipped.

460
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,739
Which one of you
snitched to the SEC?

461
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:02,208
Nobody snitched, all right?
We made a deal with Lucas.

462
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,810
Where is he anyway?

463
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,778
God, he slipped out.

464
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,446
Left me to hang.

465
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,183
You're not gonna
turn me in, right?

466
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:11,818
That depends.

467
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,653
Did you have an escape plan
with Lucas

468
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,121
in case shit went sideways?

469
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:18,891
If we did, trust me, this isn't
the way it was supposed to go.

470
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,860
- I wanna know.
- Dad, they don't know shit.

471
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,162
Keke, where the hell is Lucas?

472
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,464
I-I don't know, Robert.

473
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,966
I'm in the dark
just as much as you are.

474
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,502
Oh, bullshit.
I know you two were fucking.

475
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,571
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

476
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,139
Trace is an idiot.
This is Lucas' fault.

477
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:37,243
I know because I saw
something off in the books.

478
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,745
So these accusations are real?

479
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:40,913
Yeah.

480
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,516
When I asked Uncle Lucas
about the discrepancy,

481
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:45,117
he said that he
would handle it,

482
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:49,188
but he made me swear not
to tell anyone, not even Keke.

483
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,790
She's telling the truth.

484
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,700
Oh, dear God.

485
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,201
We're gonna have
to call the lawyers

486
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,703
and the board of directors.

487
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,872
We need to find Lucas.

488
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:09,976
Fuck you.

489
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:16,883
Agent Young reported back.

490
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:20,620
He thinks if we use
the interview surveillance,

491
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,521
it might spook him.

492
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,856
That's dicey territory.

493
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,092
I'm nervous to play
our hand that way.

494
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,733
It's from Saxe.

495
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,568
What? How?

496
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:41,574
"Dear Jenny,
so that happened.

497
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,576
"Tough break, huh?

498
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,077
"This isn't your fault.

499
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:48,114
"I knew what I was getting into
when I agreed to help you.

500
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:52,752
"I arranged for this in case
something like this happened.

501
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:55,588
"There's so many things I wish
I could have said to you.

502
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:57,590
"I realized pretty late
in my life

503
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,761
"how much I wanted
my own family with you.

504
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:05,932
"It wasn't just the sex,
but it wasn't not the sex.

505
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:07,767
"I also had feelings.

506
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:11,103
"And as much as you tried to
deny it, I know you did, too.

507
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:14,106
"So my last gift to you
is freedom.

508
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,609
"Let the white whale go.

509
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:19,278
"I won't let it take you down
like it did me,

510
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,281
"because from where I am now,

511
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:26,719
I can play just as dirty
as they do."

512
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,288
So you two really were...

513
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,297
But I'm not letting
this fucking go.

514
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:41,133
I'm gonna bury Davis,
the Tejadas, and Tariq,

515
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,769
every single one
of those fuckers.

516
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:47,073
- Shit.
- Davis.

517
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:48,941
I'm busy.

518
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,810
We have an offer
for your client.

519
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,645
Ms. Morales
declined my services.

520
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,347
Smart, since you
would've conflicted out.

521
00:26:54,347 --> 00:26:56,816
You should really think
about making a deal with us.

522
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:59,051
We know you asked Saxe to pay
off a member of the parole board

523
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,353
to get Theo Rollins
released early.

524
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:02,688
I had no knowledge
of a payoff, okay?

525
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,824
But getting Saxe to help
my brother

526
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,325
certainly didn't work out
for Theo.

527
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,728
Saxe would still be here
without Theo.

528
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:11,330
And whose fucking fault
is that, huh?

529
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,232
I don't know why Theo
did what he did.

530
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:16,635
Talk to the NYPD.
They know I'm not responsible.

531
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,671
See, I'm not so sure
about that.

532
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,172
We reviewed
the surveillance footage

533
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:23,409
of you and Saxe meeting
with Diana Tejada.

534
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,977
From the attorney's room?

535
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,178
Nice.

536
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:27,713
That violates privilege.

537
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,849
Not if you don't record audio.

538
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,984
Do you recall the meeting?

539
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,821
We talked to our client
and left.

540
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,957
How about when you spilled
coffee on Saxe?

541
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:40,726
'Cause it looked like
you slipped Diana a note.

542
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:47,433
I don't recall.

543
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,869
See, we think
you made Saxe as our CI,

544
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:52,671
and you fed Diana false
information to give Saxe.

545
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,075
Then you had Theo, who already
took the weight once for you,

546
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,243
kill Saxe.

547
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:58,811
What'd he have to lose, right?

548
00:27:58,811 --> 00:27:59,912
He was dying anyway.

549
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,881
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

550
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:03,382
You may not have pulled
the trigger,

551
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:05,051
but Saxe's blood
is on your hands.

552
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,053
I dare you to take that
to a grand jury

553
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,955
after I sue the fuck out of you
for harassment.

554
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:14,060
If you're looking for someone
to blame Saxe's death on,

555
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,462
look in the fucking mirror.

556
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,269
You think RSJ blew the whistle?

557
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:26,305
I don't know. I think
he just wanted his money.

558
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,074
But we only got one option, B.

559
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:29,909
Gotta find Uncle Lucas
and take him out.

560
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:31,744
- He gotta go.
- Okay, wait. What?

561
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:33,012
We're not killing
my uncle, 'Riq.

562
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:34,246
It's the only way.

563
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,015
Didn't you say that family
was more important

564
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,149
than drugs and money?

565
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,350
I can't do that to my family.

566
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,785
All right, but what
about my family, huh?

567
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,253
My trust fund
would've covered them

568
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,788
when they got out of WITSEC.

569
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:44,323
Now that shit is gone
'cause of your fucking uncle.

570
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:45,925
So now what?

571
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:48,828
Listen, he has nothing left
to lose, Brayden, all right?

572
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:50,763
And you know he'll rat
on our fucking operation

573
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,198
to cover his dirty ass.

574
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:53,732
Now you freezing up.

575
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,067
Listen, bro, you chose
to live this life!

576
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,769
Now live by the fucking rules
one time!

577
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:58,170
- Here we go.
- Please, bro!

578
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,106
Here we go with that "one foot
in one foot out" bullshit.

579
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:02,942
So what the fuck is it?
What is it, bro? What is it?

580
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,376
I don't want
to end up like you.

581
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,246
What the fuck
do you mean by that?

582
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,116
Listen, 'Riq,
I saw you change, okay?

583
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:12,451
That person that I met
at Choate a few years ago,

584
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,819
that's not who you are anymore.

585
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,321
All right.
I went through life.

586
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:17,289
I grew up, bro.
I had no fucking choice.

587
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,091
Yeah, I know
it's not your fault,

588
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,926
but I-I just don't want
to be able to knife Bash

589
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,128
and act like it's no big--

590
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:23,896
Listen, I kill
because I fucking have to!

591
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,131
To protect us!

592
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:27,166
You hear that?
Us, bro!

593
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,301
I don't want to be someone who
could kill their own father.

594
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,137
I never said I fucking did
that shit, all right?

595
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,938
Shut the fuck up saying that.

596
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,340
You didn't have to.

597
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,476
I'm just being real
with you, 'Riq.

598
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:39,311
There's no being real
with you, my nigga.

599
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,313
You a hypocrite.

600
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,849
I need to know one thing
from you, and that's it.

601
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,818
Are you gonna step up
for this family?

602
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,319
Because that's
what you called it.

603
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:50,156
So what are you gonna
do for this family?

604
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,325
Even if I wanted to,

605
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,261
I don't even know where
the fuck Lucas is--he's AWOL.

606
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:56,996
You got access
to your family's properties,

607
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:58,864
the money,
and all of the a-fucking-bove.

608
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:00,332
Find him and take him out,

609
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:03,002
because it's either him or us,
all right?

610
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,013
Our assets are frozen?

611
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:17,016
Whoa, how the fuck
do our personal finances

612
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:18,884
fall under SEC's purview?

613
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:20,352
There's talk
of criminal charges.

614
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:22,521
- Against who?
- Us.

615
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:25,591
If they did it to the Madoffs,
they can do it to the Westons.

616
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,161
Robert, if there was ever
a time to let Lucas hang,

617
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,329
it's now.

618
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,064
You've been willfully blind
long enough.

619
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,033
You said everyone loves Lucas.

620
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,334
You act
like you wanna fuck him.

621
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,569
- Come on.
- That's disgusting.

622
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,204
That was the Klonopin talking.

623
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:40,306
Oh, just Klonopin, Mom?

624
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:41,373
Not now.

625
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:43,409
No, Dad.
Mom's right.

626
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:45,978
Fuck Uncle Lucas.
He left us holding the bag.

627
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:47,947
Yeah, and we have no idea
where he is?

628
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:48,948
Nope.

629
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:50,216
Mom sent me to his apartment,

630
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:51,884
thinking Uncle Lucas
would open the door

631
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:53,586
with some emotional blackmail
from his favorite niece.

632
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:54,887
You mean his only niece?

633
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,555
Okay, the place was empty

634
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:59,558
like he planned on leaving
for a while.

635
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,260
I mean, can't we track
his spending?

636
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,394
His accounts are linked

637
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,063
to Weston Holdings
anyways, right?

638
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,198
Nope. No, that's the best part.

639
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:09,468
Our dear Uncle Lucas has been
moving money for weeks.

640
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,170
You know, small transactions,

641
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,939
so undetected,
but totaling several mil.

642
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:16,242
He's probably partying it up
in the fucking Maldives,

643
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:17,476
for all we know.

644
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,211
Nothing's been proven
against him.

645
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,279
Wake the fuck up, Robert!

646
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,347
He's running
because he's guilty!

647
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:22,648
He's still my brother!

648
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,483
I can't just throw him
under the bus!

649
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,585
Well, I'd do it to Skids
in a heartbeat.

650
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,654
Ah! Trace,
I swear to fucking God.

651
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,222
Hey!

652
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,658
Who the fuck is that?

653
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,293
What now?

654
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,535
Can I help you?

655
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:46,038
Yeah, we're looking
for Robert Weston.

656
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,674
Sir, we'd like to ask you
a few questions.

657
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,376
We have an escort.

658
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:54,446
I'll have my attorney
meet us there.

659
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,615
Lead the way.

660
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,285
Dad, you don't have to do this.

661
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:02,288
If not me, then who?

662
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:08,460
Brayden, sometimes
doing the hard thing

663
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,262
is the only thing we can do.

664
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,179
You're all gonna want
to hear this.

665
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,650
Hello, you still there,
Mr. Weston?

666
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,352
Yeah, I'm still here,
Agent Medina.

667
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,421
Please call me Lucas.

668
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:37,156
All right,
I've looped my team in.

669
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:38,390
Go ahead.

670
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,958
Well, my attorneys
have informed me

671
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,161
that the SEC is investigating
a Ponzi scheme

672
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:43,429
at Weston Holdings.

673
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:45,097
They seem to think
I've gone on the run

674
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:46,632
because I had something
to do with the Ponzi,

675
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,167
but that's not it at all.

676
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:51,003
So you went into hiding
because you're afraid

677
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:54,173
the person responsible
is gonna come after you?

678
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:55,407
Well, not just them.

679
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:58,243
You see, the thing is...

680
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:01,180
not only do I know
who's behind the Ponzi,

681
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,183
but I-I also have intel
on a drug ring

682
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:05,684
operating
within Weston Holdings.

683
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,720
And when I reached out
to the DEA, they--they told me

684
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,055
you were the agents
I should be in touch with.

685
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:13,092
We are.
What'd you have in mind?

686
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,693
Protection and immunity

687
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:17,629
from these false
Ponzi scheme allegations.

688
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,567
This fucking scumbag's lying.

689
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:25,137
Lucas and Robert Weston are
at the top of the food chain.

690
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:26,472
He's involved.

691
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,474
Even so, his intel
could be the evidence

692
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,743
we need for your RICO case.

693
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:33,612
Lucas, this is

694
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,481
Assistant District Attorney
Jenny Sullivan.

695
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,549
If you want me to cut through
red tape for immunity,

696
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:40,719
I'm gonna need a taste before
we can agree to anything.

697
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,554
Look into CrashCoin.

698
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:44,256
I'll be in touch.

699
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:53,232
If Lucas' intel pans out,
we get the whole drug network.

700
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:55,401
Now we just need someone
to flip on the bodies.

701
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:58,237
If we tell Effie that we're
taking down the drug ring

702
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:02,241
and offer her a lifeline
if she flips on the murders.

703
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,778
What's with the luggage?

704
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:08,080
Unlike you,
I don't have lawyers, liquid,

705
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,582
or white privilege to protect
me, so I just--I have to go.

706
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,151
Running is my best option.

707
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,086
For how long?
A year?

708
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:15,087
Ten?

709
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:16,388
Is this what you want?

710
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,589
Yes, Brayden.

711
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,258
All the sacrifices
that my parents made

712
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:21,427
to send me to school, what,
so I can go hide in Toronto,

713
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:23,695
work at a McDonald's with a
fucking bull's-eye on my back?

714
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,131
- I'm serious, Keke.
- I am too.

715
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:28,400
Look, my parents
are good people.

716
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,835
- You're a good person.
- I'm not.

717
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,438
I'm literally a part
of a fucking Ponzi.

718
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:36,208
I'll be crucified
once this gets out.

719
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,776
Okay, then why get involved
in the first place?

720
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:40,112
Look, when I started, Lucas,

721
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:42,714
he--he's the only one
that believed in me, okay?

722
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:45,350
He--he listened.
He treated me like an equal.

723
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,119
But he was
just fucking using me.

724
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,620
Okay, so then why protect him?

725
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,789
If you don't turn him in,
he's gonna turn you in first.

726
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:54,793
Look, even if I knew where he
was, I'd have to come forward.

727
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:58,297
I can't fucking do that
to my parents.

728
00:34:58,297 --> 00:34:59,631
If I make this all go away

729
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,800
without letting anyone know
you were a part of it,

730
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,502
will you tell me?

731
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:08,307
I promise I won't betray you
like he did.

732
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:10,809
How are you gonna do that?

733
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,578
You just trust me.

734
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:14,746
Please.

735
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,388
Mami, ¿qué te pasa?

736
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,892
What the fuck?

737
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,460
- Guillermo, watch her.
- Oh, my God!

738
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,728
Gustavo.

739
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:40,299
Open the door!

740
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:43,902
Hurry up!

741
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,911
It's locked.

742
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,014
I'm so sorry.

743
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:06,818
Gordo...

744
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:09,488
I'm sorry.
I didn't have a choice.

745
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:11,690
It was your mother.

746
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:17,329
She wanted Lorenzo dead.

747
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,997
It was Monet.

748
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:27,005
No.

749
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:38,650
All good?

750
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,524
Yeah.

751
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,659
She say anything?

752
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:17,789
Yo.

753
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:19,424
I've been texting and calling.

754
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,059
Haven't heard from you
since I got out.

755
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,894
Yeah, I know.
I've been dealing with a lot.

756
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,563
- What's up?
- You tell me.

757
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:27,065
I got arrested because you
told me to use the lockers.

758
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,901
Ah, look, I ain't know
there was cameras up there.

759
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,070
I ain't been up there in,
like, a whole semester.

760
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,139
Then why the fuck would you
send me up there, Tariq?

761
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,408
Because you needed help.
You know Stansfield is hot.

762
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:38,443
You gotta do your
due diligence--come on, now.

763
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:39,678
That ain't fair.

764
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:42,447
Noma has a photo of me.
My family needed me.

765
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:44,916
Listen, Noma had a picture
of me and my family as well, D.

766
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:47,085
That's why when I figured out
Saxe was a CI,

767
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:50,388
I put together a plan,
and I protected you.

768
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,990
So you're not working
with the Feds?

769
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,926
Did you just ask
if I was working

770
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:56,094
with the fucking Feds, D?

771
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,929
After what they did
to me and my mother,

772
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,931
you really think I would
fucking work with the Feds?

773
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,666
You're bugging.

774
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,401
- I'm sorry.
- What the fuck, yo?

775
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,770
I said I'm sorry.

776
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,938
Look, Monet just got my head
all fucked up.

777
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:09,541
I need to get away from her
and get out the life.

778
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:13,812
'Riq, can you just
slow down for a second?

779
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:17,582
If I transfer outta state,
where would that leave us?

780
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,021
Look, just put yourself first,
all right?

781
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,824
- After this Effie shit--
- I'm not Effie.

782
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:27,959
I know that,
but it doesn't matter.

783
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:30,629
I just--I don't have it in
me no more,

784
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,964
and I really need
to take this call, D.

785
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:37,869
Okay.

786
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:44,042
- Yo.
- When were you gonna tell me

787
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:46,611
that Rashad Tate
blew the whistle to the SEC?

788
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,513
Wait. Tate did what?

789
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:51,216
Fuck. All right, I'ma fix it,
I promise.

790
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,651
You better.

791
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,120
Shit.

792
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:34,025
Come on.

793
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:57,215
"Lorenzo Tejada"?

794
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,657
Why would papi's prints be
at the scene of Zeke's murder?

795
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07,792
Papi told Monet IG killed Zeke.

796
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,629
Uh, hello?
I'm talking to you, Dru.

797
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:13,265
Could papi have had something
to do with Zeke's murder?

798
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:15,267
What? No, absolutely not.

799
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:17,569
But it would explain
the prints.

800
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:19,938
And if Monet found out
about it, then--

801
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:21,740
How, Dru? From who?

802
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:25,076
Fucking Tariq.

803
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,279
Why else would he have
that file?

804
00:42:29,114 --> 00:42:33,251
Yo, Tariq told Monet
about papi,

805
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:35,253
and then she gets Gordo
all wound up

806
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:38,089
and convinces him
that papi is responsible

807
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,157
for Uncle Frank's murder.

808
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:41,927
Evelyn said Monet
wanted Lorenzo dead.

809
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:45,063
Monet is fucked up, okay?

810
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,332
But that's a lot even for her.

811
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,134
Dru, you said it yourself.

812
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:51,670
Papi told Monet IG killed Zeke.

813
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,305
She didn't believe him.

814
00:42:54,806 --> 00:42:56,775
She knew it was a lie.

815
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:59,277
- What the fuck, Cane?
- You fucking knew.

816
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:01,346
That's why papi
let you call the shots,

817
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,648
'cause you knew he killed Zeke.

818
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:05,116
But why the fuck
would papi kill Zeke?

819
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:06,151
That doesn't make sense.

820
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:07,919
It was a mistake, all right?

821
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,821
He thought
he was shooting Mecca.

822
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:15,593
And you think Monet
had papi killed?

823
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,295
I thought it was
a real fucking possibility.

824
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:20,131
When I brought it up to her,
she threatened to kill me.

825
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:23,802
And if she'd kill Cane...

826
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:26,871
Dru, what's stopping her
from killing us, too?

827
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:44,122
Hey, I knew y'all was coming,
I'd have ordered more food.

828
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,223
What's up?

829
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:47,692
We know
about papi's fingerprints.

830
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:49,127
What fingerprints?

831
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,329
See, that's that lying
bullshit again.

832
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:54,332
What the fuck is wrong
with you, Dru?

833
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:56,201
I fucking killed Gordo for you.

834
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:58,837
I killed the entire
Castillo family for you,

835
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:02,907
all so you can lie to my face
about who killed papi.

836
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:04,409
It was Kai and Gordo.

837
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,244
Shut the fuck up!

838
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:08,179
I'm so done with your lying
bullshit, Monet!

839
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:09,914
Uh-uh, Dru.
You shut the fuck up.

840
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:11,149
This is my fucking house.

841
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,351
- What the fuck, Cane?
- Don't, okay?

842
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:15,353
'Cause part of me
never wanted to believe

843
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:17,989
you was evil enough
to kill our father.

844
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,424
But why not?

845
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,359
You're fucked up.

846
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,696
I've lied, stole,
dropped bodies for you, Monet.

847
00:44:24,696 --> 00:44:27,198
I've done everything you wanted
me to do, and what you do, huh?

848
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:29,334
Turn your back on me
for this nigga Tariq?

849
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:30,335
You really let this nigga
walk in here

850
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,670
and ruin our fuckin' life?

851
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,439
That's what
this is all about--Tariq?

852
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,275
- He feeding you all these lies?
- Ma, this ain't about Tariq.

853
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:38,943
You know it's the truth.

854
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:43,048
Well, so,
if this is the truth...

855
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:45,717
that means y'all giving Lorenzo
a pass for killing Zeke?

856
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:47,252
It was an accident.
You should know that--

857
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:49,921
How the fuck you know
it was a accident?

858
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,723
Your papi ain't even want you
in the house

859
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:53,124
because he knew
you was a nosy bitch.

860
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:55,060
And he didn't send you
to Stansfield

861
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,461
because he loved you.

862
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,929
And the minute he could,

863
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,898
he fucking had your dumb ass
out there slinging.

864
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:01,066
And look where that got you.

865
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,801
Don't listen
to her lying-ass mouth, Di.

866
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:04,335
Yo, y'all fucking
making Lorenzo

867
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:06,971
to be some kind of saint,
when he set you up, too, Dru.

868
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:09,207
He wanted me to believe
that the Guaps killed Zeke,

869
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,476
and that's why he had
IG jump you.

870
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,845
All this fucking
family-first bullshit,

871
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:16,414
and this motherfucker
ain't care nothing about Zeke.

872
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:20,051
All his memorial bullshit was
only lies to cover his ass,

873
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:23,254
even though he saw how losing
Zeke was fucking killing me!

874
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:25,323
I would've did the same thing
for any of you!

875
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:27,459
Are you even listening
to yourself?

876
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:29,260
Do you hear yourself?

877
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,262
Ma, you took
our father from us.

878
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:33,098
You killed him.
Did you even think about us?

879
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:34,866
Fuck, no, you didn't,
because you only think

880
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:36,267
about your damn self as usual.

881
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:38,069
- Shut the fuck up, Diana!
- No, you shut up!

882
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,105
You need to hear this!
You need to hear this!

883
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:41,873
Let the bitch go.
Let her go, Dru.

884
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:43,908
Let her go.
Let that bitch go.

885
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,443
This whole time you made--

886
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:47,946
no, this whole time
you made me feel worthless,

887
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:51,015
saying what happened to Zeke
was my fault, but it's you.

888
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:53,451
It's you that kill everything
good in this family--

889
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:55,320
first Zeke, now Papi.

890
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,788
You know what?

891
00:45:56,788 --> 00:45:58,990
If anybody should be dead,
it's your ass, not them.

892
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,959
- I should be dead?
- Yes.

893
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,293
Get the fuck off her.

894
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:04,529
Don't you ever put your
fucking hands on me again.

895
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,131
Get the fuck out of my house!

896
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:07,966
I don't need
y'all motherfuckers.

897
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:15,807
It's all there.

898
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,175
I've had eyes on him all day.

899
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:18,977
Your boy Brayden
went into that building

900
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:20,512
a few minutes ago.

901
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:21,813
All right, bet.

902
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:23,481
Thanks, Pinky.

903
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:26,317
Sure.
You boys play nice now.

904
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:42,167
Keke fell for you.

905
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,002
Guess I underestimated
your charm.

906
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:45,803
Leave Keke out of this.

907
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,472
Look, I can help you.

908
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:50,208
Just sign this letter taking
legal liability of the Ponzi,

909
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:52,110
and then we get you
out of the country.

910
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,279
Spare me the "knight
in shining armor" bullshit.

911
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:55,513
You're no better than I am.

912
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:56,915
In fact, you might be worse.

913
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:58,283
This isn't about me.

914
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:01,019
You have
the fucking resources, Lucas.

915
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,354
Just sign the letter
clearing the rest of the family

916
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,857
and then set yourself up
in a non-extradition country,

917
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:07,525
where you'll be protected
from the Feds

918
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:09,861
and anyone else
who come after you?

919
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:11,963
What if I get bored?

920
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:13,565
Are you fucking kidding me?

921
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,869
Why would I give
all this up

922
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:20,104
to go live
in some Third World shithole?

923
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:21,372
Because despite everything,

924
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:23,374
my dad still thinks
you're worth protecting.

925
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:26,211
Your dad.
Oh, what a nice guy.

926
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:28,880
I think that's
why I dislike him so much.

927
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,050
Look, I stole a few mil
from some pigs

928
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,519
fattening their already-fat
wallets--big fucking deal.

929
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,187
Some would call that justice.

930
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,623
Uncle Lucas, can you please
just listen to me?

931
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,059
I-I am listening to you.

932
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:43,561
I am not scared
of your ghetto-ass friends.

933
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:45,930
When are you gonna
fucking get it, Brayden?

934
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,032
I hold all the cards.

935
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,601
White collar is a nuisance.

936
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:52,437
Drug dealing, that's
a whole different story, B.

937
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:54,906
Okay, but even
if you turn Tariq and I in,

938
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:56,274
the Feds are still gonna
fucking come after you.

939
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:57,875
What's the point?

940
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,245
Not if I pin the Ponzi
on Robert and Keke.

941
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:03,248
They go down
with you and Tariq.

942
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:05,583
See, that's the difference
between me and you.

943
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,252
I'm never gonna take the blame

944
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:09,954
for something I can easily pin
on someone else.

945
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:16,261
Oh, my God!

946
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:29,107
Number 40.

947
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:45,323
Are you fucking crazy?

948
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:47,225
You can get in serious trouble
for this shit.

949
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:48,626
Relax, okay?

950
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:51,162
These motherfuckers
don't record audio.

951
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:52,964
We good.

952
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:54,465
Plus, Davis said
we can chop it up.

953
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:57,468
If you start acting funny,
you gonna blow my cover.

954
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:59,570
What's up, baby? I thought
you'd be excited to see me.

955
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,473
Why? Because we fucked once?

956
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:04,475
Wow. Don't do that, all right?

957
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:07,145
'Cause I remember
it being a whole lot of times.

958
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:08,646
It doesn't matter.

959
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,214
Why are you here?

960
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:13,318
Listen,
they won't go easy on you

961
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:15,019
if Lauren points you out
in a lineup.

962
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:17,121
You think
I don't know that already?

963
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,990
So flip on Tariq.

964
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,658
Put the blame on him, Effie,
'cause they don't want you.

965
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:22,293
They want him.

966
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,662
Now, I've already figured out
exactly what you can tell 'em,

967
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:26,998
so he takes all the weight.

968
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:28,966
I ain't even built like that.

969
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:34,172
So you gonna go to prison?

970
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:36,341
You risk us all going away
for this nigga Tariq,

971
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:38,343
and I'm the one right here--I'm
the one that's got your back?

972
00:49:38,343 --> 00:49:40,611
I didn't ask you
to have my back.

973
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:43,381
It ain't about you.
It ain't about Tariq.

974
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:45,983
It's about me making
a choice for myself.

975
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,019
What the fuck, Effie?

976
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:50,221
This ain't the time
to play hard, okay?

977
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:52,657
Now, this can work out for both
of us if you just listen.

978
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:56,527
There's no us, Cane, and
I'm not playing anything.

979
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,029
Get the fuck out of here.

980
00:49:58,029 --> 00:50:00,264
My real lawyer will be here
in a minute.

981
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:09,707
Fuck you.

982
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:28,493
Fucking finally.

983
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:31,529
What the fuck you gonna do?
Pop me in the wide open, 2-BIT?

984
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,131
I should...

985
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:35,566
since you still owe me, nigga.

986
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:38,736
But as my man
Warren Buffet says,

987
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:41,739
sell when a competitive
advantage changes.

988
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:44,575
I got a letter
from that white lawyer.

989
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:47,078
- From Saxe?
- Yep.

990
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:49,247
He knew I had beef
with your pop,

991
00:50:49,247 --> 00:50:51,749
so he sent me
some valuable information.

992
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:54,385
I'm thinking 100 bands

993
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,654
on top of what
you already owed on your tab.

994
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:58,289
What the fuck?

995
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,425
Listen, I ran through a lot of
my liquid already, all right?

996
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:01,626
I could give you some weapons

997
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:03,694
and some--some--some product
on top of that.

998
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:06,097
But I don't know. There's
not much I can do right now.

999
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:08,232
The plug got us diversifying
the fucking portfolio.

1000
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,771
And I want the keys
to your ride.

1001
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:15,440
Nigga, what?

1002
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,342
You can take mine.

1003
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:20,378
That's gotta be worth knowing
where Tasha's holed up.

1004
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:24,615
It's a offer
you can't refuse...

1005
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:28,252
unless you want somebody
to shoot your moms.

1006
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,455
What the fuck are you talking--

1007
00:51:30,455 --> 00:51:31,789
Here.

1008
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:56,514
Hello.

1009
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:58,349
Tameika, somebody
knows Tasha's location.

1010
00:51:58,349 --> 00:51:59,884
Tariq, that's impossible.

1011
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,719
Your mother's whereabouts
are sealed.

1012
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:04,121
Look, even if it wasn't true,
sending some extra protection

1013
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,423
over there wouldn't hurt, right?

1014
00:52:05,423 --> 00:52:06,691
If it gives you peace of mind,

1015
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:08,526
I'll call the Marshals' office
in the morning.

1016
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:10,394
Tameika, I need it
to happen now.

1017
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:11,429
Please.

1018
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:12,830
Okay. Okay.

1019
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,465
I'll put the call in now.

1020
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,834
All right, thank you.

1021
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:32,183
Where is that child?

1022
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:33,451
You know it's not safe

1023
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:35,353
for you to be letting her
run around like you do.

1024
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:36,687
Yes, I know, Mama.

1025
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:37,722
I just want her to have

1026
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:39,357
as normal of a childhood
as possible.

1027
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:40,625
Oh, girl, please.

1028
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:43,694
That ship has sailed,
young lady.

1029
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:51,369
You know,
I don't always like to hear

1030
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:54,305
your criticism.

1031
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:01,712
'Riq.

1032
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:03,381
It's you.

1033
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:04,916
- I missed you so much.
- Shh.

1034
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:06,951
Just wait till Big Mama
and Mama see you.

1035
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:10,755
Shit.

1036
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:13,724
All right, just stay down
and be quiet, all right?

1037
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:22,934
Just turn around.

1038
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:38,249
Hey, ya, fellas.

1039
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:48,759
Shit.

1040
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:54,899
Well, Mama, if you are
so worried about it,

1041
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,268
please go ahead
and get Yasmine, then.

1042
00:53:57,268 --> 00:53:59,937
Yes, I will do just that,
because it seems like

1043
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:02,773
I'm the only one around here
who gives a damn.

1044
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:04,942
Really?

1045
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:06,477
Okay, Mama.

1046
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:11,983
Tommy?

1047
00:54:11,983 --> 00:54:13,684
Hey, Tasha.

1048
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,620
Yas, wait right here.

1049
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,022
Tommy, what the fuck
are you gonna do--

1050
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,558
shoot me with Yas
and Big Mama right outside?

1051
00:54:20,558 --> 00:54:23,694
Don't worry. I got a silencer.
They ain't gonna hear nothing.

1052
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:29,266
Look, I-I don't--I-I mean,
how did you even find me?

1053
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,802
Your buddy Monet Tejada--

1054
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:33,571
she dropped me a message.

1055
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:35,473
Maybe she trying to get
on my good side,

1056
00:54:35,473 --> 00:54:38,809
or maybe
she finally figured out

1057
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:42,346
that your son is
the fucking seed of the Devil.

1058
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:43,981
Please, don't do this, Tommy.

1059
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:45,650
- Too late, Tasha.
- You don't wanna do this.

1060
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,051
Don't do this.
Tommy, please.

1061
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,986
- Tommy!
- 'Riq?

1062
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:50,354
Tariq, what the fuck
is you doing?

1063
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:51,722
Okay, look, stop.

1064
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:53,924
This battle between us
has gotta end.

1065
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:56,394
Put the guns down.
Tommy, look at me.

1066
00:54:56,394 --> 00:54:59,330
We're the only family
we got left.

1067
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,932
Fuck out of here
with that family bullshit.

1068
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:04,001
Family don't snitch
on each other.

1069
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:06,337
They don't kill each other.
They don't turn on each other.

1070
00:55:06,337 --> 00:55:09,507
None of us wanted that shit,
all right, Uncle Tommy?

1071
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:11,942
Now, I love you,
but I'll put a bullet in you

1072
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:13,878
to stop you
from killing my mother.

1073
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:16,347
You think you finally
gonna kill me, huh?

1074
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:19,517
Well, you killed your father,

1075
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:21,952
so pulling the trigger on me
ain't gonna be nothing to you.

1076
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:23,087
No.

1077
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:36,033
Shit.

1078
00:55:39,704 --> 00:55:41,539
Tameika.

1079
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:42,940
Easy, Tariq.

1080
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,042
You have a head injury.

1081
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:47,344
Looks like someone hit you
on the back of the head.

1082
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,880
Estelle called the Marshals.

1083
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,882
They found their people dead

1084
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:54,752
and you lying
on the floor unconscious.

1085
00:55:54,752 --> 00:55:57,888
Estelle said a man broke in.

1086
00:55:57,888 --> 00:56:00,024
She heard him
threatening Tasha.

1087
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:01,358
Did you know the man?

1088
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,393
What?

1089
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,397
Tameika, where's my mom?

1090
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:08,432
What happened
to my mother, Tameika?

1091
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:12,002
I'm sorry, Tariq,
but Tasha is missing.

1092
00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:14,939
But your sister
and grandmother are safe.

1093
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:18,409
The authorities are searching,

1094
00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:20,911
but they don't have any leads
to her whereabouts.

1095
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:24,915
It's possible whoever
was threatening her took her.

1096
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:27,585
I'm so sorry, Tariq.
