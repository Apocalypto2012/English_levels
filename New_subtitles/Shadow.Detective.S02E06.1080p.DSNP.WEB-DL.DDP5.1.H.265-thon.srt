1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,830
2 YEARS AGO

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,620
<i><font color="#80FFFF">To the ten direction's Buddhas</i></font>

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,590
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The profound and stainless Dharma</i></font>

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:13,550
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And the liberated Sangha,
we sincerely go for refuge</i></font>

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,390
<i><font color="#80FFFF">With great love and kindness...</i></font>

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,890
There are always good temples
in famous mountains.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,810
Now that you've prayed to Buddha,
it should work out this time, sir.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,900
It should.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,070
It's right there.

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,450
The perfect location
to start the port city project.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,120
Kook Jinhan, is it?

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,750
Can we really trust him?

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,710
He's the kind of man

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,550
who'd do anything to complete a mission.

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,550
That's why Chairman Jang recruited him.

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,260
Like you said, this must not fail.

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,680
We'll take care of those who control Geumo

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,020
before this year ends.

19
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,810
Hundreds of billions of won
will be at stake.

20
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,650
We have to get rid
of those maggots in advance.

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,730
Also, Assemblyman Lee.

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,450
As I told you last time,
once this is taken care of...

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,700
All right.

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,370
You'll be nominated for the by-elections

25
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,670
the year after I become governor.

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,630
All right.

27
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,360
SHADOW DETECTIVE SEASON 2

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,870
Team Leader Yeon.

29
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,170
Are you all right?

30
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,790
Hold on.

31
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,250
Wake up.

32
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,030
This is your last chance.

33
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,120
You walk out that door, and you die.

34
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,460
What choice are you going to make?

35
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,430
Stop.

36
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,050
Mind your manners.

37
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,340
Nothing good comes out
of being rambunctious.

38
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,230
Don't you agree, Assemblyman Lee?

39
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,310
I heard you even sent people to find me,
so I came rushing to see you.

40
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,070
Did you call the cops on Hwanju?

41
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,900
Let's talk inside.

42
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,920
Team Leader Yeon.

43
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,550
LEE SEONGA

44
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,850
Call an ambulance over
to the safe house. Right now.

45
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,270
Team Leader Yeon.

46
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,190
Team Leader Yeon!

47
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,950
Team Leader Yeon!

48
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,990
Team Leader Yeon.

49
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,540
Yeon Juhyun, wake up.

50
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeon Juhyun!

51
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,080
And Secretary Cha?

52
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,170
Did you kill him?

53
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,250
Of course not.

54
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,170
You don't put down a dog
when you still have use for it.

55
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,800
You were the one who taught me that.

56
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,430
AUGUST, 2005
JOINT INVESTIGATION HEADQUARTERS

57
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,230
Juhwan.

58
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,000
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It's illegal to detain and torture
an incumbent police officer</i></font>

59
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,620
to extract a confession.

60
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,170
Illegal...

61
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,760
These were all found
at his father's house.

62
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,730
Hey, Choi Dohyung!

63
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,530
You're the ones who did something illegal.

64
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,400
I told you to wipe the drug gang out.

65
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,320
Instead, you stole the drugs
and sold them!

66
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,830
All right. Detective Choi Dohyung.

67
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,290
From now on, you'd better choose
your words carefully.

68
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,790
Or else I'll rip the uniforms
off your men's backs.

69
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,680
You vile police scum.

70
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,020
"You vile police scum."

71
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,060
You've been holding that
against me all this time?

72
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,690
All right.

73
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,910
What is it that you want?

74
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,750
I want to see how far we vile police scum
can go when you give them power.

75
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,590
Is that nonsense how you cajoled
Chief Baek into taking your side?

76
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,340
Chief Baek is also a cop
who was just exploited by you.

77
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,680
All I did was do what you taught me.

78
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,600
I'll take responsibility for everything.

79
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,520
There's no need for my men
to get involved.

80
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,730
Please.

81
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,690
Why? Trying to play the hero?

82
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,360
What did you say their name was?

83
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,030
He called it the Geumjeong Society.

84
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,030
Right, the Geumjeong Society.

85
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,080
An organization founded by a bunch
of maggots trying to band together.

86
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,220
I'll spare you.

87
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,430
That little playtime of yours.

88
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,930
How about I make it come true?

89
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,420
What the...

90
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,710
-Why are the lights...
-Hey!

91
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Let go of me!

92
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,620
Given the number of offenses
and quantity of narcotics

93
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,790
found in the possession of the defendant,

94
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,330
the court finds it necessary

95
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,840
to enact a commensurate punishment.

96
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,590
The court will now read the verdict.

97
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,090
The defendant is hereby
sentenced to three years in prison.

98
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,800
No. I didn't do it, Your Honor.

99
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,390
Drugs? I didn't do it, Your Honor!

100
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,990
Now that the union leader's
out of the way,

101
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,910
your brother's construction
shouldn't be disrupted for the time being.

102
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,240
It's good to see the prosecution
and police cooperating.

103
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,200
Thank you.

104
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,380
Sir.

105
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,170
About the national convention
next month...

106
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,010
Hey. Don't rush things.

107
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,340
I'm aware.

108
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,050
I've prepared everything
for your political debut, Prosecutor Lee.

109
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,350
Thank you.

110
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,440
As for the police personnel,
all you have to do is what's written here.

111
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,370
Just the chief investigator of narcotics?

112
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,000
I thought you were trying
to get rid of the commissioner.

113
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,460
I'm thinking of swapping the arms
and legs first, so they don't notice.

114
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,800
Okay. I see. Good.

115
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,900
- I'll see you soon.
-Yes, sir.

116
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,160
Had it not been for me,
the two of you wouldn't be anything.

117
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,040
On the contrary.

118
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,620
All that you enjoy now
was possible thanks to us.

119
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,460
All right.

120
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:05,210
I admit you were quite useful for a mutt.

121
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,800
But that doesn't mean
you can bite the hand that feeds you.

122
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,180
So...

123
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,100
Now, what?

124
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,900
Are you going to destroy me?

125
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,070
Would that even be possible?

126
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,160
Above me are the ones I paid off,

127
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,620
and below me are the ones who paid me off.

128
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,580
If I'm finished,

129
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,460
you'll be nothing but dust.

130
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,670
I know this.

131
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,510
Half the people who rule this country
are connected to you.

132
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,260
You know that

133
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,770
and yet, you still do this?

134
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,270
Only because I don't have what they do.

135
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,560
What?

136
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,480
Fear.

137
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,030
I do not fear either dying or living.

138
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,410
But those involved with you probably are.

139
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,580
Because they have so much to lose.

140
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,460
When the sun comes up,

141
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,460
all you will be is a criminal
who traded drugs and incited murder.

142
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,180
There will be no one left to cover you.

143
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,730
Yong Hwanju was arrested.

144
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,100
Also, I looked into it.

145
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,060
Chief Baek personally asked
for cooperation from Narcotics.

146
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,440
In that case, Chief Seo Gwangsu
should be getting investigated soon.

147
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,610
We've been able to locate the car
that took Team Leader Han through CCTV.

148
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,070
We're tracking it now.

149
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,120
We'll let you know if anything comes up.

150
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,340
We finally meet.

151
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,680
Although not under pleasant circumstances.

152
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,350
Thanks to your decisive action,
Team Leader Yeon will live.

153
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,640
Thank you.

154
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,690
Team Leader Yeon's father, Yeon Sanghoon.

155
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,770
Does he have anything to do
with the Geumjeong Society?

156
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,410
Yeon Sanghoon died chasing after them.

157
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,530
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It was when we were finally</i></font>

158
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,540
<i><font color="#80FFFF">about to see progress
in the investigation.</i></font>

159
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,250
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It was written off as a simple
hit-and-run, but I'm positive.</i></font>

160
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,750
<i><font color="#80FFFF">That the organization Yeon Sanghoon
and I were chasing was behind it.</i></font>

161
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,920
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But back then,</i></font>

162
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,590
<i><font color="#80FFFF">there was nothing I could do.</i></font>

163
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,970
<i><font color="#80FFFF">After a long time, I became the director
of the Inspection Department,</i></font>

164
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,300
<i><font color="#80FFFF">so I decided to go after them again.</i></font>

165
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,520
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I told Team Leader Yeon Juhyun
the truth, too.</i></font>

166
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,770
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The only thing that was
in Yeon Sanghoon's last report</i></font>

167
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,310
<i><font color="#80FFFF">was that picture.</i></font>

168
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,940
I failed once again.

169
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,570
I wanted to make sure
Sanghoon's death wasn't in vain...

170
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,870
By using his daughter?

171
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,750
I doubt that was what
Yeon Sanghoon would have wanted.

172
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,130
If you really cared about him,

173
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,880
you should have taken
on this responsibility yourself.

174
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,470
Instead of getting his daughter involved.

175
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,330
Detective Han's car passed by this?

176
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,580
Yes, an hour ago.

177
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,920
But it wasn't caught
on the security camera up ahead.

178
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,380
Yeah?

179
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,640
Let's go that way. Over there.

180
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,970
Okay.

181
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,570
NOEUL GOSIWON

182
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,090
What happened to your face?

183
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,260
It's nothing.

184
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,800
What brings you here at this hour?

185
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,850
I'm in need of your consolation.

186
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,060
It was a really long day.

187
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,730
You'll be cleared of the charges soon.
Don't worry.

188
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,610
This is the first of many.

189
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,530
It'll happen a lot more often from now on.

190
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,410
So why did you choose to walk
this exhausting path?

191
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,740
I can say the same to you.

192
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,250
I heard from a colleague in Narcotics

193
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,920
that he saw you.

194
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,050
What a small world.

195
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,930
You told me last time.

196
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,430
That you had some unfinished business
to take care of.

197
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,640
Was what happened today related to that?

198
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,290
Wait. Stop the car.

199
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,960
- What?
- Stop the car.

200
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,140
That's it, isn't it?

201
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,430
Yes, it is.

202
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Get him out.

203
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,090
Don't you need my help?

204
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,430
You remember that thing
you used to say all the time?

205
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,390
That in order to protect ourselves,
we should help each other.

206
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,190
I did?

207
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,110
Taekrok.

208
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,490
Let's stop here.

209
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,490
It's all in the past.

210
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,660
Are you really willing to go further?

211
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,500
Is that more important than your own life?

212
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,260
What's with you today?

213
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,470
I just hate that you're this kind of cop.

214
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:51,970
Someone who dies
just because of that sense of duty.

215
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,480
You bastard!

216
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,900
I don't want to see that.

217
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,650
If you're talking about Jinseok, stop.

218
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,570
Neither one of us
has anything to be proud of.

219
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,950
I don't regret it.
If you can avoid it, you should.

220
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,030
I said stop.

221
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,040
Whatever you're doing now,

222
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,960
don't regret it later.

223
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,170
That would be...

224
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,040
useless.

225
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,980
It doesn't matter how small.
Find anything you can!

226
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
Yes?

227
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,280
We found a note in his pocket.

228
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,040
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It admits to killing Woo Jangik
on Lee Youngho's orders.</i></font>

229
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,840
Any other belongings?

230
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,010
He only had his phone on him

231
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,600
but there was nothing unusual
in this call history or texts.

232
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,890
I'll get back
as soon as things get sorted.

233
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,850
All right.

234
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,450
Yeon Juhyun. Wake up. Yeon Juhyun!

235
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:15,200
JULY 11, 2005
GEUMJEONG?

236
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,660
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Chief Baek turned
his back on Lee Youngho.</i></font>

237

240
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,390
JULY 11, 2005
GEUMJEONG?

241
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,870
Your nephew, Yong Hwanju,
has been found to have used money

242
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,290
from drugs for your campaign expenses.

243
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,370
Do you have anything to say?

244
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,790
Is it true that a police officer

245
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,540
from Geumo Station committed suicide,
accusing you of inciting murder?

246
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,510
Were the charges against
Choi Dohyung politically motivated?

247
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,340
Is it true that you ordered
the search and seizure?

248
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,180
- Please say a word, sir.
-Is it all true?

249
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,020
Your youngest daughter studying
in the US is preparing for a recital.

250
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,440
You son of a bitch!

251
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,230
I'm going to kill you...

252
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,870
Do not forget.

253
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,420
We're always watching you

254
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,840
whenever and wherever you are.

255
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,180
Prosecutor Lee Youngho.

256
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,980
From now on, you'd better choose
your words carefully.

257
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,240
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Has a candidate ever been put</i></font>

<i><font color="#80FFFF">However, his arrest will likely have

265
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,690
Prosecutor Ahn, this is your chance.

266
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,150
You can't let this get away
if you're thinking of getting ahead.

267
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,730
Yes, sir.

268
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,030
There's the issue of his nephew's drugs,

269
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,240
but the core of this
is him inciting murder.

270
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,160
Make sure to focus on that.

271
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,280
Yes, sir.

272
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,410
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Chief Prosecutor Won.</i></font>

273
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,420
Lee Youngho is only going to keep
using you for trivial things such as this.

274
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,170
When I become a member
of the National Assembly

275
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,920
and achieve what I want,

276
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,090
you'll be with me,
sitting somewhere higher.

277
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,260
FOR A HAPPY YOUNGSEO
CANDIDATE 2 KIM JINSUN

278
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,600
Candidate Kim is entering.

279
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,610
- Congratulations.
- Oh, not you too.

280
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,070
Let's wait until the results
come out tomorrow.

281
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,570
I think you're being too modest.

282
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,370
I recall being shocked
when the prosecution put you

283
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,660
under a search and seizure,

284
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,580
but now I can't believe
what's happening at all.

285
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,120
What a turn of fortune.

286
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,750
Things are finally as they should be.

287
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,340
The timing of it was so perfect

288
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,630
that I thought it was perhaps
divine intervention.

289
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,100
I heard that the party leader
called to congratulate you.

290
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,640
Yes. And they'll invite you
to a formal greeting after the election.

291
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,100
How nice.

292
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,730
The party has great expectations for you,
Director Choi.

293
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,320
They're saying you were of great help

294
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,780
in gaining the support
of the people at the last leg.

295
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,910
I'll have to live up
to those expectations then.

296
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,000
Why did Chief Baek
send Narcotics there?

297
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,290
Did he really betray Lee Youngho?

298
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,590
Team Leader Han was murdered.

299
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,510
What?

300
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,510
Yong Hwanju will soon testify about you.

301
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,390
You have to get away.

302
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,190
I guess I won't be seeing you
for a while again.

303
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,950
I should take one down with me.

304
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,960
What are you going to do?

305
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,870
I think I should do that much

306
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,710
and give them a good blow.

307
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,550
Then I'll be able to face
the guys who died before us.

308
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,250
Among those who retired
from the Special Operation Unit in 2005,

309
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,830
I picked out the ones
whose jobs and addresses were unknown.

310
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,550
PROFILE

311
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,720
PROFILE
NAME: KWON JUHWAN

312
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,680
"Kwon Juhwan."

313
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,520
There's this man whom Chief Baek
refers to as Director Kwon.

314
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,680
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He seems to be their enforcer.</i></font>

315
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,640
Director Kwon?

316
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,020
Is this him?

317
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,270
NAME: KWON JUHWAN

318
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:43,210
He was a former UDT, then joined
the police through special recruitment

319
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,840
- but was fired after five years.
- The reason?

320
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,050
Violating the Narcotics Control Act.

321
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,720
This ex-spec ops...
Maybe he carried drugs on him?

322
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,600
It's possible if he got his hands
on evidence or foreclosures.

323
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,100
When did he get out?

324
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,560
He was sentenced to three years

325
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,810
but was pardoned as a model prisoner
the year after that.

326
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,150
Find out who the prosecutor
was at the time.

327
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,860
One moment.

328
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,230
- Wait.
- What?

329
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,700
What you just said. It was mentioned
in an article I found last night.

330
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,030
That was around 2005 too.

331
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,950
Drugs, drugs, police...

332
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,580
Drugs, police...

333
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,500
Here it is. Here.

334
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,420
An article from November 21, 2005.

335
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,750
"A final trial was held
for an incumbent police officer

336
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,670
who was arrested last July
on charges of stealing confiscated goods

337
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,430
from the scene of a drug bust
and distributing them to the market.

338
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,010
An official from the joint investigation
team of the prosecution and police

339
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,560
who investigated this case
expressed concern about

340
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,310
the deviant behavior of the officer
in question being misinterpreted

341
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,060
as corruption of the entire police force."

342
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,490
- November 2005?
- Yes.

343
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,990
I found the prosecutor.

344
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,750
Is it Lee Youngho?

345
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,500
PROSECUTOR LEE YOUNGHO

346
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,500
- Yes.
- What's the date?

347
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,210
September 5, 2005.

348
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,260
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Lee Youngho caught
Director Kwon stealing drugs.</i></font>

349
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,930
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And now Director Kwon
takes orders from Chief Baek.</i></font>

350
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Hello?</i></font>

351
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,490
Hey, it's me.

352
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,320
I'm sending you information
on this guy called Kwon Juhwan.

353
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,950
Look into it thoroughly.

354
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,570
And check if he has any connections

355
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,330
to a member of the opposition party
or Assemblywoman Kim Jinsun.

356
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,460
Hey, send Seonga all the materials
on Kwon Juhwan.

357
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,540
Okay.

358
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,050
Are you going somewhere?

359
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,010
There's someone I have to meet.

360
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,660
So you're Kim Taekrok.

361
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:26,040
You've got guts coming all the way here
as a mere detective.

362
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,210
You got any cigarettes?

363
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:54,030
I thought you'd be a bit more formidable.

364
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,650
What?

365
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:02,160
You're just another pitiful man,
after all.

366
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,370
What? Did you think
I'd be a monster with horns?

367
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,000
That would have been better.

368
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,540
I wouldn't have felt this underwhelmed.

369
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,510
Sure, talk all you want.

370
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,140
This could be your last chance
to be on that high horse of yours.

371
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,430
How much longer do you think
I'll be staying here?

372
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,810
You were betrayed by the ones
you've raised. What can you do now?

373
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,060
What?

374
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,150
Chief Baek. Director Kwon.

375
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,230
You thought you owned them,
but you didn't.

376
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,740
You were just taken advantage of,
then abandoned at the tipping point.

377
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,200
Like Kook Jinhan.

378
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,000
Who is it?

379
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,670
The real boss.

380
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,300
- What difference will it make if you know?
- You have no other option now.

381
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,430
Are you counting
on your drug junkie nephew?

382
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,730
So you were the one behind Seo Gwangsu.

383
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,070
Do you know what happened
because you did that?

384
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,910
Someone else benefited from it.

385
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,540
Both our hard work has gone to the dog.

386
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:33,880
Congratulations on Director
Choi Dohyung's new beginning.

387
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,880
Congratulations.

388
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,760
You're going to be really busy now.

389
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,510
Let me know whenever you need my help.

390
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,560
You're already helping me a lot.

391
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,690
You wrapped up the search and seizure too.

392
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,900
I almost made a huge mistake back then.

393
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,280
The past is just the past.
What's important is the future.

394
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,530
I have the Chief Prosecutor
to rely on at the prosecutor's office.

395
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,790
Chief Baek is keeping me safe
with the police.

396
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,500
And there's no strategist in politics
as good as Secretary Cha.

397
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,000
I am quite fortunate.

398
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,920
I appreciate the compliment.

399
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,130
We're the ones who are honored.

400
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,010
I'm just coming back
from meeting with Lee Youngho.

401
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,810
The Inspection Department Chief said
it was the last thing he could do for me.

402
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,770
I've been ordered to return too.

403
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,610
Back to Juvenile Affairs at the Agency.

404
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,360
There's no time.

405
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,620
That Director Kwon you found.

406
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,870
I'm sure it's the man
from the picture my father left.

407
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,500
All we have to do is catch him.

408
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,330
If we catch him...

409
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,580
Team Leader Yeon.

410
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,130
The Inspection Department
took advantage of you.

411
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,010
And you almost died for it.

412
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,060
It doesn't matter.

413
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,060
Even if I'm taken advantage of.

414
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,230
If it means avenging my father...

415
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,170
Focus on recovering for now.

416
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,130
I'm on the move.

417
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,060
My father left...

418
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,730
one last report.

419
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,760
You came to turn yourself in?

420
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,680
I bribed Candidate Lee Youngho.

421
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,140
I really was given probation.

422
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,520
I don't know how many higher-ups
he had to talk to in the middle.

423
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,690
Then after that,

424
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:48,990
you contacted Yong Hwanju,
Cha Kyungpil, and Son Sangwook?

425
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,280
There is one more person.

426
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,590
All right. I'll see you next time.

427
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,340
Yes, sir. Take care.

428
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,880
Right.

429
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,410
- Let's go.
- Yes, take care.

430
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,300
I thought I told you to only bring
Han Giyong out of there.

431
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,840
I'm sorry, sir.

432
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,800
Why did you try to kill Yeon Juhyun?

433
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,720
Didn't Chief Baek report to you?

434
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,770
Do you remember Yeon Sanghoon?

435
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,450
Yeon Sanghoon.

436
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,740
So he's the one causing us trouble?

437
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,290
Yes, sir.

438
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,420
You take this on.

439
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,170
That way you'll earn
Team Leader Choi's trust.

440
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,050
Yes, sir.

441
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,010
Yeon Juhyun is Yeon Sanghoon's daughter.

442
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,680
That's why Chief Baek ordered me
to get rid of Yeon Juhyun.

443
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,020
GEUMO POLICE STATION

Are you really willing to go further?

462
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,020
Is that more important than your own life?

463
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,610
If you're talking about Jinseok, stop.

464
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,730
Neither one of us
has anything to be proud of.

Taekrok.

474
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:03,180
Long time no see.

475
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,150
I'm all right, Taekrok.

476
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,490
See?

477
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,820
I can even go hiking on the hill out back.

478
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,990
Yeah. I heard you were doing okay.

479
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:31,160
Then you should have come sooner
to have a drink with me.

480
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,040
We have some good pork.

481
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,090
It was delicious.

482
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,390
Yes.

483
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,270
I would like to keep the party's
welcome ceremony a simple affair.

484
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,520
I'll see you then.

So...

487
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,260
you already knew
Kwon Juhwan from the start?

488
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,510
Yes, Dohyung hooked me up with him.

489
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:31,810
Thanks to him,
I was able to get back on my feet so soon.

490
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,140
This restaurant too.

491
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,190
How do Dohyung and Kwon Juhwan
know each other?

492
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,650
They were both members of BST.

493
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,440
Don't tell me you don't remember.

494
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:45,860
You started it. "Be Safe Today too." BST.

495
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,950
Kwon Juhwan...

496
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,490
was a member of BST?

497
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,620
Yes.

498
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,040
I think it was
after you returned to Geumo.

499
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,120
Dohyung brought him in as a new member.

500
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:02,050
I thought BST ended after I left.

501
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,510
Dohyung kept it going for a bit.

502
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,930
And then,
I heard it just kind of fizzled out.

503
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,220
- Hey, do you know if...
- Right.

504
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,770
I think he changed the name
from BST to something else.
