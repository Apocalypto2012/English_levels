1
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,200
Tie them up.

2
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:03,701
The hands are not the issue.

3
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:06,402
The fight is the issue.

4
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:08,703
The battle is the issue.

5
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:13,204
Who imposes the terms of the battle,
will impose the terms of the peace.

6
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:16,005
You think he has a handicap?
- No.

7
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:20,106
The other guy has a handicap,
if he cannot control himself.

8
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:23,607
You control yourself,
you control him.

9
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,008
Take him to court.

10
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:33,809
A man distracted is a man defeated.

11
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,510
That's right.
You've heard that before, huh?

12
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:40,011
Try it again.

13
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:46,012
Take him to court.
- Taking him to court.

14
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:49,513
Good, got him down.
The fight is over.

15
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:51,614
That's it.
The fight is over.

16
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:54,615
Finish it here.
It is over.

17
00:02:57,116 --> 00:03:01,116
Ok, improve the position.
Improve the position.

18
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:03,817
Keep the weight on his head.

19
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:05,918
What next?

20
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,719
Watch the slam.
Keep your head up.

21
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,120
Nice. Nice.
You felt that, huh?

22
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:15,721
Good.
Keep it back.

23
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:18,122
Observe.

24
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:21,023
Ok, improve.

25
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:24,424
<i>Breath, breath.</i>

26
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:30,825
<i>Good. Good.
You felt that. Good.</i>

27
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:35,026
<i>Ok.</i>

28
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:39,427
Improve the position.
Improve the position. Good.

29
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:42,128
Where?
Take him to Brazil.

30
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,929
Good. Good.

31
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,330
Arm grip. See that.
Excellent.

32
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:55,431
Triangle. Hold.
Insist. Insist on him.

33
00:03:55,432 --> 00:03:57,632
Insist on the move.

34
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:01,733
Good.
Now, what?

35
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:05,934
Breath. Breath. Breath.

36
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:09,135
Good.
Good hit.

37
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:13,236
Ok.
Breath. Breath.

38
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:16,137
Breath. You know the escape.
You know the escape.

39
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:18,738
Breath. Breath.

40
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,239
There's always an escape.

41
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,740
You know the escape.
You know the escape.

42
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:27,041
Breath.
There's always an escape.

43
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:29,342
I'm passing out.

44
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:31,343
All right.

45
00:04:34,244 --> 00:04:36,444
Great class.

46
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:39,545
Great class.

47
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,246
C'mon buddy.
- Great.

48
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,547
Hey, stick around.

49
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:50,548
You don't fight your way clear?

50
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:52,949
I was passing out.

51
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,750
There is no situation,
you cannot escape from.

52
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,951
You know the escape.

53
00:04:58,152 --> 00:05:00,252
You know the escape,
show it to me.

54
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:01,753
Show it to me.

55
00:05:01,754 --> 00:05:03,454
Show me the escape.

56
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:06,555
Good, good.
You know the escape.

57
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,456
You just got tired.
What's the lesson?

58
00:05:08,457 --> 00:05:11,457
Don't get tired.
- Let the other guy get tired.

59
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:15,058
You want to fight like a black belt, huh?

60
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:18,059
You want to test for the black belt?

61
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,460
Snowflake, give him his wish.

62
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:24,661
Alright, raise your hands.
Your hands, get them right up.

63
00:05:24,662 --> 00:05:26,662
Concentrate on the fight.

64
00:05:26,663 --> 00:05:28,963
Concentrate on the fight.

65
00:05:28,964 --> 00:05:32,664
Insist.
Insist.

66
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:37,665
Did you tell me
this training saved your life?

67
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,066
This is how you would pay me?

68
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,767
Breath through it,
the moves work.

69
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:45,068
Defend the neck.

70
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:49,269
Take the fight out of your face.

71
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,270
Well, that's it.
Officer down.

72
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:54,971
That makes you mad.

73
00:05:55,072 --> 00:05:59,672
Control your emotions.
Control your emotions!

74
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:03,073
Breath.
Breath.

75
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:05,074
Breath.

76
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:10,675
Alright. Ok, that's it.
That's it.

77
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:16,576
Good.

78
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:20,077
Hit the showers and
come back in. Good.

79
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:25,078
Good.

80
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,979
You're ok?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,380
He is good, huh?
- Yeah, he is good.

82
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:40,981
Hi, I'm lost.

83
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:44,482
I can't find the fucking pharmacy.
What?

84
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:47,383
I don't know.

85
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:51,884
Well, you said I have to find it
before eight o'clock.

86
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:56,885
Thank you.
Ok.

87
00:07:31,186 --> 00:07:34,386
Hey, hey.
Wait.

88
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,687
Hey, stop.

89
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:47,188
Answer the phone.

90
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:49,889
Hi, yeah I missed the guy.

91
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,290
He needed your help with some
of those things.

92
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:57,491
No, a regular doctor is not going to
fill the prescription.

93
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:59,492
What?

94
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:02,593
Because he is closed.

95
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:08,594
The prescription is not going to
stand up at a straight pharmacy.

96
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:11,595
Alright, but I need...

97
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:16,496
Alright, ok.

98
00:08:27,897 --> 00:08:28,897
Hello?

99
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:32,898
Hi, this is Sondra Terry with
Southside Ju-Jitsu.

100
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,499
Yeah, I have your
invoice number 20903.

101
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,600
Yeah, you indicate that you didn't
receive our payment.

102
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:49,801
Ok, but...
On my record it shows that...

103
00:08:49,802 --> 00:08:53,302
Look, I'm trying to run a business
just like you.

104
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:57,803
I'll wait.

105
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:04,404
As all the world knows,
tomorrow is Wednesday.

106
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,805
So we will be on Wednesday schedule.

107
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:08,506
9 AM.
Beginning self defense.

108
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,607
11.15 AM.
I am watching the match.

109
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:14,408
You going to have to train if you
want that black belt, officer Joe.

110
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:15,709
Mike?

111
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,510
What you want the officer walk you home?

112
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:20,111
It's rough out there.

113
00:09:20,112 --> 00:09:22,312
Well, after he gets his black belt
he can walk me to the car.

114
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:23,513
That will make me feel secure.

115
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:25,114
How is the belt going to make you feel secure?

116
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:28,015
I know his fucking pants
are not going to fall down.

117
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:33,716
Hey, by the way.
Aren't you going to buy a new rig?

118
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:35,117
I was thinking about it.

119
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:37,018
Oh, you were thinking about it.

120
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,019
I tell you what, why don't you take
some of that good off-duty money..

121
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,220
..and buy a new shoulder-rig.
Why?

122
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:46,721
A shoulder is nothing but a handlebar.
- Ok.

123
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:48,922
Excuse me.
Eh, who is this?

124
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,523
It's all right.
Come in, come in.

125
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:51,724
Hi.
- Mike?

126
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,525
I believe I..
- Mike, can you come here please?

127
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,526
Yes, thank you.
I was driving..

128
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:58,727
Take off your coat.
How can we help you?

129
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,228
Look, I heard your car..

130
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:02,729
Hey Joe, take the lady's coat. Come on.

131
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,530
..the car, I pay you cash.
So we can just..

132
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:05,931
No, stay away from me!
- Miss?

133
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:08,332
Don't touch me!
No, don't touch me.

134
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:18,333
I am a police officer!

135
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:50,634
The wind blew something into
the window.

136
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:53,535
The wind blew something into the window?
- Yeah.

137
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:58,136
Yeah, sure.
You're all ok?

138
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:00,137
Yeah, we're fine.

139
00:11:00,138 --> 00:11:02,438
You want me to start to clean up?

140
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:05,339
Yeah, thanks Snowflake.

141
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,540
What else am I going to say,
she's trying to kill a police officer?

142
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:12,541
Are you sure?
- I am sure.

143
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,342
It's ok.

144
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:44,743
I am an attorney, I...
I can't let...

145
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:47,244
The officer thinks it didn't happen.

146
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:49,045
Eh, I'm sorry...

147
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:51,346
He thinks it didn't happen.

148
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:20,047
I thought you were going to the mountains?
- No, that's funny.

149
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:21,848
Joe?
Is Joe still inside?

150
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:23,649
No, he just left.
- Left?

151
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,050
Yeah, maybe he went to the club.

152
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:29,151
What happened to the window?
- Isn't he on at the club?

153
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:33,452
Ehm, that's funny.
- Weren't you going to the mountains?

154
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,453
Why would he go to the club?
- Isn't he working tonight?

155
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:40,454
The club? No, he hasn't worked
at the club in months.

156
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:44,855
Listen, I have to tell him something.

157
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,956
Ok, tell him.
- Why?

158
00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:50,657
Why what?
- Why hasn't he been working there?

159
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:53,758
Yeah, no.
Listen, I got to get home.

160
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:19,959
Officer Joe let the girl walk?
- Yeah, I suppose he did.

161
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,260
That was generous of him.

162
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:24,561
Yeah, I think so.

163
00:13:25,162 --> 00:13:27,562
Why did he do that?

164
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:30,463
He didn't want to bring the sauna
on the academy.

165
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:32,264
Yes, of course.

166
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:34,465
I need a black belt for him.

167
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:37,666
You didn't want to bring the sauna
on the academy.

168
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:41,367
Yes, thank you.

169
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:46,468
The car?
- Car?

170
00:13:46,469 --> 00:13:49,269
The girl drove into your car.

171
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,970
I didn't look at that.

172
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:55,371
They want cash to get the window
bought it up.

173
00:13:55,572 --> 00:13:57,672
Do you have any cash?

174
00:13:58,173 --> 00:14:02,373
And on your business,
for which you have no cash.

175
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,974
We need to replace the window.

176
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:06,975
Your cheque bounced.

177
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:09,076
My cheque?

178
00:14:09,377 --> 00:14:11,777
The martial art supply.

179
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:14,978
Mike, we're short.

180
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,279
You have no cash.

181
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,080
If we pay the window,
I can't make the rent.

182
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:25,781
Hello.

183
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:51,582
You need your ass kick out
for a loan.

184
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:55,583
Mike, you go ask him for a loan.

185
00:15:57,984 --> 00:16:00,084
Hey, Mike.

186
00:16:00,385 --> 00:16:02,485
Hey, Billy.

187
00:16:02,486 --> 00:16:04,886
Jimmy, you can't smoke in here.

188
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:08,987
We got Mike Terry down here.
- The fucking world is turning into a dungeon.

189
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:12,788
Hey, sorry. He's busy.
Five minutes.

190
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:15,489
Cardo said that?
- No, Bruno. Ricardo is out.

191
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,890
Put the cigarette out.

192
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:24,691
Hang on, I'll take a beer.
- You haven’t got no bouncer?

193
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,192
Just weekends now.
- Officer Joe?

194
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:30,593
Billy, I show you something for a drink.

195
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:32,794
I hardly think so.
Joey, the cop?

196
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:35,795
Yeah.
- Wait, come on. I'll wait for this drink.

197
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:37,696
Check out this dice.

198
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,597
So where you've been,
the cruise ships?

199
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,198
I worked on a cruise ship.

200
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,499
Why Joe quit?
- Yeah, hold on a second.

201
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,700
Check this out.

202
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,101
You ever seen that?

203
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:55,302
I am fucking fantastic, somebody
buy me this fucking drink.

204
00:16:55,303 --> 00:16:58,203
Officer Joe, why did he quit?
- What?

205
00:16:58,204 --> 00:17:00,004
Why Joe quit?

206
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:03,405
Because Bruno wasn't paying him.
They never paid him.

207
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:05,606
They never paid him?

208
00:17:11,107 --> 00:17:13,507
<i>Coming from that
Brazilian Ju-Jitsu background,</i>

209
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:17,208
<i>I spent a little time with Silva years ago
before he moved into MMA.</i>

210
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:20,609
<i>He showed me his secret technique
that his grandfather showed him.</i>

211
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:24,510
<i>I said we'll be doing that since
I was twelve in High School wrestling.</i>

212
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,111
We have a deal or we don't have a deal?

213
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:30,512
<i>He's going to have his hands full of
Morisaki, but I think it's going to be a great fight.</i>

214
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:33,013
<i>I don't know why everybody is not
coming to this fight.</i>

215
00:17:33,014 --> 00:17:35,114
<i>The main event for the IFA..</i>

216
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:36,615
We got a deal.

217
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:39,316
What good is a deal,
if nobody is making any money?

218
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:40,717
Ricardo won't do it.

219
00:17:40,718 --> 00:17:42,318
What? He's to pure?

220
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,919
What, it's not elegant?
That elegant life he lives.

221
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,220
How long is that going to last?
Answer me that.

222
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:49,521
Morisaki is going to do it?

223
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:50,622
This bullshit.

224
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:54,123
Morisaki is a whore, he's going to do
whatever the fuck I tell his people.

225
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:56,124
If he did this, he'll do anything.

226
00:17:56,125 --> 00:18:00,325
The golden ivory studded belt is
worth 250.000 dollar.

227
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:03,926
It was presented to Taketa Morisaki
by the emperor of Japan.

228
00:18:03,927 --> 00:18:05,627
Is he on the level?

229
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:08,928
The belt is a fucking national treasure,
it's worth 250.000 dollar.

230
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:11,129
He's going to give it to
Ricardo if he loses?

231
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,030
It's publicity.
It's publicity.

232
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:16,431
It's something to tell the papers.

233
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:17,732
It's a story.

234
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:22,633
I am a samurai. Should this guardian
defeat me, I will surrender my fucking belt.

235
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,534
And will he?

236
00:18:25,135 --> 00:18:26,935
We're not selling tickets.

237
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:31,436
Sell the tickets, sell the show.
And we figure that out on the way to the bank.

238
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:34,137
The point is,
you've got to sell the show.

239
00:18:34,138 --> 00:18:35,738
Ricardo is the biggest thing in Brazil.

240
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,739
Read the street signs,
we're in America..

241
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,440
...Morisaki is doing his part.

242
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:43,541
You've got to do yours,
Ricardo's got to do his.

243
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,342
Where the fuck is he?

244
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:47,643
Pay per view is pulling back
on the promotion.

245
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:49,344
We need a gimmick.

246
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:51,345
One more time.

247
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:53,946
Ricardo brings the old man up
from Brazil.

248
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:56,247
He fights for the honor of his mentor.

249
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:59,748
Morisaki brings the belt,
he fights for the emperor.

250
00:18:59,749 --> 00:19:01,449
What do you got?
A grouch match.

251
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,050
It's back to the thirties.
Black against white.

252
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:07,551
Irish against Jew,
a racial grouch match.

253
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:10,052
Give me some velocity,
velocity.

254
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:12,753
Or else,
it's just two monkeys in the ring.

255
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:20,354
Yeah, we will speak English here in front
of my friend.

256
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:24,555
Marty Brown, this is my brother in law.
- Mike Terry, can I have a word with you?

257
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:29,356
We're trying to do business, Mike.

258
00:19:29,357 --> 00:19:30,457
What do you want?

259
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,558
I got to talk to you about money.
- Money?

260
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,459
Yeah.
- You want money?

261
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,860
I tell you what.

262
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:37,361
Fight on the under garden.

263
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:38,862
I'll put you in the under garden.

264
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:40,963
Round robin.
Winner takes home 50,000 dollar.

265
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:42,764
You got a good chance of take
home the money.

266
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,065
Fight on the under garden.

267
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,466
Joe Collins, the cop.

268
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:50,067
Joe Collins, the cop?
- Yeah, your bouncer.

269
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:54,768
He worked here several months, now he's...
- All right! All right, I got it.

270
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:56,169
Did you ever pay him?

271
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,470
Did I pay him?
- Yeah.

272
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:00,471
What the fuck do you care?

273
00:20:00,472 --> 00:20:01,472
Did you pay him?

274
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:03,973
No, I heard you but what business
is it of yours?

275
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:05,474
The guy has got a family.

276
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:07,675
I know what the fuck you are saying,
this guy has got a family

277
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:09,576
and I owe him some money.
And what?

278
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:11,777
Is this some business of yours?
- Did you pay him?

279
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,678
I told him as I recall.

280
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,379
He would have to wait for his money.
He got hotheaded and quit.

281
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,380
Yeah, this is Bruno Silva.
Put him on.

282
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:35,981
Chet Frank just walked into the bar,

283
00:20:35,982 --> 00:20:38,682
without his wife,
without his bodyguard.

284
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:41,883
No, no.
Get a news crew outside and...

285
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:43,684
Who did they get the tip from?

286
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:45,985
Some cabby driving by,
what the fuck do I care.

287
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:48,186
Chet Frank just walked into my bar.

288
00:20:48,187 --> 00:20:50,387
Would you call the newspapers?
Thank you.

289
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:53,888
Thank you for stopping by.
How's my sister?

290
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,689
I'll have paparinga.
- I'll have another one too.

291
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,490
I take care of the ladies drink.
- How you're doing these days, Chet?

292
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:05,791
Everything is a fucking struggle, you know?
- Take the high ground, Chet.

293
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:07,892
Yeah, right.
- The lady thanks you.

294
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,193
Anything for beauty.

295
00:21:09,194 --> 00:21:12,994
Nobody's tough when it comes to beauty.
- Indeed, indeed.

296
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:14,195
Excuse me.
- My pleasure.

297
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:16,896
I'd like to buy that,
she's a friend of mine.

298
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:18,997
I admire your taste.
- What?

299
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:21,998
I'm sorry, what did you say?
- I said, I admire your taste.

300
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,499
Yeah I heard what you said,
I just don't know what it means.

301
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,200
All right.
- What does it mean?

302
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,101
Whatever you want it to mean.

303
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:31,102
I've had a tough day.
- And what the fuck is that to me!

304
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:33,303
Fucking tough guy in the movies.
- Look...

305
00:21:33,304 --> 00:21:36,304
Hey, where is your protection tough guy?
- I didn't know that you knew the woman.

306
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:39,005
Well, you insulted me and
then you insulted the young woman

307
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,806
and don't you have a wife?

308
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:43,407
Yeah, didn't I actually read
that you have a wife?

309
00:21:43,408 --> 00:21:45,808
You come here for fighting or
you come here for a drink?

310
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:47,909
Maybe you came to the wrong
fucking place.

311
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,510
You know what?
- Just calm down.

312
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:51,811
Let me go, man. I'm calm.
You fucking calm down.

313
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:53,812
Just cam down.
Have a seat.

314
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,813
Have some ideas?

315
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,814
I don't think you do.
- Oh, I don't?

316
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:02,315
I just want to have a drink.

317
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:10,416
Come on. How you like that, man?
Come on. Take that!

318
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:16,617
All right, make a lane.

319
00:22:59,318 --> 00:23:01,818
Hey, baby.
You can hear me.

320
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:04,019
You can hear me.

321
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,020
I'm all right.

322
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,421
Do you think he's got a guy
or something?

323
00:23:11,422 --> 00:23:13,122
I'm sure they made the call.

324
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:17,123
Hey pal, why did you come out alone?

325
00:23:17,824 --> 00:23:22,624
You looking for trouble?
- Huh?

326
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:28,025
He's ok.
He's all right.

327
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:44,826
You banished the professor down here?

328
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:57,327
Here you go.

329
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:02,928
I thought Joey was on the door?
- No.

330
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:09,429
Hey Mike, what the fuck happened?
- I don't know some kind of bar fight.

331
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,130
Show it to me.

332
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:19,531
What we're talking about here?
- A couple of bad boys jumped on a movie star.

333
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:21,032
How about that?

334
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:23,433
Loomis says him out of the ambulance.

335
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:26,534
What happened to them,
they fall down?

336
00:24:26,535 --> 00:24:29,335
Something like that, I think.

337
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:33,336
Our friend here is all by himself.

338
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:36,437
Jesus Christ!

339
00:24:36,438 --> 00:24:40,238
You got the tape, I never threw a punch.

340
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,839
I am a stone cold victim.

341
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,840
What happened to the other guys?
- How would I know?

342
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:49,841
What about you?

343
00:24:50,442 --> 00:24:53,042
Nobody knows who I am.

344
00:25:32,743 --> 00:25:37,043
You didn't get the loan?
- Ricardo wasn't there.

345
00:25:37,044 --> 00:25:39,744
Did you ask Bruno for it?

346
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:44,745
He didn't ask for it.

347
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:49,246
Are you afraid of money?

348
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:53,747
You tell me how we can run
the academy without money?

349
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:58,548
You tell me that, so I can do it.
And not disturb you in your purity.

350
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:01,549
How am I going to run my business,
all the time you need me.

351
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,850
All the time, all my money
is going to yours.

352
00:26:06,451 --> 00:26:09,451
There are some things,
I don't understand.

353
00:26:11,452 --> 00:26:15,352
My father made money,
my brothers make money

354
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:19,053
and you are somehow to pure.

355
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:22,754
You're to pure to compete.

356
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:24,955
It weakens the fighter.
- That's right.

357
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:28,956
Because the competition is not a fight.
- That's correct.

358
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:33,657
And what about the fighters family,
Mike?

359
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:36,458
What are they going to eat?

360
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:39,059
While he is being so pure.

361
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,760
I have to take money from my business,
which is making money.

362
00:26:45,161 --> 00:26:48,561
If you replace the window,
you can't pay your rent.

363
00:26:48,562 --> 00:26:51,762
The insurance will replace the window.

364
00:26:51,763 --> 00:26:54,063
Do you want to turn your friend in?

365
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:56,864
Your precious friend?
- Yeah.

366
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,065
Your proudest student?

367
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,766
The policeman?

368
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:04,867
The girl tried to kill him,
and he let her go.

369
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:06,768
The girl, if he turned her in.

370
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:09,269
The cops would have said it was
attempted murder.

371
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,770
And wasn't it?
- It was an accidental discharge.

372
00:27:12,771 --> 00:27:15,671
Was it?
- She is disturbed. All right?

373
00:27:15,672 --> 00:27:18,872
The girl was disturbed.
- And now well, you adopt her?

374
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:21,573
She walks into your academy
and so you take responsibility for her crime?

375
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:24,474
They would have prosecuted her,
she would have gone to jail.

376
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:27,475
It would have ruined her life.
And so yes, he gave her a pass.

377
00:27:27,476 --> 00:27:30,876
I knew you think it was noble.
The code of the warrior.

378
00:27:30,877 --> 00:27:33,077
Do you think it is noble?
- No, I think it is correct.

379
00:27:33,078 --> 00:27:37,878
Well, that's fine. Except, as
we reported the wind blew in the window.

380
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:41,379
It was an act of God and not covered
under a specific policy.

381
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,480
And so, until we find the money

382
00:27:43,481 --> 00:27:46,781
we have to live with a broken window.

383
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,982
And you tell me how that
brings money into your business.

384
00:27:53,183 --> 00:27:55,083
Hello.

385
00:27:55,584 --> 00:27:58,584
Hi Niki.
Yeah.

386
00:27:58,585 --> 00:28:02,085
No, I can't order the new fabric now.

387
00:28:02,386 --> 00:28:04,586
No, I can't.

388
00:28:05,187 --> 00:28:07,287
I can't.

389
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:10,488
Of course I am going to re-order.

390
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:16,089
Ok.
Niki, I'll see you in ten minutes, ok?

391
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,190
Ok, bye.

392
00:28:20,391 --> 00:28:22,391
Now I have to fix the window.

393
00:28:22,392 --> 00:28:28,392
Where am I getting the cash to buy the new fabric
for my business? Without which we cannot eat.

394
00:28:28,393 --> 00:28:30,393
One moment.

395
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:34,394
Where did you get that cut?

396
00:28:37,795 --> 00:28:39,895
Thank you.

397
00:28:39,896 --> 00:28:42,296
It's for you.

398
00:28:48,997 --> 00:28:50,697
What is it?

399
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:52,498
It's an invitation.

400
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:55,399
Who is it from?
- From Chet Frank.

401
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,800
Chet Frank? - Yeah, we're invited
to his house for dinner tonight.

402
00:29:01,301 --> 00:29:04,801
To Chet Frank's house?
- That's right.

403
00:29:16,402 --> 00:29:18,402
Really?

404
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:32,003
Where is Joe? - Oh Mike, tell him.
What's the best weapon in the world.

405
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:34,304
The best weapon in the world is a flashlight.
- Tell him why.

406
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,905
So you can look deep in the other guys eyes.

407
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:39,706
I heard they had a dust stop at the Sao Paula
last night. - Is that right?

408
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:43,007
Yeah, two motherfuckers ran to Quisonar.
- You can't believe everything you hear.

409
00:29:43,008 --> 00:29:45,208
Fucking Lennie and Loomis saw the tape.

410
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:47,309
They said it was better than Thai-tanic!

411
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,810
We're going to ride or you still getting pretty?
- I'll be right out.

412
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:53,411
I wished I was there Mike?
- I wish I was there too. Hey Mike.

413
00:29:53,412 --> 00:29:56,112
Did you calm down because of that thing?

414
00:29:56,113 --> 00:29:57,813
Thing? What thing?

415
00:29:57,814 --> 00:30:00,214
I got something for you.

416
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:06,715
No?
- Yeah.

417
00:30:08,116 --> 00:30:11,216
I don't deserve it.
- Yes, you do.

418
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:14,517
The belt is just symbolic.

419
00:30:14,518 --> 00:30:18,618
The belt, as Snowflake says, is just
to keep your pants up.

420
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,419
Thank you.

421
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,420
One thing.
- What?

422
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:32,021
You said a reminder about the thing.

423
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:34,322
The thing with the girl,
that never happened.

424
00:30:34,323 --> 00:30:37,323
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

425
00:30:41,024 --> 00:30:44,824
Open it later.
- What is it?

426
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:47,425
Well, it's a wristwatch.

427
00:30:47,426 --> 00:30:50,026
Yours? Who's is it?
- It's yours.

428
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:53,927
I set you up with a job with my people
who did stiffed you.

429
00:30:53,928 --> 00:30:57,328
Yeah, you went to the club?
- Why you didn't tell me they weren't paying you?

430
00:30:57,329 --> 00:31:00,529
You know, I...
- Well, they paid you now.

431
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:05,330
That thing, take it.
Take your wife to the mountains.

432
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:09,331
What does the black belt mean?

433
00:31:09,332 --> 00:31:13,332
That I represent the academy.
- Then respect your teacher.

434
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:32,933
Hey, what's going on?

435
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:37,634
Who ordered this?
Who's paying for this?

436
00:31:50,935 --> 00:31:55,435
Mr Terry, I'm hardly ashamed of what I did.
I am so sorry.

437
00:31:55,436 --> 00:31:59,436
I will of course make it well. This is a cheque,
for the damage I did to your car.

438
00:31:59,437 --> 00:32:03,337
And I would like to contact the police officer
to thank him, for what he did.

439
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,738
I don't know what you're talking about.

440
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:07,439
Mr Terry, I'm an attorney.
I know what the officer did.

441
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,140
Out of courtesy, he reframed from
actions that might have sent me to jail,

442
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:15,341
or to some institutions.
- Hey, baby.

443
00:32:15,342 --> 00:32:17,242
Hey, Richard.

444
00:32:17,243 --> 00:32:18,943
Hey, who do you like in the
Morisaki fight?

445
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:22,544
I'm sure one of them is going to win.
- A little word from a little bird.

446
00:32:22,545 --> 00:32:24,345
Yeah, I don't play that.

447
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:26,946
Well if you did, who would you like?
- I can't help you, Richard.

448
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:28,947
You sure? Because if you help me,
I am going to help you.

449
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:30,248
That's the word to the wise.

450
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:32,949
On this fight, it's sufficient to put some
groceries money in your pocket.

451
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,350
Who does it hurt, Mike?
- I can't help you, Richard.

452
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:39,451
You know as much as me.
- I know as much as you?

453
00:32:46,452 --> 00:32:48,452
Mr Terry,

454
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:52,453
as you can see, I...

455
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:56,454
I have a problem,
I have something of a problem.

456
00:32:57,055 --> 00:33:02,355
Is there someway,
that I can help you?

457
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:14,756
You work with the police?

458
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:17,057
I've trained the police.

459
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:20,158
And what do all the belts mean?

460
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,959
The white belt is someone who walks
in of the street.

461
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,160
The black belt is someone that the teacher
recognizes is fit to instruct.

462
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:29,561
In between we have blue, purple and brown.

463
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:35,162
What do you have to do,
to get a red belt?

464
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:37,463
There is only one.

465
00:33:37,964 --> 00:33:41,464
All right, I'm not going to touch you.

466
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:47,165
But if you would have hold me,
could I strike you?

467
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:51,266
If you put your arms around me
and hold me, could I strike you?

468
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:53,867
With your knees.

469
00:33:53,968 --> 00:33:57,668
If you turned your body slightly,
and grassed me

470
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:01,369
could I strike you from there?

471
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,370
No. No!
- What?

472
00:34:11,371 --> 00:34:15,371
Could I strike you now?
- No.

473
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:18,172
Where can I strike you?

474
00:34:33,773 --> 00:34:36,173
Don't stand there.

475
00:34:40,474 --> 00:34:43,174
An enrollment form,

476
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:47,675
if you wish to continue your instruction.

477
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:05,876
Yeah.

478
00:35:05,877 --> 00:35:08,377
I am looking at cinaty 7-c,
I got it.

479
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:11,378
Well, an office is good as a feast.

480
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,779
Ok, let's take a walk.
Come on.

481
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,780
Excuse me, but I have to ask you.
Where did you get your dress?

482
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,681
I made it.
- Oh, she made it.

483
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:23,182
Oh, did you do your coat too?
Where did you get the fabric?

484
00:35:23,183 --> 00:35:24,883
The fabric?
I made that too.

485
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:28,784
You made that?
- Yeah, since I was a kid in Rio.

486
00:35:28,885 --> 00:35:32,285
You made the fabric?
- Yeah, I have a company in Brazil.

487
00:35:32,286 --> 00:35:35,286
No, I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

488
00:35:35,287 --> 00:35:38,387
Come and sit down. Lucy and I just
wrote a book about fabrics.

489
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,388
Really?
- Yes.

490
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:43,589
We have a company.
She has her decrement in textiles.

491
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,790
I love this fabric.

492
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:48,491
I have some people,
my family's people in Brazil

493
00:35:48,492 --> 00:35:51,092
and their the ones that bring..
- I love this fabric.

494
00:35:51,093 --> 00:35:52,193
Really?
- Yes.

495
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:54,794
I would love..
If you guys want, I can show you more..

496
00:35:54,795 --> 00:35:56,895
..I have tons of..
- Of course.

497
00:35:56,896 --> 00:35:58,896
So what is Ju-Jitsu?

498
00:35:58,897 --> 00:36:02,397
You use the fighters strength against him?

499
00:36:02,398 --> 00:36:04,398
Yes, in a way.

500
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:08,499
You let him use his strength,
and you use your understanding.

501
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,800
So it's a form of wrestling?

502
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:12,201
Yeah.

503
00:36:12,202 --> 00:36:15,602
Like we see in the mixed martial arts
competition? - Yeah, that's right.

504
00:36:15,603 --> 00:36:17,803
Do you compete?
- No.

505
00:36:17,804 --> 00:36:22,104
Because...?
- Competition is weakening.

506
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:24,905
Because it's fixed.

507
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:27,306
Two guys in the ring,
people betting money.

508
00:36:27,307 --> 00:36:30,907
Maybe fixed?
Anyone fight, maybe fixed.

509
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:36,208
But you train people to fight.
- No, I train people to prevail.

510
00:36:37,209 --> 00:36:39,509
In the street, in the alley

511
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,210
in combat.

512
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:46,211
The bodyguard, the cop, the soldiers.
One rule, put the other guy down.

513
00:36:46,212 --> 00:36:48,912
Now, you have to train them
to do that and any..

514
00:36:48,913 --> 00:36:52,413
any staged contests must have rules.

515
00:36:52,414 --> 00:36:56,414
Everything has rules, the problem
is stick 'em to them.

516
00:36:59,015 --> 00:37:02,115
Your wife, she's a beautiful woman.

517
00:37:02,116 --> 00:37:04,916
Thank you.

518
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:09,917
Yes, she is.

519
00:37:10,118 --> 00:37:14,918
Booz, women. What in this life
doesn't get you in trouble?

520
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:20,519
Turn to the side.
Everything has a force.

521
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Embrace it or deflect it.
Why oppose it?

522
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:29,721
How you're doing?
You're healing up?

523
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:33,522
I'm good.
- Well, you're young.

524
00:37:34,923 --> 00:37:40,023
So there's a neck-line, the waist-line
and the hem-line. Right?

525
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,324
Right.

526
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:46,225
So, if you bring the hem-line down
in this direction.

527
00:37:46,526 --> 00:37:49,826
It gives a better rhythm, right?
- Yeah.

528
00:37:49,827 --> 00:37:53,927
If you repeat and the fabric is..
..one foot. Let's say.

529
00:37:53,928 --> 00:37:56,028
Repeat at one foot?
That's too costly.

530
00:37:56,029 --> 00:37:58,829
That's what I'm saying.
Not from my people in Brazil.

531
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,230
And you can get this fabric?

532
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:03,331
Absolute, and make their fabric
and have it to you in a week.

533
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:07,332
Yeah?
- He's got to be on the set in five hours.

534
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:10,033
Let's let these nice people go home.

535
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:13,034
Sure honey.
Two heroes to obey.

536
00:38:21,335 --> 00:38:24,335
Thanks, pal.
- You're welcome.

537
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:28,636
Jerry, take care of that thing
for tomorrow morning. - You bet ya.

538
00:38:28,637 --> 00:38:31,937
Movies, we get up early in the morning
like in the military.

539
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:35,238
You were in the military?
- Yes, I was.

540
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,339
I've never seen Chet socialize on
a school night.

541
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,840
The guy saved his life.

542
00:38:42,741 --> 00:38:44,540
Zena.
- Thank you.

543
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:49,241
Tomorrow, I want to see you tomorrow.
Those are all my numbers, right there.

544
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:52,242
Mike.

545
00:38:53,443 --> 00:38:56,043
Mike, tell them the story.
Oh no, they want to go to bed.

546
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:58,044
Come on, baby.
Tell them the story.

547
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:00,745
The fight is before a fight.
- Three marbles.

548
00:39:00,746 --> 00:39:03,546
Each fighter has a two and three odds
of choosing the white marble.

549
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:04,847
White marble is a pass.

550
00:39:04,848 --> 00:39:07,648
White marble is a pass?
What if he picks the black marble?

551
00:39:07,649 --> 00:39:10,449
Black marble is a handicap.
- What does that mean a handicap?

552
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,450
No, you lose the use of an arm or...

553
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:15,351
Because you never know
when you maybe disabled.

554
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:17,352
Thank you, for a beautiful evening.

555
00:39:17,353 --> 00:39:20,153
Thank you for having us
to your lovely home.

556
00:39:20,154 --> 00:39:24,154
In fact it's a handicap.
Do they do that in competitions?

557
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:26,255
No.
- No? They should.

558
00:39:26,256 --> 00:39:30,456
A lot of money in that.
It will be like a reality show.

559
00:39:30,457 --> 00:39:34,657
Chet wants you to come down to the
set in the morning. Can you do that?

560
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:36,858
Yeah, ok.

561
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:48,559
Mike, over here.

562
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,960
Yeah, hold on.

563
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:54,461
Chet is a little bit late.
He's a little bit late.

564
00:39:54,462 --> 00:39:56,862
What do we need to make you comfortable?
Abbey?

565
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:58,663
Yes, Jerry?
- Give him a script.

566
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:02,364
Put him in the trailer if he wants.
Chet is running late.

567
00:40:02,665 --> 00:40:04,965
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Abbey!

568
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,966
Pay attention.
Will you pay attention?

569
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:16,867
Come on. What you going to do,
stab me with your purse?

570
00:40:16,868 --> 00:40:18,668
Come on.

571
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:21,469
No, no, no.
This is bullshit.

572
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:24,070
You got to stab me with the fucking thing.
- I'm trying, George.

573
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:26,271
Well, try harder.
Let's go!

574
00:40:26,272 --> 00:40:29,772
Come on.
Come on, stick me!

575
00:40:29,773 --> 00:40:32,773
Come on.
Come on.

576
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:35,474
You got to make it real.

577
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,875
You got to make it real.

578
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:41,176
Are you listening to me?
Or am I talking to a fucking wall?

579
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:47,877
Make it look real.
You got to make it look real.

580
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:51,778
Chet is not going to look real,
if you don't make him look real.

581
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:54,379
Anybody could do this fucking move.

582
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,280
You? Yeah, you.
- Me?

583
00:40:57,281 --> 00:41:00,081
I'm going to show him
how to do the fucking move.

584
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:04,082
Take the knife. It's not going to hurt you.
It's rubber.

585
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:08,783
Mike, what the fuck are you doing here?

586
00:41:08,784 --> 00:41:10,184
I don't know.
I got asked by Jerry Weiss.

587
00:41:10,185 --> 00:41:13,685
Are you coming on the show?
- No, it just got all wannabe.

588
00:41:13,686 --> 00:41:16,686
Did he ask if you're in the military?
- Yeah.

589
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:20,687
Did you tell him what you did?
- No, he didn't ask.

590
00:41:21,888 --> 00:41:26,088
You take the fucking knife.
He's Chet. I am you.

591
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:29,089
You take the fucking knife
and you...

592
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:34,090
Well, what we have here is a wise guy.

593
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:11,191
How the fuck are you?
- I'm good.

594
00:42:11,192 --> 00:42:13,592
I don't want to take up any of your time.
- No, fuck.

595
00:42:13,593 --> 00:42:15,993
We're shooting something else.
There's always something else to shoot.

596
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:18,394
Step in my office.

597
00:42:20,295 --> 00:42:22,895
What are we shooting today?

598
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,769
Meet me

599
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,769
0-Dark-3080C.

600
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,539
I never served.

601
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,839
I know I didn't miss anything.

602
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,470
What are you going to say?

603
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,540
But how would I know?

604
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,049
This fucking guy who locked out.
- Here you go, Chet.

605
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,480
Yeah, I'm just a fucking guy who locked out.

606
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,060
I drink too much.

607
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,499
I fool around.

608
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,800
Do you know how hard it is
for a man to step out?

609
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,270
A famous man.

610
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,400
And who can you trust?

611
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,500
What were you doing in the bar?

612
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,909
I wanted to get a drink.
- Why didn't you bring your protection?

613
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,910
I wanted to get into a fight.

614
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,519
Why didn't you fight him then?
- I wanted to beat him.

615
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:14,949
What are you a psychiatrist?
- No, I'm a fighter.

616
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,259
If that isn’t strong enough,
you tell me.

617
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,059
Thanks.

618
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,029
What are we shooting today?
- Golf war flashback.

619
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:23,930
That's right.

620
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,620
It's not my department.

621
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,970
What are these numbers doing on my boot?

622
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,130
If the guy been at combat,
they would have been worn of.

623
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,969
I mean the sizes would have worn of, right?
- It's not the sizes.

624
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,460
No?

625
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,040
The guys in the desert,

626
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,740
ink their numbers
in their platoon on their boots.

627
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,449
Anyway if their legs got blown off
or their bodies got blown apart,

628
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:48,440
somebody in their platoon would know
who it was.

629
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,230
0-Dark-30.

630
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,000
EOC.

631
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,800
What does EOC mean?
- Es on curb.

632
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,340
Es on curb.

633
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,540
That's good.

634
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,310
But is that something a guy would say?
- He might.

635
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,710
It's hold on me, world war II.

636
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:18,349
Maybe the guy learnt it from the guy.
He's good.

637
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,319
You're free tonight?
You, me and Jerry.

638
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,319
I want to meet over in Fiori's,
have to be raff.

639
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,020
I want to make you a co-producer
on this film.

640
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,630
Yeah, hey this is Mike Terry.

641
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,930
Yeah, George Coreani asked me
to sent me some materials.

642
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,069
Yeah, I found it.
Do you want me to fax it to you?

643
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,179
Ok, I'm going to fax it.
I going to have dinner with Jerry and Chet tonight.

644
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,980
Yeah, ok.

645
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:51,880
They want to put it in the movie.

646
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,840
They put what in the movie?

647
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,580
This desert storm is a bunch of combat...

648
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,090
George is doing it.
George is doing the stunts.

649
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,389
George is doing their stunts?
- Yeah.

650
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,999
And why they want you for?

651
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,200
They want me to be a producer.

652
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,109
What does that mean?

653
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,700
To begin with,
they want to use my training idea.

654
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,510
Golf war, they training for hand to hand.

655
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:21,309
The captain in the film, he's training
the guys using my training methods.

656
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,619
Two seconds.
Sondra Terry?

657
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,410
Lucy, hi.

658
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,919
Yes, yes.
I'll be right up.

659
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,929
Yeah, I'll bring you the sample.

660
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,420
Ok, bye.

661
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,929
Sorry baby, you were saying?
- They want me to be the producer.

662
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:42,430
I'm going to the set,
and then I am going to dinner with...

663
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,930
What?

664
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,760
What?

665
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,530
Who's going to take the beginners class?

666
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,540
Baby, let the wheel come around.

667
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,780
Just let it come around.

668
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,189
Sometimes you can just let
the wheel come around.

669
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,289
I can't just cancel the class.
What kind of message does that sent?

670
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:05,890
You made Joe a black belt.
Right?

671
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,290
And so he is qualified to aprove
the honor of the academy.

672
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,790
Let him teach the class.

673
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,730
Let him teach the class.

674
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,731
Ok.

675
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,010
Let the wheel come around.

676
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,150
Good for you.

677
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,450
I got to go.

678
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,130
See you later, ok?

679
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,460
Their going to take me in their company.

680
00:46:51,161 --> 00:46:52,561
Ciao.

681
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,340
Yeah, this is Mike Terry.

682
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,380
Yeah, did you get the fax that I just sent you?

683
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,779
Ok, good.
Yeah, I'm going through the whole script here.

684
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,220
Yeah, it's all about authenticity.

685
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,280
Am I supposed to meditate?

686
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,020
No, just...

687
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:18,080
sit for a moment.

688
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,530
All right.

689
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,100
I don't understand.

690
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,330
The first step is the hardest.
- And what is the first step?

691
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,500
To leave the outside, outside.

692
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,850
I think, I've come to the wrong place.

693
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,150
I'm so sorry.

694
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:56,429
Conquer your fear and
you'll conquer your opponent.

695
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,030
Yes.

696
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,760
Mr Terry,

697
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:05,490
a man raped me.

698
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,109
He held a knife to my throat

699
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,010
a man twice my size.

700
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,170
And then he raped me.

701
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,379
He held a knife to your throat?
- Yes, look I..

702
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,670
I appreciate what you have done,
it's just..

703
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:23,780
I don't think there's anything
that I could learn here that would really...

704
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:26,429
There is no situation
that you cannot escape from.

705
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:30,629
There is no situation that you cannot
turn to your advantage.

706
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,620
A man was going to cut my throat.

707
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,390
Like this?

708
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,939
Don't move. There's a knife there.

709
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,200
There's a knife there.
Grab my arm.

710
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,009
Drag it toward me.

711
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:43,109
Toward me.
- Good.

712
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,539
Move to the right, move to the right
and behind me.

713
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,610
Move to the right and behind me.
Good, now stab me with the knife.

714
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,050
Good, stab me with the knife.

715
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,210
Good, stab me with the knife.

716
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,820
Stab me with the knife.

717
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,359
Let's hear it.
Let it out.

718
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,560
Let it out.

719
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,260
Let it out.

720
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,970
It's all right.

721
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,650
There's nobody here but the fighters.

722
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,780
Yeah.

723
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,540
Yeah, this is Mike Terry.

724
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,850
Yeah, I put that stuff together for you.

725
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,190
Yeah, well eh...

726
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,650
It is good.
Yeah.

727
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,860
Yeah. No, I'm working on the script now.

728
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,890
Yeah.

729
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,770
Ok.
No, thank you.

730
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,370
Hey Joe, thanks for coming in.

731
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:52,380
I want you to take the evening class.
White belts.

732
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,310
Hit escape, escape the mount,
pass the board, arm ball.

733
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:04,219
What time you go on your shift?
- I've been suspended.

734
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,650
The wristwatch was hot.

735
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,759
The wristwatch?
- The gold watch.

736
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,729
The guy gave you, you gave me.

737
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:14,469
I pound it, it was hot.
- It was hot?

738
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:15,969
Two dollar pistol.
- You pound it?

739
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:16,830
I did.

740
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,569
The pound shop called it in.

741
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:22,479
The captain wants to know what I am
doing with a hot $20.000 dollar watch.

742
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,279
What did you tell him?
- I told him..

743
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,040
I told him, I got to tell him tomorrow.

744
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,070
He suspended me.

745
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,750
You told him where you got the watch?

746
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,350
I didn't want to hurt the academy.

747
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,089
I couldn't tell him you gave me a hot watch.

748
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,460
No, no.
Let me clean it up, it's easy.

749
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,190
It's easy.

750
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,859
It's easy?
- Yeah, these guys..

751
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,869
..these guys. I'm sure, the guy who gave
me the watch. He got stiffed, it's easy.

752
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:52,669
I'm sure he want to know.
Take the class, sweat it out.

753
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:54,070
Sweat it out.

754
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,070
It's ok, Joe.
It's easy.

755
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:20,760
Sorry, I'm late.

756
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:25,539
Chet might be shooting till down.
If he raps early, he will come down.

757
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,239
He sent his regrets.

758
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,770
Here's what he wanted to talk to you about.

759
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,939
And you should get a lawyer because he wants
to make a business arrangement with you.

760
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:37,149
He's got some big ideas.
Some of them might be even be mine.

761
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:40,679
Here's one of them.
This could be money.

762
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:44,289
What would you like to drink?
Wine?

763
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,189
No, I'm good.
- You don't drink?

764
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,659
I used to.
- You don't anymore?

765
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,090
Jerry.

766
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,460
There's a problem and
I need you to help me to work it out.

767
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,999
Of course.

768
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,869
It's eh...
Its difficult for me to say.

769
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:02,300
That's way I know.
Spit it out.

770
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,800
Chet gave me a lavish gift.

771
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,709
A lavish gift.
- All right.

772
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:09,409
There was a money issue and
I asked a friend of mine to pound it.

773
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:11,950
To pound it?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

774
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:16,440
Chet sends you a wristwatch
and you pound it?

775
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,820
Hey, look...

776
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,920
He gave it to you. It's yours to
do with it as you want.

777
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:23,159
Hey.
- How you're doing?

778
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:24,420
You got a minute?

779
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,559
I catch up with you.
- I got something, I think Chet might like.

780
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,860
Well, I'm coming right over.
- I'm going to call you about it.

781
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,060
Ok.

782
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,239
Somebody pound the watch
that Chet gave you?

783
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,530
And he was told the watch was stolen.
- Stolen?

784
00:53:37,531 --> 00:53:38,531
Yeah.

785
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,580
Son of a bitch.

786
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,580
Some motherfucker sold..

787
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:46,349
Someone sold Chet Frank a hot watch.

788
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:49,050
I can't use the cell phone in here.

789
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:52,289
I'm going to use the phone in the front.
I'm going to clean this up right now.

790
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,130
But she gave me this number.

791
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,270
Mrs. Frank gave me this number.

792
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,349
I called the other number
and it's out of service.

793
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,050
It's out of service.

794
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:53,749
Thanks.

795
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,840
Their numbers are all out of service.

796
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,189
How come it's out of service
if they gave it to me yesterday?

797
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:01,829
Who?
- Zena Frank.

798
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,620
I had a meeting with Jerry.

799
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,400
They've changed the number.

800
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,999
I've ordered $30.000 dollar of the fabric.

801
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,139
I placed an order to Brazil for
$30.000 dollar of the fabric.

802
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,830
Lucy Wise, please.

803
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:18,810
She's on vacation?

804
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:23,310
She won't take my call.

805
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,219
I had a meeting with Jerry.

806
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,649
What did you do to screw this up?

807
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:29,749
You placed an order to Brazil.
- What did you do to make them act this way?

808
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,819
You placed an order to Brazil for $30.000 dollar.

809
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,229
Yes.
- Why?

810
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,129
Zena told me it was a done deal.

811
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:37,159
Their were going to use my fabric in their shop.

812
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,650
Where did you get the credit?

813
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:42,029
What?
- Where did you get $30.000 dollar credit?

814
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,069
I paid cash.

815
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,769
What?
- I paid cash.

816
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:47,239
Are you deaf?
Do you know what's happening to my life, Mike?

817
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,540
Where did you get the cash?

818
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,339
I took out a personal loan for two weeks.

819
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,679
I was going to get the fabric..

820
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,679
We...

821
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,449
I was going to be a part of their company.

822
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,380
You took out a personal loan

823
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:01,819
for $30.000 dollar for two weeks.
From whom?

824
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:03,619
It was a done deal.

825
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,080
Yes, but now it's not a done deal.

826
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:07,189
I wasn't even going to need it
for two weeks, Mike.

827
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,729
They told me, they were writing their cheque.

828
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:11,329
Who gave you the loan?

829
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,000
Richard gave me the loan.

830
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,800
You borrowed $30.0000 dollar
from a loan shop?

831
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,310
Are you crazy?

832
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:34,819
She spent it.

833
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,220
She spent it?

834
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,350
She spent the $30.000 dollar I gave her.
- That's right.

835
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,950
She said she wanted
the money for two weeks.

836
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:42,759
She spent it.

837
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,850
What the fuck am I going to do?

838
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:49,870
What can you give me?

839
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,930
How soon could you get it to me?

840
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,269
Richie.

841
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,830
If you could carry me?

842
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,879
The money isn’t mine, Mike.

843
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,279
The money isn’t mine...

844
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,409
I gave it out of my word. But I owe
that money to my guys, you understand?

845
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,070
It isn’t mine.

846
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,690
What do you own that you could turn to cash?
What do you got what you could liquidate?

847
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,680
Something for you?

848
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:16,029
<i>It's an Asian-samurai training technique going back
to the 17th century.</i>

849
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,629
<i>Every fighter in the tournament,</i>

850
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,690
<i>each match, each fighter
will pick a marble.</i>

851
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:23,191
<i>Should he pick a white marble,
he'll be giving a pass.</i>

852
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,499
<i>Should he pick a black marble,
he'll be given a handicap.</i>

853
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,909
<i>So the fighters on the Undercard, each one
could get a handicap? - That's right.</i>

854
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,109
<i>The samurai say that's this..</i>

855
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,810
What do you got what's worth money?

856
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:39,410
<i>..where one can never tell
if they might become disabled.</i>

857
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,019
<i>So there you have the Under card,
in the main event we have bad blood..</i>

858
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:45,120
<i>evidentially between Morisaki and your
brother Ricardo Silva.</i>

859
00:57:45,122 --> 00:57:48,129
<i>Morisaki feels like he's been insulted.
- That is correct, it is.</i>

860
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:52,859
<i>Unfortunate, but this competition has start into
a grouch match between my brother and Morisaki.</i>

861
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,029
Under the laws of intellectual property,

862
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:56,439
the copyright

863
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:02,969
that is the possession of the idea and
all profits from its exploitation belongs to Mr. Terry.

864
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,609
The three marbles.

865
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:06,279
You can't copyright an idea?

866
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,479
You can't copyright an idea but you can
copyright a particular expression,

867
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,719
which my client has done through use
to exploitation of his system

868
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,289
in order to earn his living.

869
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,389
Into historical form.

870
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:17,489
Which idea...
- It's a historical form.

871
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,589
It's not a historical form. That's nonsense.
- The Japanese..

872
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:22,989
The idea was discovered in a Japanese
training manual of the 19th century.

873
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,929
You show it to me in one historical document,
we'll pack up and go home.

874
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:28,199
And you show me were your client
never transcribed ancient...

875
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,299
He has a document of his training regime
that he used for many years in his academy.

876
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,039
So he says,
and I'll give you that.

877
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,539
Who has ever seen this form
outside of his academy?

878
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,049
We can assume that the Silva's
and your client had access.

879
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,509
The presumption of access.
- You can assume whatever you want.

880
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:46,619
I believe the courts will conquer the relationship
between the parties being so close.

881
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,749
Is that your case?
Is that you want to roll the dice on?

882
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,719
Are you sure you want to play in this league?

883
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,019
What do they want?
Let's financesialize the problem.

884
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,769
No, no.

885
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,550
Please ask him to wait.

886
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:04,370
However...

887
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:07,200
My client is prepared to relinquish.

888
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,500
Today.

889
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,110
To relinquish all rights to his creation.

890
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:15,079
In return for what?
- In return for a payment of $200.000 dollar.

891
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,479
Payable today.
- That's a lot of money.

892
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,479
It's a great idea.
- It's a good idea.

893
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,080
It's a great idea or why would
you promoting it?

894
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,790
No, ask him to wait.

895
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,120
He's got to wait.

896
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,590
Your name could be here.

897
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:38,029
You want to make some money?
Fight on the under card. $50.000 dollar.

898
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,299
I saw you fight.
You've got a month to train.

899
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:44,230
You want to make some money?
Give me a call.

900
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:45,810
I will make you some money.

901
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:50,609
Thank you that is very generous.
Today we need a cash payment of $200.000 dollar.

902
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,319
You can't go in there.
- You know, I don't think so.

903
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:56,619
Mr. Brown, I tried to stop him.
- It's ok, it's your new partner.

904
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:05,029
It's Jerry Weiss, the producer.
I faxed him a copy of the train sheet.

905
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,639
It's a conspiracy.
You gave the one guy the information.

906
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,169
Who gave it to the other guy.
Who denied it.

907
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:20,379
As A: It's theft.
B: It's conspiracy to fraud.

908
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,749
You want to get cute? You threatening
with criminal prosecution into recon.

909
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:27,080
I'm glad I caught you.
- You are about to become a wealthy man.

910
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:30,849
You just blew your case back there, didn't you?
- If I can have just one moment.

911
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,859
I will need some time to formulate our new demands.
- Of course.

912
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,750
But I want to show you something.

913
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,599
Joseph Collins.
Los Angeles police.

914
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,669
On the night of June 12th,
you stole his weapon and fired on him.

915
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:43,999
Here is the ejected shell from his pistol.

916
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,470
It has your fingerprints on it.

917
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,169
Officer Collins did not file a report,
he's then also prosecutable

918
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:51,970
and we will see to it that he is prosecuted.

919
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,009
Prosecuted for?

920
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:55,410
He was witness to the attempted murder
on a police officer.

921
01:00:55,411 --> 01:00:56,419
Oh, please.

922
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,879
Which he suppressed.
- Why would he do that?

923
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,820
In exchange for a bribe.
- A bribe?.

924
01:00:59,821 --> 01:01:01,621
This will of course end his career with the
police department,

925
01:01:01,622 --> 01:01:04,522
and sent him as well as the person
who suborned him to jail.

926
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,150
Along with the assailant.

927
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,029
A bribe?

928
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,450
Your client gave him a wristwatch,
worth $20.000 dollar.

929
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:12,520
In exchange for his silence.

930
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,429
I contacted the officer and shared with
him the alternatives.

931
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:19,439
You withdraw your claim, or we will suspender him
and force him to incriminate you and Mr. Terry.

932
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,769
For, which he understands, you'll both stand trial.

933
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:23,340
How would you like to proceed?

934
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,540
I like to proceed directly to court.

935
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:31,840
From the academy I'll need all your notebooks
and journals from day one.

936
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:33,580
Thank you for your time.

937
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:36,140
Speak to nobody about this case
from now on.

938
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,050
You motherfucking son of a bitch.

939
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:10,619
What have I got?
What have I got? Nothing.

940
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:15,559
Nothing. Do you know what the pension is
for an officer who kills himself?

941
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:19,559
What is the pension of a suicide?

942
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,129
Do you know?

943
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:24,229
It's nothing.
Tell him.

944
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,330
Please don't touch that....

945
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,770
He didn't want to bring disgrace on you.

946
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,840
I have no husband.

947
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:38,349
I have no husband, I can't pay my bills.

948
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:42,489
I can't pay my rent.
And now I don't have even have his pension.

949
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:47,559
And for what? For what?
For your stupid principles?

950
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:52,790
You are a sick fool.
How am I going to live?

951
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,299
Who's going to pay these bills?
Are you?

952
01:02:57,370 --> 01:03:02,000
Are you?
Are you going to take care of me?

953
01:03:02,001 --> 01:03:04,001
I need you to step outside now.

954
01:03:05,002 --> 01:03:06,802
How about that?

955
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:29,720
Ok, copies of state regulation signed.

956
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:34,629
All right, we want to get the main on,
if possible by 11.00 pm.

957
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:38,629
First elimination Romero and Sanches.
- Right here. Here.

958
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:42,030
Up second Terry and Garcia.
- Yo.

959
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:44,530
The winner goes on to the second round.

960
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,940
All right, it's new but it's fairly straight forward.

961
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:54,739
As your match is called,
you will be walked to the ring.

962
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:59,070
We will now go to the ring then I will
release you to the Undercard room.

963
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:04,720
Nobody is allowed in the Undercard room,
but fighters and trainers.

964
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:09,489
Our part of the broadcast starts at 8.00 pm.

965
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,990
The broadcast starts at 8.00 pm.

966
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:16,799
We will be calling the first fight
at 8.15 pm.

967
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,439
So you'll take your corner.

968
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,800
The referee will call you out.

969
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:24,140
And an official will perform the ceremony.

970
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,009
The efficient,
he will be wearing this mask,

971
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:30,310
will show the bowl.

972
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,810
He will show the bowl and the marbles.

973
01:06:33,811 --> 01:06:37,011
He will then raise the bowl
and you will choose.

974
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,920
Black is the handicap.

975
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:44,060
The handicaps will be chosen by the referee.

976
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,320
They are:

977
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:47,829
Left arm bound.

978
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,530
Right arm bound.

979
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:02,509
Ok. If you have no questions, make your
way back to the Undercard room.

980
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,520
The spirit and honor of the samurai.

981
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,500
For those who it is a life style.

982
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:29,100
Good, good, good.

983
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:33,540
Sanchez and Romero.

984
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:41,050
Despite the sanctions by will be fought
under the rules of the California state commission.

985
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:46,510
While the fighters are in the ring, they will be
under the direct supervision of the referee.

986
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:49,129
Any judgment made will be final.

987
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:53,459
subject only to disqualification
pending a drug test.

988
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:58,330
Trainers, I want to see those credentials
and I want to see them signed.

989
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:04,570
According to the law, it is a legal procedure.

990
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:09,570
Signifying your acceptance of the rules
under the statutes of the state of California.

991
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:16,080
First up Sanchez and Romero.
First fight Sanchez and Romero.

992
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:21,089
And Dillon here is explaining what the
three possible handicaps could be.

993
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:22,489
What are they?
Break em down for us.

994
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:26,129
The basically draw from the bowl, a black
or two white marbles.

995
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:28,269
if you get a white marble,
you basically getting a pass.

996
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,299
If you draw the black marble, you're either
going to have one arm tied to your body

997
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,300
or potentially both arms tied to your body.

998
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,539
Or the application of a blindfold.
- Fighting with a blindfold?

999
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:39,139
Yeah, how's that sound?
- That sounds like fun.

1000
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:42,200
Well, it's going to be fun for the audience tonight.
Tell me something more...

1001
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:37,801
Great to be here tonight in this
explosion of mixed martial arts.

1002
01:09:37,802 --> 01:09:39,102
It's unbelievable.

1003
01:09:39,103 --> 01:09:41,803
Why do you think this sport
is so popular in America?

1004
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:00,120
Let's go on.

1005
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,890
Who are that back there?
- There you go.

1006
01:10:22,591 --> 01:10:27,391
Do you have your mouth piece?
Do you have your mouth piece? All right.

1007
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:37,792
Do you have your mouth piece?
Ok.

1008
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,150
Yeah, ok.
Just take it easy.

1009
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,069
Ladies and gentleman.

1010
01:11:54,570 --> 01:12:00,809
Bobby Sanchez has drawn the handicap
and he will fight one arm.

1011
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:07,880
Bobby Sanchez has drawn the handicap
and he will fight one arm.

1012
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:11,550
Welcome to the I.F.A.

1013
01:12:42,451 --> 01:12:44,551
Ok, fighters come forward.

1014
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,990
You got instructions in the dressing room.
Do you have any questions?

1015
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:55,850
Fight hard, fight free and fight fair.
Ok, touch gloves.

1016
01:12:55,951 --> 01:12:57,851
To your corners.

1017
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,990
Ok, here we go.

1018
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:03,191
Judge, judge, judge.

1019
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,810
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

1020
01:13:04,811 --> 01:13:06,711
Fight!

1021
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,840
Terry and Garcia on deck.

1022
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:47,140
Terry and Garcia.

1023
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:51,750
Terry and Garcia, next up.

1024
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,440
Stop, stop.
Stop!

1025
01:14:52,741 --> 01:14:55,441
Stay down, stay down.
Stay down.

1026
01:14:59,342 --> 01:15:01,942
He's out.
Controlled.

1027
01:15:03,643 --> 01:15:05,943
The Winner!

1028
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:20,800
The winner after
1 minute and 5 seconds in the first round,

1029
01:15:20,801 --> 01:15:23,301
Felix Romero.

1030
01:15:25,602 --> 01:15:29,562
Our next fight in 15 minutes will feature

1031
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:34,520
Mike Terry and Toro Garcia.

1032
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:43,520
This fight is sanctioned by, and will be conducted
under the rules of the California state commission.

1033
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:47,169
While the fighters are in the ring, they will
be under the disgracing of the referee.

1034
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:51,539
Any judgment rendered by the judge is final
pending the outcome of a drug test.

1035
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,039
Let's see the gloves.

1036
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,480
Your signed acknowledgement
and the physicians statement,

1037
01:15:55,481 --> 01:16:01,581
is a legal document signifying your acceptance
of the rules, under the rules of the state California.

1038
01:16:01,582 --> 01:16:04,282
Let's see the blue card.
All right.

1039
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:05,880
Let's go.

1040
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:08,990
Let's go, we got some people
waiting out there.

1041
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,080
Let's go.
Come on!

1042
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,129
From Los Angeles California,

1043
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:17,190
a well known figure in the martial arts world.

1044
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:22,800
A champions at close combat making
his first appearance in competition

1045
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:28,540
at 179 pounds, Mike Terry!

1046
01:16:28,841 --> 01:16:35,441
<i>$50.000 dollar for the winner of the tournament.
$50.000 dollar!</i>

1047
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,460
Excuse me, you can't smoke here.

1048
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,779
Well. I don't know about you Eddy,
but I love it.

1049
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:05,219
I think boxing is as dead at Woodrow Wilson.
- What a fight...

1050
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:08,180
I've got eyes on the fighters.
Their walking.

1051
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,189
Ok, handlers.

1052
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:14,280
Keep a hand on your boy, keep your eyes on me.
You know the drill.

1053
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:16,980
We've been to this before,
let's go.

1054
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,329
We'll be under here for about 15 minutes.

1055
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:22,530
Then the man will come through to
take you to the ring.

1056
01:17:22,531 --> 01:17:25,200
When you get to the ring,
listen to the referee.

1057
01:17:25,701 --> 01:17:27,201
Sorry.

1058
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,400
I'm handing him of,
I'm coming up now under the bleachers.

1059
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:33,839
The under card, what did we just see
in the first event?

1060
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,400
Here's what we saw,
here's what the I.F.A has done...

1061
01:17:36,601 --> 01:17:38,901
Eyes on the price, Mike.

1062
01:17:39,202 --> 01:17:40,902
This is your road game.

1063
01:17:41,903 --> 01:17:43,603
<i>There's Mike Terry, an unknown.</i>

1064
01:17:43,604 --> 01:17:46,620
<i>Hey Mike, you saw the fight.
What do you think of this new competition?</i>

1065
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:49,621
<i>One guy is ahead, how that would affect
you as a fighter?</i>

1066
01:17:49,822 --> 01:17:51,429
After the fight.

1067
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:53,230
Leave my guy alone.

1068
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:05,100
Goddamned shame, Mike.
Goddamned shame about Joey.

1069
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,170
He was my companion, Mike.

1070
01:18:12,571 --> 01:18:16,971
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we have a very
special guest with us tonight.</i>

1071
01:18:17,772 --> 01:18:20,972
<i>From Sao Paolo, Brazil.</i>

1072
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:24,020
<i>The red belt himself.</i>

1073
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:27,490
<i>The professor, the grandmaster.</i>

1074
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:30,790
<i>Joao Moro.</i>

1075
01:18:47,491 --> 01:18:51,191
You, the fighter.
Back up. Back up.

1076
01:18:51,292 --> 01:18:55,892
Back up. Get out of the way,
I need some room. Back it up.

1077
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:41,699
It's fixed.
- The fight is fixed?

1078
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,739
Of course it's fixed.
What the fuck do you think?

1079
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,959
What do you want?

1080
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:03,119
You brought the old man,
up from Brazil for this bullshit?

1081
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:05,450
You run your business,
I run mine.

1082
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:08,460
Who I brought to wear is of no
concern to you.

1083
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:12,169
His life, his teachings.
- What do you know of his teachings?

1084
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,240
What the hell do you know of his teachings?

1085
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:18,139
It's my family business,

1086
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:19,739
and it is a business, ok?

1087
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,540
What the hell did you think it is?

1088
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,840
There's television out there.

1089
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:28,040
It's about to be big business.
And nobody has forgotten you.

1090
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:30,250
So cool down and sit down.

1091
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:32,859
None of the fighters know that
the fight is fixed.

1092
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,090
You weren't suppose to know.

1093
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,259
You weren't suppose to know.
- I don't get it?

1094
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,750
We pick who get's the white marble.

1095
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,260
Here's what you missing.
Here's what you invented.

1096
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:45,900
The thing, it's not a way to insure
the fight is fair.

1097
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:49,169
Any two guys fighting for money,
no way the fight is fair.

1098
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:52,370
What you did is a way to fix the fight
without the fighters knowledge.

1099
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:54,409
You stole my idea.

1100
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:56,709
How about that?
So, look what?

1101
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:58,479
Who gets the pass tonight?
You.

1102
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,510
Every fight tonight,
the other guy gets the handicap.

1103
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:05,119
You win, you go home with $50.000 dollar.
You settle your various debts.

1104
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,319
How about that?
Make a name for yourself.

1105
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,829
I love a fighter.
What the fuck?

1106
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:13,559
All right. All right.
Ricardo has got to rest.

1107
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,729
Hold on?
- Are we done?

1108
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:16,520
And? And?
- Are we done?

1109
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:18,930
You come back in three months
for the re-match.

1110
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:22,030
Ricardo fights Morisaki to re-take the crown.

1111
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,840
You're throwing the fight tonight?

1112
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,430
Everything in life,
the money is in the re-match.

1113
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:30,140
Have you told him, he wins tonight?

1114
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:35,450
You throw the fight in front of the professor?

1115
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:37,640
The professor know the man.

1116
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,250
And he doesn't have a family to support.

1117
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,980
<i>Terry, Terry.</i>

1118
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,599
<i>15 minute warning on deck.</i>

1119
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,260
<i>15 minute warning.</i>

1120
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,570
A cop died.

1121
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:02,410
Everybody dies.
You want to help his widow?

1122
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:10,250
What about the stolen watch?

1123
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,820
My friend shot himself because somebody
gave me a hot watch.

1124
01:22:13,821 --> 01:22:15,829
A fellow sold me a watch,
I got a deal on a watch.

1125
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:18,120
How do I know where it came from?
I gave it to you.

1126
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:20,629
Terry,
is he fighting or you want to call the fight?

1127
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:23,760
What kind of stupid motherfucker pounds
a watch he got from Chet Frank?

1128
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,239
How did you know how the window got broke?
- That isn't important.

1129
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,540
No, no, no.
We were the only ones there.

1130
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:34,579
Leave it, Mike.

1131
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:37,770
A guy killed himself because a window
got broke. How did you know about the window?

1132
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:40,680
Your wife sold you out.

1133
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:46,959
Well, who did you think you married?

1134
01:22:48,490 --> 01:22:51,060
A Brazilian princess married the soldier.

1135
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:53,860
5 years and the soldier is pumping gaps.

1136
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,960
The smart girl is going to move on.

1137
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:58,660
Your fight, or I am calling the fight
and your out.

1138
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:05,600
Either way Mike, sometimes you
got to do business.

1139
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:08,540
Pack it up, I'm going home.

1140
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:49,770
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1141
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:52,579
<i>on the under card there is a substitution.</i>

1142
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:55,680
<i>Our next fight a substitution.</i>

1143
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:59,390
<i>Juan Toro Gracia.</i>

1144
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:02,690
<i>And fighting in place of Mike Terry.</i>

1145
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:06,390
<i>Steve "Moose" Malorin.</i>

1146
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:12,500
<i> Steve "Moose" Malorin will fight
Juan Toro Garcia.</i>

1147
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:19,009
But Jiu-Jitsu can, if all else goes wrong,
give you the ability to turn the fight around.

1148
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:21,840
And turn the fight around is exactly
what we saw here tonight.

1149
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:24,149
Teacher breaks up two boys
fighting in the schoolyard

1150
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:25,819
ask to one boy, do you like to fight?

1151
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,149
He said no, I like to win.

1152
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:30,140
Well. After all, Dillon.
Isn't that what it is all about?

1153
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:32,710
And that's why we're here at the I.F.A tonight.

1154
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:36,820
Are we out?
- Thanks.

1155
01:25:37,221 --> 01:25:39,021
Do you want me to take your microphone?

1156
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:41,030
I'll see you at ringside in five minutes.

1157
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:47,130
Mr. Flint?

1158
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:50,230
Hey, hold on.
- Mr. Flint?

1159
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,140
Mr. Flint?

1160
01:25:52,141 --> 01:25:54,070
Hey, stop him.
Stop him.

1161
01:25:54,071 --> 01:25:56,871
Hey, you quit.
- Mr. Flint?

1162
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:00,070
Mr. Flint, I need to talk to you?

1163
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:04,820
Mr. Flint?

1164
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:07,890
Mike, Mike.
- I need to talk to you.

1165
01:26:07,891 --> 01:26:09,490
Stop him.

1166
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:12,990
Will somebody stop him?
- Mr. Flint, I need to tell you something.

1167
01:26:19,791 --> 01:26:21,991
Will somebody stop him?

1168
01:26:23,392 --> 01:26:25,492
What's wrong with you?
- Mr. Flint?

1169
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:27,809
You want to fight?
Why you don't go to the fucking ring?

1170
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:29,340
Just a moment.

1171
01:26:30,641 --> 01:26:33,541
What do you do?
- Mike, you hear me?

1172
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:36,610
I am going to rip it open.
- Oh, you going to fucking rip it open?

1173
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,320
All right, great.

1174
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:45,229
You think you're going to the ring?
Yeah?

1175
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:48,129
You are going nowhere, Mike.
You are going nowhere.

1176
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:51,229
You see?
You are going nowhere.

1177
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:55,430
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
That's right. That's right.

1178
01:26:55,631 --> 01:26:58,431
Fuck him up.
Fuck him up!

1179
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,220
I'm ending this charade.

1180
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,540
I'm going to the ring.

1181
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:46,250
You're going to the ring,
to do what?

1182
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:47,819
To do what,
to ruin my business?

1183
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:48,629
That's right.

1184
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:51,529
I prefer you didn't do that.
- I understand that.

1185
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:55,959
You know, my sister was wrong.
You were wrong.

1186
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,630
You know what you are?

1187
01:27:57,870 --> 01:28:01,170
You're addicted to poverty.
- I'm going to the ring.

1188
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:07,560
I'm talking to you.
Ok, you want to play?

1189
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,810
Let's do this thing.

1190
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,720
Let's play the game.

1191
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:24,999
A relatively new sport, it's only been
here in this country for 14 years

1192
01:28:25,090 --> 01:28:28,420
a little longer then that in Brazil and Japan.
But still relatively...

1193
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:30,490
after all that is..
- It is in a vault.

1194
01:28:30,891 --> 01:28:33,091
The old meets the new.

1195
01:28:33,191 --> 01:28:35,491
I'm excited about the under card.

1196
01:28:35,492 --> 01:28:38,192
So, these competitors who we don't know yet.

1197
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:41,000
Tomy, Tommy.
Check this out.

1198
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:43,810
We got to see this.

1199
01:28:50,911 --> 01:28:53,011
It's the craziest thing I ever seen.

1200
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:04,090
It's Terry.
- That's Mike!

1201
01:29:06,191 --> 01:29:08,591
It's here.
- Down there.

1202
01:29:10,092 --> 01:29:12,992
Come on, Mike.
- Win it.

1203
01:29:12,993 --> 01:29:14,493
Hang on it, Mike.

1204
01:29:16,894 --> 01:29:18,394
Skills, Mike.

1205
01:34:46,395 --> 01:34:52,495
Vertaling: Thai-Tanic en Kathmandu.
