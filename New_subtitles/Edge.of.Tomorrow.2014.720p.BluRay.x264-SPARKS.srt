1
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,801
<i>Start talking.</i>

2
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,640
<i>I'm not sure if we're on the air.</i>

3
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,689
<i>This is a series of explosions...</i>

4
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,763
<i>We're being told...</i>

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,683
<i>...this is a major incident.</i>

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,763
<i>The emergency is a major incident.</i>

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,695
<i>...bright lights and an orange glow.</i>

8
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,529
<i>That was the moment the meteor hit.</i>

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,880
<i>It does now appear...</i>

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,610
<i>...to be a major attack.</i>

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,840
<i>Since they landed
outside Hamburg five years ago...</i>

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,280
<i>...they have steadily advanced...</i>

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,721
<i>...across Europe.
We've suffered millions of casualties.</i>

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,045
<i>The evacuation of key
government officials continuing.</i>

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,920
<i>Nothing has stopped their advance.</i>

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,401
<i>In human costs,
the Europeans have paid the highest price.</i>

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,683
<i>They have the ability to mimic
and even anticipate our actions.</i>

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,768
<i>If we do not defeat them...</i>

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,762
<i>...in France...</i>

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,161
<i>...we'll be fighting them in London...</i>

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,970
<i>...then New York, then Tokyo.</i>

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,930
<i>All of humanity's at stake.</i>

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,920
<i>After five years...</i>

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,411
<i>...we finally have a victory.</i>

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,840
<i>These pictures are just in...</i>

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,001
<i>...from Verdun.</i>

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,480
<i>One of the striking things
was how low casualties were...</i>

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,090
<i>...and how little damage...</i>

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,360
<i>We have seen a stunning victory here today.</i>

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,687
<i>How do you convince people that this</i> is...

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,445
<i>...a fight that can be won?</i>

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,523
<i>This is an alien invasion
in a global war.</i>

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,161
<i>With the new jacket technology
and limited training...</i>

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,289
<i>...we've been able
to create super-soldiers.</i>

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,362
<i>Look at Rita Vrataski,
the Angel of Verdun.</i>

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,080
<i>They're calling her the Angel of Verdun.</i>

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,561
<i>She is seen as the new hope for this war.</i>

38
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,046
<i>It's extraordinary.</i>

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,487
<i>With the new jacket technology
and limited training...</i>

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,762
<i>...Rita Vrataski was able to kill...</i>

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,809
<i>...hundreds of mimics on only her first day.</i>

42
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,042
<i>Is the tide of this war changing?</i>

43
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,489
<i>The Army attribute this success
to a revolutionary new technology:</i>

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,245
<i>The Exosuit jacket.</i>

45
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,048
<i>She was able to kill hundreds of mimics
on only her first day in combat.</i>

46
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,687
<i>Imagine an army of Rita Vrataskis.</i>

47
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,807
<i>We're holding them...</i>

48
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,646
<i>...back at the English Channel,
but for how long?</i>

49
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,248
<i>This is dangerous talk.
People are suspicious about this invasion.</i>

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,811
<i>Over 17 nations have joined
the United Defense Force...</i>

51
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,570
<i>...which hopes to push them back.</i>

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,211
<i>We've got them contained.</i>

53
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,250
<i>And with this new technology,
we're gonna defeat them.</i>

54
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,246
<i>Operation Downfall is going to be
the largest mechanized invasion in history.</i>

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,007
<i>We will be victorious.
We fight. That's what we do.</i>

56
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,567
Major William Cage,
United States Military Media.

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,131
Welcome to London, major.

58
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,489
The general will see you now.

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,721
Thank you.

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,283
<i>Operation Downfall.</i>

61
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,491
The entire UDF, invading from France,
the Mediterranean, Scandinavia...

62
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,569
...relieving pressure on the eastern front...

63
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,200
...allowing the Russians and Chinese
to push the enemy back.

64
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,765
We all meet in the middle...

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,083
...exterminating this mimic scourge
along the way.

66
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,201
A lot of good soldiers
are gonna die tomorrow, major.

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,845
When all the smoke clears...

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,481
...and the body bags start coming home,
people look for someone to blame...

69
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,370
...someone like me.

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,080
Ideally, I'd prefer a different scenario.

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,403
Please.

72
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,366
A best-selling memoir, perhaps.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,445
Maybe a career in politics?

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,042
Off the top of my head,
I would go with...

75
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,123
...the sense of manifest destiny.

76
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,408
Rags to riches.
Rapid rise through the ranks.

77
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,486
Born to deliver us. And the people,
well, they love that sort of thing.

78
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,287
You misunderstand. I didn't ask you here
to sell me. Sell the invasion.

79
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,962
Okay.

80
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,409
You ship for the coast in one hour.
Your camera crew is standing by.

81
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,603
You'll be on the beach
with the first wave.

82
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,971
I'm sorry, the first wave? The beach?
You mean the front?

83
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,201
France.

84
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,406
Satellites show minimal
enemy movement on the coast.

85
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,971
Little resistance.

86
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,969
A little excitement,
something to tell your grandchildren.

87
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,446
While I appreciate...

88
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,409
...the confidence, general...

89
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,722
...I do this to avoid doing that.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,764
I was in ROTC in college.

91
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,442
The war broke out,
I lost my advertising firm...

92
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,121
...and here I am.

93
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,170
You know, I do what I do,
and you do what you do.

94
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,601
But...

95
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,083
...I'm not a soldier, really.

96
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,361
No, of course you're not.

97
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,246
I'm embedding you with several
hundred thousand who are.

98
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,204
While it is an honor,
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline.

99
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,484
Can't stand the sight of blood.
Not so much as a paper out.

100
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,607
But...

101
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,320
...sitting here thinking about this...

102
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,528
...a couple of names come to mind...

103
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,684
...that I feel I could recommend to you.

104
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,008
It's not an offer, major. It's an order.

105
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,726
General, I am an officer
in the United States military.

106
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,804
- You don't even have the authority.
- I have spoken to your CO.

107
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,691
You are now under my command.

108
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,806
You will retain your present rank...

109
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,644
...of course.

110
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,211
My secretary has all the details.

111
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,650
Do a good job, major.

112
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,247
Good luck. You are dismissed.

113
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,246
General?

114
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,965
I just inspired millions of people
to join your army.

115
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,603
And when the body bags come home
and they're looking...

116
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,322
...for someone to blame,
how hard do you think it would be...

117
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,683
...for me to convince people
to blame you?

118
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,763
I'd imagine...

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,685
...the general would prefer to avoid that.

120
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,965
Are you blackmailing me, major?

121
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,810
I would prefer...

122
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,365
...not to be filming acts of heroism
and valor on that beach tomorrow.

123
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,411
You won't be.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,048
I'm glad we could, work this out.

125
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,009
Now if you'll excuse me, general. I...

126
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,047
Thank you.

127
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,166
Arrest this man.

128
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,288
What?

129
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,000
Hey! Hey!

130
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,690
Stop right there!

131
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,288
Hey! Stop!

132
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,851
Get out of the way!

133
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,803
Out of the way!

134
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,840
Hold it!

135
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,445
Left flank, march!

136
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,245
Forward, march!

137
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,170
About-turn!

138
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,448
<i>Supplies closing in 10 minutes.</i>

139
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,443
On your feet...

140
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,329
...maggot!

141
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,368
That is no way...

142
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,329
...to address an officer, sergeant.

143
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,609
It's how I address a slack-jawed recruit
before I bust his hole...

144
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,285
...with my boot heel, maggot.

145
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,085
Hold up there, sergeant.

146
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,165
Can I help you, sir?

147
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,165
Where the hell am I, sergeant?

148
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,010
Forward Operating Base Heathrow.

149
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,446
You just came in with...

150
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,126
- ...the fresh recruits.
- Do I strike you as a fresh recruit?

151
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,801
No, sir, you do not.

152
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,326
My name is Major William Cage.

153
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,210
- I'm an American officer.
- Officer?

154
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,885
This is processing.

155
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,648
There's no officers here.
I got this, sergeant.

156
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,488
How the hell...

157
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,688
...did you end up in processing?

158
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,523
What was it?
Poker night? Bachelor party?

159
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,643
If it's all the same to you, sergeant...

160
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,730
...I'd like to explain that
to my commanding officer in Washington.

161
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,361
- If you'll take me to a phone...
- Haven't you heard?

162
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,041
We're T-minus-Haul-Ass-H-Hour.

163
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,609
We're fixing to invade France.

164
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,526
This whole FOB's on lockdown.
No calls, in or out.

165
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
- Name is Farell.
- That's right.

166
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,806
Master Sergeant Farell.

167
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,121
You're an American.

168
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,289
No, sir. I'm from Kentucky.

169
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,491
Okay. Well, look at me.

170
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,850
And look at where I am.

171
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,005
I've been railroaded.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,446
It's obvious I don't belong here.

173
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,405
So please, sergeant, there has to be a way
I can make a phone call.

174
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,605
I'll get you sorted out, sir.

175
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,922
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

176
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,615
Where you from in Kentucky?

177
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,760
Little town called Science Hill. Heard of it?

178
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,722
I have now.

179
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,928
- Where you from?
- Cranbury, New Jersey.

180
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,770
They grow a lot of cranberries there?

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,490
Tomatoes. Best you ever had.

182
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,449
Why they call it Cranberry, then?

183
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,091
Why they call it Science Hill?

184
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,084
Never asked. Don't care.

185
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,321
After you.

186
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,929
You're not taking me to a phone, are you?

187
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,525
No, I am not.

188
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,001
Seems about the only honest thing
you said to me so far is your name.

189
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,491
Says here you're a deserter.

190
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,881
It says here you were caught
impersonating an officer.

191
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,803
It says here...

192
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,840
...you'd likely try to make an outside call,
compromise security of this operation.

193
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,606
Anything to get out
of combat duty tomorrow.

194
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,524
But that's not gonna happen.

195
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,206
Even

196
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,930
Private Cage.

197
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,811
<i>Take you down to the early days</i>

198
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,166
<i>When the champagne</i>

199
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,004
<i>Flow like a river stream</i>

200
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,600
Rumor is a terrible thing.

201
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,923
Come nightfall, these men will all reach
the same conclusion.

202
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,164
That you're a coward and a liar,
putting your life above theirs.

203
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,128
Good news is...

204
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,771
...there's hope for you, private.

205
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,571
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

206
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,610
Battle is the great redeemer.

207
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,049
The fiery crucible in which
the only true heroes are forged.

208
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,926
The one place where all men
truly share the same rank...

209
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,761
...regardless of what kind
of parasitic scum they were going in.

210
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,964
Squad! This here...

211
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,651
...is Private Cage.

212
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,121
Private Cage, J Squad.

213
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,640
Isn't that an officer's uniform?

214
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,241
Those sure ain't officer cufflinks.

215
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,280
I see everyone...

216
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,204
...is having a productive morning.

217
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,761
You know, it gives me a swell of pride...

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,445
...knowing soldiers of your...

219
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,326
...caliber will be leading
the charge tomorrow.

220
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,204
Tip of the spear.

221
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,244
Edge of the knife.

222
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,407
Crack of my...

223
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,801
...ass.

224
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,371
Shit.

225
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,921
Private Kimmel,
what is my view of gambling...

226
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,969
- ...in the barracks?
- You dislike it.

227
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,480
Nance, why do I dislike it?

228
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,803
It entertains the notion our fate
is in hands other than our own.

229
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,122
And what is my definitive
position on the concept...

230
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,725
...of fate, chorus?

231
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,482
Through readiness and discipline,
we are masters of our fate.

232
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
You might call...

233
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,970
...that notion ironic.

234
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,250
But trust me, you'll come around.

235
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,284
Private Cage is a deserter.

236
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,081
I'm making you all...

237
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,440
...personally responsible...

238
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,607
...for his deliverance.

239
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,880
He will be combat ready...

240
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,087
...at 0600 tomorrow.

241
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,082
Combat ready?

242
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,004
Cage is under the delusion
he does not belong here.

243
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,846
We must dissuade him of this delusion.

244
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,721
If he tries to run, feel free to dissuade him
until he can't piss standing up.

245
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,041
You have to listen to me.

246
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,721
- I will never be combat ready.
- I envy you, Cage.

247
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,081
Tomorrow morning,
you will be baptized. Born again.

248
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,722
PT! Ten minutes!

249
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,482
<i>So everybody</i>

250
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,563
<i>Come along with me</i>

251
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,002
<i>Go down the river
And wash your feet</i>

252
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,242
<i>To where the people
Live a life that's sweet</i>

253
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,811
<i>And a place that's ripe</i>

254
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,849
You're not in uniform...

255
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,686
...private.

256
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,808
<i>Could all combat-ready squadrons proceed...?</i>

257
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,565
It's a new day, people.

258
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,165
Destiny calls.

259
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,808
The world expects only one thing from us: That we will win.

260
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,530
Come on, Kimmel, let's have it!

261
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,564
For chrissake, Kimmel.

262
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,768
I got to be free, man.

263
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,761
Let's get this show on the road.
I gotta suit up.

264
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,605
What's that noise? That...

265
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,847
Let's go.

266
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,128
Listen, I've never been in one of these.

267
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,328
I've never been with two girls
at the same time.

268
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,927
You can bet when that day comes,
I'll make it work.

269
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,803
Kimmel.

270
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,321
It's Griff.

271
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,726
Griff. Griff. You bet.

272
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,931
Just think about this, man.
I could hurt somebody with it.

273
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,525
Not with the safety on, you won't.

274
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,041
But...

275
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,326
- Where is the safety?
- Exactly.

276
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,080
It's time.

277
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,926
Bloody hell, it's the Full Metal...

278
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,246
Move.

279
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,001
- Griff.
- Sarge?

280
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,965
- Take care of Private Cage.
- What, all day?

281
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,447
Something tells me
it won't be nearly that long.

282
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,003
- Cage!

283
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,287
- Cage!
- Cage!

284
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,451
We lost Germany.

285
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,091
We lost France.

286
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,247
If we lose today...

287
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,644
...we won't get to fight another.

288
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,881
I know...

289
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,930
...the pressure on you is enormous.

290
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,884
Two minutes to drop.

291
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,730
It's all right to be scared.

292
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,606
Remember,
there's no courage without fear.

293
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,007
Oi!

294
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,247
Oi, mate! I think there's
something wrong with your suit.

295
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,926
Yeah. There's a dead guy in it.

296
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,851
Hey, watch your back out there, sir.

297
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,680
No one else will.

298
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,082
One minute!

299
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,049
One minute to drop!

300
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,246
Hey.

301
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,603
- Hey!
- What?

302
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,967
How do I turn the safety
off of my weapon?

303
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,968
What?

304
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,409
How do I turn the safety off...?

305
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,641
My God!

306
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,129
Get ready! Thirty seconds...

307
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,805
...to drop!

308
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,004
On my mark!

309
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,845
Stand by to deploy!

310
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,969
Activate drop lines. Remember...

311
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,170
Aah! Aah!

312
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,162
Drop now!

313
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,441
Let's drop! Drop!

314
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,602
Drop!

315
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,243
Drop!

316
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,442
Go!

317
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,886
Go, let's go!

318
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,049
Come on!

319
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,249
Drop!

320
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,083
Drop!

321
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,645
Cage! Drop or die!

322
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,209
Yeah! Whoo!

323
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,169
We made it!

324
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,481
Thank God, we made it!

325
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,327

Private Cage!

330
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,365
You're going the wrong way.

331
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,443
You're gonna miss your moment.

332
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,246
What the hell?

333
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,769
They're not supposed to know
we're coming.

334
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,969
We walked into a slaughterhouse, man.

335
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,120
It's a slaughterhouse!

336
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,481
Pull yourself together!

337
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,370
On your feet, people!

338
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,486
Get in line!

339
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,210
Nance, get me a sitrep.

340
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,011
- Safety! My safety!
- Griff, Ford, cover the flank!

341
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,848
My safety. My safety.
How do I get my safety...?

342
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,440
- I'm waiting, Nance!
- I got traces!

343
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,688
Five hundred meters
and they're coming in fast!

344
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,206
Son of a bitch.

345
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,487
Out of the way!

00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,408

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,968
...maggot!

361
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,845
Get in line before I bust your hole...

362
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,920
...with my boot heel!

363
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,684
Hold up there, sergeant.

364
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,770
Can I help you, sir?

365
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,450
Sergeant Farell. Is it...?

366
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,570
That is my name.

367
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,731
I think I get it.

368
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,127
What was it?
Poker night? Bachelor party?

369
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,161
You know, I'm not sure.

370
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,802
It happens.

371
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,200
I'll get you sorted out, sir.

372
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,002
Let me take those...

373
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,162
...for you.

374
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,890
What day is it?

375
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,006
For you?

376
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,124
Judgment Day.

377
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,207
The good news is
there's hope for you, private.

378
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,721
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

379
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,564
Battle is the great redeemer.

380
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,525
The fiery crucible in which...

381
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,935
...the only true heroes are...
- The only true heroes...

382
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,961
...are forged.

383
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,048
Did you just interrupt me, private?

384
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,961
Sarge, you're...

385
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,245
You're not gonna believe
what I'm about to tell you.

386
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,447
No, I'm not.

387
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,404
Now, where was I?

388
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,127
The fiery crucible.

389
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,520
The fiery crucible...

390
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,286
...in which the only
true heroes are forged.

391
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,244
<i>The one place where all men truly share...</i>

392
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,445
...the same rank, regardless of what kind
of parasitic scum they were going in.

393
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,841
- Welcome to hell.
- Squad!

394
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,686
This here is Private Cage.

395
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,680
Private Cage...

396
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,524
...J Squad.

397
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,046
Isn't that an officer's uniform?

398
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,123
They sure ain't officer cufflinks.

399
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,335
You know, it gives me a swell of pride...

400
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,681
...knowing soldiers of your caliber...

401
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,803
...will be leading the charge tomorrow.

402
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,407
Tip of the spear, edge of the knife.

403
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,963
Crack of my ass.

404
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,802
Private Kimmel, what is my view
of gambling in the barracks?

405
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,600
- Dislike it, sergeant.
- Nance, why do I dislike it?

406
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,610
It entertains the notion our fate
is in hands other than our own.

407
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,935
And what is my definitive position...

408
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,531
...on the concept of fate, chorus?

409
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,764
Through readiness and discipline,
we are masters of our fate.

410
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,482
You might call that notion ironic.

411
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,326
Trust me, you'll come around.

412
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,483
For chrissake, Kimmel.

413
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,121
- I gotta be free, man.
- All right, man.

414
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,280
Let's get this show on the road.
I gotta suit up.

415
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,167
<i>Disengaged.</i>

416
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,324
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?

417
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,324
Haven't you ever been
in one of these before?

418
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,371
Maybe.

419
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,560
Know where the safety is?

420
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,280
- I'm not sure.
- Good.

421
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,446
I know the pressure on you is enormous.

422
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,889
Two minutes to drop.

423
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,645
It's all right to be scared.

424
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,802
There's no courage...

425
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,565
...without fear.

426
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,126
Oi!

427
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,521
Oi, mate!

428
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,600
I think there's something wrong
with your suit.

429
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,011
Yeah. There's a dead guy in it.

430
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,686
Watch your back out there...

431
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,460
...sir.

432
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,480
- No one else will.
- No one else will.

433
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,768
Ha-ha! Jinx, bitch!

434
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,051
On my mark! Stand by to deploy!

435
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,647
Activate drop lines, 30 seconds.

436
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,961
- Remember, hit...
- Hey!

437
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,767
Go! Go!

438
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,041
Whoo-hoo!

439
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,281
We made it!

440
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,686
Behind you!

441
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,601
Look out!

442
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,402
Incoming!

443
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,282
I'm hit.

444
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,060
I'm hit.

445
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,927
How bad is it?

446
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,126
Is there a lot of blood?

447
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,522
You have a hole in your chest.

448
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,288
Really?

449
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,521
Yeah.

450
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,564
Did you just take my...?

451
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,361
My battery?

452
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,088
No, no, no. Holy fu...

453
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,526
Aah!

454
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,243
On your feet...

455
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,169
...maggot!

456
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,765
Sergeant Farell!

457
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,604
Sergeant Farell.

458
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,960
Can I help you, sir?

459
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,845
My name is Major Bill Cage.
I'm U.S. Army Media Relations.

460
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,570
I was not at a bachelor party
or a poker game.

461
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,000
You have an order that says...

462
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,242
...I'm a deserter caught
impersonating an officer.

463
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,891
But what it doesn't say is...

464
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,855
...your name is Master Sergeant Farell
from Science Hill, Kentucky.

465
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,245
If you give me 30 seconds...

466
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,289
...to explain how I know that,
you may save the lives...

467
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,966
...of every soldier on this base.

468
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,482
You have to listen to me! They know
we're coming! They're waiting for us!

469
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,166
I have been there! I've seen it!

470
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,607
You're all doomed! You're doomed!

471
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,680
Okay. Okay. Okay, I'm fine. I'm fine.

472
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,206
This is J Squad. Yes?

473
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,726
This is J Squad, yes.

474
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,962
Not that I should know that, but okay.

475
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,248
Have any of you met me before?

476
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,601
Bitch, I don't know you.

477
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,490
Exactly! Yes!

478
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,528
Thank you.

479
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,886
Your name is Nance. You're Bibble.

480
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,363
Kibble... Kimmell
You fight balls out. Literally.

481
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,441
Ford. Skinner. Griff.

482
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,727
You're...

483
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,691
He doesn't talk much.

484
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,001
But there's a card game...

485
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,730
...under the bed.
- Thanks a lot.

486
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,120
Kimmel's working on a flush.

487
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,128
Spades... No, clubs.

488
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,089
You're gonna make them eat those cards.

489
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,810
Am I right?

490
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,361
Now...

491
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,402
...what I'm about to tell you sounds crazy.

492
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,401
It's true.

493
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,842
And you have to listen to me.

494
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,561
Your very lives depend on it.

495
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,561
One minute!

496
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,240
What? What is he...

497
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,290
...saying?
Nance! What is he saying?

498
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,726
On my mark! Stand by to deploy!

499
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,609
The ship is about to explode!

500
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,325
Yeah! Whoo!

501
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,210
We made it!

502
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,320
Thank God, we made it!

503
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,849
Aah!

504
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,320
...before I bust your hole with my boot heel!

505
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,286
Yeah! Whoo!

506
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,204
We made it!

507
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,320
Thank God, we made it!

508
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,848
Aah!

509
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,286
I'm sorry. I'm trying to save you.

510
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,487
We're getting...

511
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,680
...slaughtered.
You need to get us off this beach.

512
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,730
We have to go. This drop ship...

513
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,411
...is about to explode.

514
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,846
We have to go now.

515
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,567
Wait.

516
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,242
Come on!

517
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,887
Come on!

518
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,721
Come on!

519
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,371
This ship is going to explode!

520
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,882
What are you doing?

521
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,125
Find me when you wake up.

522
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,729
What?

523
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,200
Come find me when you wake up.

524
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,320
Aah!

525
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,609
On your feet...

526
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,881
...maggot!

527
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,567
Get in line before I bust your hole
with my boot heel!

528
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,888
Good news is there's hope for you, private.

529
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,326
Battle is the great redeemer.

530
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,410
The fiery crucible in which
the only true heroes are forged.

531
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,921
The one place where all men truly sh...

532
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,721
Squad, this here is...

533
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,088
Private Cage.
And you must be J Squad.

534
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,641
It's good to meet you.

535
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,405
Isn't that an officer's uniform?

536
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,085
- Those sure...
- These sure ain't officer's...

537
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,731
...cufflinks.

538
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,690
Keys in the...

539
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,008
...left pocket, probably.

540
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,568
Private Cage is a deserter.

541
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,322
I'm making you all personally
responsible for his deliverance.

542
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,207
He will be combat ready
by 0600 tomorrow.

543
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,046
Private Cage is under the delusion
he does not belong here.

544
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,930
We must dissuade him of this delusion.

545
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,687
- If he tries to run, feel free to dissuade him...
- No. I'm not gonna run.

546
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,643
- Not a chance.
- Till he can't piss standing up.

547
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,450
Thank you, Sergeant Farell.

548
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,445
What next? A little, PT?

549
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,444
PT! Ten minutes!

550
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,966
Left! Left! Left!

551
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,851
- What are you? Sound off!
- I'm a warrior!

552
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,440
- What do warriors do?
- Kill!

553
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,162
- What are you gonna do?
- Kill!

554
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,765
- What are you gonna do?
- Kill!

555
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,968
It's gonna be my 20th battle tomorrow.

556
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,567
- You haven't been in 20 battles, mate.
- I have too.

557
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,531
You're gonna dump your load
the second we hit the beach.

558
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,161
Why don't you get yourselves a cup
of shut-the-hell-up?

559
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,771
Ha-ha. You funny, girl.

560
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,490
I bet I set a record tomorrow.

561
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,247
Fastest time running backwards, Ford,
slipping in your own shit.

562
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,009
Knock off the grab-ass!

563
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,687
Grab this, sarge!

564
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,961
Hold up!

565
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,681
Private, drop...

566
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,961
...and give me...

567
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,841
Fifty, Sarge?

568
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,691
That's right.

569
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,046
Fifty.

570
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,408
Platoon!

571
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,322
Drop and give me 50!

572
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,089
Compliments of Private Cage.

573
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,890
Thank you, Sarge.

574
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,164
- And one!
- One!

575
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,441
- And two!
- Two!

576
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,840
- And three!
- Three!

577
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,569
Aah!

578
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,367
What the hell were you thinking?

579
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,002
There's hope for you, private.
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

580
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,288
Battle is the great redeemer.

581
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,525
- Three!
- Three!

582
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,171
- Four!
- Four!

583
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,925
- Five!
- Five!

584
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,486
Excuse me. Sergeant Vrataski.

585
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,408
Excuse me.

586
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,725
Sergeant Vrataski?

587
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,322
Excuse me.

588
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,971
Yes? Who said you could talk to me?

589
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,644
Have I got something on my face?

590
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,524
You did. You did.

591
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,564
Tomorrow. At the beach.

592
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,604
Tomorrow. At the beach.

593
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,962
We meet.

594
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,571
You said to find you when I wake up.

595
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,927
You do know what's happening to me.

596
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,491
Come with me.

597
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,440
Now.

598
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,411
You don't talk to anyone
about this but me.

599
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,530
The best-case scenario is
you're gonna end up in a psych ward.

600
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,046
Worst case, you'll get...

601
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,970
...dissected for study. Are we clear?

602
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,446
- Yes?
- Yes.

603
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,364
First time you died, what happened?

604
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,886
- You killed a mimic?
- Yes.

605
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,640
- Describe it.
- It was different.

606
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,611
It was bigger. Bluish.

607
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,882
And you got covered in its blood.

608
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,563
As a matter of fact, I did.

609
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,366
They know we're coming
on the beach tomorrow.

610
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,443
It's a slaughter, isn't it?

611
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,328
How do you know this?

612
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,371
Could you just...? Wait!

613
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,324
Wait. Wait.

614
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,691
Would you explain to me
what the hell is happening.

615
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,447
What happened to you
happened to me.

616
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,842
I had it. I lost it. Okay?

617
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,606
That's great. There's a cure.
How do I get rid of this?

618
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,251
First, I need your help.

619
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,801
Help with what exactly?

620
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,165
Winning the war.

621
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,160
Let's go! Come on!

622
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,240
Rita, what is this?

623
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,926
What are you doing here?
You gotta give me some warning.

624
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,249
- Who's this?
- He's me. Before Verdun.

625
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,925
He's gonna help us.

626
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,883
What? You mean he's...?

627
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,121
Yes.

628
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,727
When did he die? Where?

629
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,927
On the beach. Tomorrow.

630
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,480
How many fingers am I holding up
behind my back?

631
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,291
How should I know that?

632
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,483
Okay.

633
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,486
So this is the first time
we've had this conversation.

634
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,927
- You should try this on him.
- What is that?

635
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,491
It doesn't work.

636
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,920
Has he had any visions yet?

637
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,042
Visions of what?

638
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,287
There's still time.

639
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,249
- Yes.
- Time? Look, I'm sorry.

640
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,164
Who is this? Who are you?

641
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,289
I'm Dr. Carter. Particle physics.
Advanced microbiology.

642
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,408
He's also the only other person
who'll believe what's happening to you.

643
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,642
No one understands mimic biology
better than him.

644
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,445
He's a top analyst at Whitehall.

645
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,849
Well, I mean, I was until I met Rita
and now I'm just...

646
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,208
...a "mechanic with psychiatric delusions."

647
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,362
Carter.

648
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,801
Show him.

649
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,806
Yeah, right.

650
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,490
Right. Well, first of all...

651
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,975
...you're not fighting an army.

652
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,402
You have to think of this
as a single organism.

653
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,923
Now, these common drones,
they act like...

654
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,769
...its claws.

655
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,806
And Alphas, like the one that you killed,
are much more rare.

656
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,241
Yeah. They're like one in...

657
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,960
- ...6.18 million, by my guess.
- Yes.

658
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,605
They act as the enemy's...

659
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,480
They're like its central nervous system.

660
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,210
But this...

661
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,090
...is the brain.

662
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,529
It controls them all.
And this is the Omega.

663
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,366
And the Omega has the ability
to control time.

664
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,562
Whenever an Alpha is killed...

665
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,246
...an automatic response is triggered.

666
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,046
The Omega starts the day over again.

667
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,608
But you see, this time,
it can remember what's going to happen...

668
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,285
...just like you do.

669
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,601
It knows exactly...

670
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,735
...what we're gonna do
before we're gonna do it.

671
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,411
- And an enemy that knows the future can't lose.
- It can't lose.

672
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,169
But if that's true,
how did you win at Verdun?

673
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,323
We were allowed to win.

674
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,370
This thing wants us to believe
we can win.

675
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,683
It wants us to throw everything we have
into the invasion.

676
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,810
Operation Downfall isn't our endgame...

677
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,690
...it's the enemy's.

678
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,570
The thing you've got to understand is...

679
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,167
...this is a perfectly evolved...

680
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,687
...world-conquering organism.

681
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,445
For all we know,
there are millions of those asteroids...

682
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,080
...floating around in the cosmos...

683
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,406
...like a virus.

684
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,562
They're just waiting...

685
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,371
...to crash-land into a world
with just the right conditions.

686
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,002
All they need is for the dominant life form
to attack and:

687
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,695
There'll be nothing to stop the mimics...

688
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,643
...from conquering the rest of the world.

689
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,162
Unless you change the outcome.

690
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,766
Me?

691
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,691
When you killed that Alpha, you inadvertently
entered the enemy's nervous system.

692
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,928
Cage, you've seized control...

693
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,686
...of the Omega's ability to reset the day.

694
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,487
- How's that even possible?
- Perhaps this organism's...

695
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,650
...only vulnerability,
its only vulnerability...

696
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,881
...is humanity.

697
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,727
Regardless of that,
you control the power now.

698
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,883
Just as I did in Verdun.

699
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,920
So I'm resetting the day?

700
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,886
Okay.

701
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,801
How do I control it?

702
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,730
You have to die.

703
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,760
Every day.

704
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,042
Until the Omega's destroyed.

705
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,245
First of all...

706
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,403
...this is a terrific presentation.

707
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,205
Terrific.

708
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,725
I know the general.

709
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,689
We should take this to him.

710
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,808
- You just tell him everything you told me.
- I went to see the general.

711
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,483
Any number of times.

712
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,284
Psych ward. Dissection. Remember?

713
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,846
What are you expecting from me?

714
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,404
Have you seen anything strange?

715
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,961
Is he shitting me?

716
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,042
Visions.

717
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,487
Visions.
Have you seen any visions like that?

718
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,009
The Omega senses
when it's losing control...

719
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,084
...of its power.
Even now it's mentally searching to find you.

720
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,004
When it's close to finding you...

721
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,210
...you will start having visions.
You'll start to see that.

722
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,687
You'll even see where it is.

723
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,726
And you had these visions?

724
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,406
Yes.

725
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,443
But eventually you saw it.
I mean, you actually saw it.

726
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,806
Right?

727
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,447
Never in the flesh.

728
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,442
So this is all just some...

729
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,680
...theory.

730
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,931
You don't know if this thing even exists.

731
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,721
The visions showed me it was at Verdun.
I could see it. I...

732
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,926
I just...

733
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,561
...lost the power before I could get to it.

734
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,960
And by the time we took...

735
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,161
...Verdun...

736
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,362
...the Omega was gone.

737
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,008
Okay. So all I have to do is...

738
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,203
...wait to have these visions...

739
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,967
...and then tell you
where this Omega thing is.

740
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,765
No. Cage.

741
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,368
You're gonna get me there.

742
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,126
And I'm gonna kill it.

743
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,686
Get you there?

744
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,842
I'm not even trained for combat.

745
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,640
<i>Reload.</i>

746
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,845
<i>Reload.</i>

747
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,365
Are you all right, Cage?

748
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,605
I think I broke something.

749
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,086
What?

750
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,121
My back.

751
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,766
The only thing I can feel are my lips.

752
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,767
Now listen carefully.
This is a very important rule.

753
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,963
This is the only rule.

754
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,124
You get injured on the field,
you better make sure you die.

755
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:24,882
Why?

756
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,963
Last time I was in combat...

757
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,366
...I was hit.

758
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,810
I was bleeding out.
Just not fast enough.

759
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,800
I woke up in a field hospital...

760
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,482
...with three pints of someone else's blood
and I was out.

761
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,689
I lost the power. Do you understand?

762
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,480
Think we better start over.

763
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,687
- Don't you?
- What?

764
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,161
Aah!

765
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,360
No one knows
what happened to Private Cage!

766
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,570
You dumb-ass. He was right next to you.

767
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,286
You don't know
where that slippery son of a bitch went?

768
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,891
No, Sarge!

769
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,610
All right.

770
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,888
Let's do another 50, shall we?

771
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,007
And one!

772
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,449
No, wait! Wait. My name is Bill Cage.

773
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,923
I.. We met on the beach.
We meet on the beach. Tomorrow.

774
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,286
I have what you had.

775
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,482
All right, let's go again.

776
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,487
You don't have time to think. Remember.

777
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,680
It's not enough knowing
where they're going to be.

778
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,121
You have to know how to kill them.

779
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,362
Hold on. Hold on. Listen. List...

780
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,361
Okay. Do it.

781
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,727
Unh!

782
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,320
On your feet, maggot!

783
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,883
Stop! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

784
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,804
Stop! Wait! Wait a second!

785
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,566
Wait a Sec. Wait a second.

786
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,204
You know, I've been thinking.

787
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,171
I mean, this thing's in my blood.

788
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,286
So maybe there's some way...

789
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,803
...I can transfer it to you.

790
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,082
I've tried everything. It doesn't work.

791
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,890
I mean, have you...

792
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,681
...you know...

793
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,487
...tried all the options?

794
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,122
You mean sex. Yep. Tried it.

795
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,202
How many times?

796
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,248
All right.

797
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,329
Left.

798
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,280
Left! Left, left!

799
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,641
Keep your eyes open.

800
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:33,563
Again.

801
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,100
Again.

802
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,523
Again.

803
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,522
Again.

804
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,606
Just wait! Wait.

805
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,881
I think I'm okay.

806
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,246
Unh!

807
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:52,843
On your feet!

808
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,207
Maggot! Maggot!

809
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,922
I'm trying to be nice to you, maggot! Move!

810
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,761
You okay, Cage?

811
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,604
Yeah, yeah! I'm good! I'm good!

812
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,841
Your leg's broken.

813
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,321
No. I can still feel my toes.

814
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,920
Come on.

815
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,365
Aah!

816
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,290
Rita. Rita. What is this?
What are you doing here?

817
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,329
- Who's this guy?
- He's me...

818
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,960
- ...before Verdun.
- Before Verdun.

819
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,321
What do you mean? He's...?

820
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,766
- Yes. Yes.
- When did he die?

821
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,650
- Where?
- On the beach. Tomorrow.

822
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,215
I'm Bill Cage. You're Dr. Carter.

823
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,800
We've had this conversation before.
Two fingers behind your back.

824
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,524
I've had the visions.

825
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,886
I've seen the Omega.

826
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,208
Um...

827
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,526
It's pretty much game over tomorrow.

828
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,966
So can we move this along?

829
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,129
Okay. Where?

830
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,004
There's a dam.

831
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,040
It's in the mountains. I saw German writing.

832
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,255
Do you think you can work out
where that is?

833
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,725
I mean, there can't be...

834
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,720
...too many places that fit that description.
I'll see what I can do.

835
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,444
Training's over. I'll see you tomorrow.

836
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,215
We don't even know where we're going.

837
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,571
We will soon enough.

838
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,162
In the meantime, you need to figure out
a way to get us off that beach.

839
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,323
What next? Where are we going?

840
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,891
Which way? Focus. Which way?

841
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,207
- I'm thinking.
- Okay.

842
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,961
Man!

843
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,920
How far did we make it?

844
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,089
You know, it's hard to say, really.

845
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,409
Hold! Hold!

846
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,326
Okay, go!

847
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,202
Son of a bitch!

848
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,011
I thought stepping left, ducking...
Just for the record.

849
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,607
- It was pretty specific.
- Stepping left, ducking right.

850
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,889
Stepping left, ducking right. Move on.

851
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,325
Hold on! Now, remember:

852
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,245
Across the trench, 12:00!

853
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,641
Then look to your right!

854
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,646
You're not being specific.

855
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,082
You need to be specific. Otherwise, I'm dead.

856
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,405
Rita.

857
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,201
Cage!

858
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,971
...Paces up to the top of the trench.
I'm gonna step left.

859
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,725
A mimic there, which I'll kill.

860
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,966
...Ship explosion.
I'm gonna run 30 paces northwest.

861
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,602
I'm gonna duck at the top of that trench
and then I'm gonna turn left.

862
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,250
Have I got something on my face?

863
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,361
No.

864
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,801
Cage!

865
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,883
We've been looking everywhere for you.

866
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,681
Cage!

867
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,362
- Cage, we've been looking...
- Guys.

868
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,491
Guys. Can we...

869
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,846
...just...

870
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,161
...not do this today?

871
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,330
What are you talking about?

872
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,562
Farell almost strung us up
by our bollocks for losing track...

873
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,608
...of you.

874
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,690
Okay, Skinner. Watch this.

875
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,204
Now I'm gonna close my eyes.

876
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,805
- Ready?
- Yeah.

877
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,011
Sneaky...

878
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,241
...bastard.

879
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,369
I didn't mind the extra push-ups.

880
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,081
It's a new day...

881
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,560
...people.

882
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,491
Destiny calls.

883
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,122
The world expects only one thing from us: that we will win.

884
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,095
<i>- Current situation on the front line.</i>

885
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,327
<i>Our troops have suffered heavy casualties.</i>

886
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,120
It's about time we showed
those things what we're made of.

887
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,567
My father flew in the Battle of Britain.

888
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,810
Three years before the Yanks
came into the war.

889
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,644
Couldn't be broken.

890
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,881
Backbone.

891
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,280
My Uncle George landed
on the beach at Normandy.

892
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,441
Yeah?

893
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,371
In their day,
this war would have been over by now.

894
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,324
What do they want with us, anyway?

895
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,409
It's obvious, isn't it? Minerals.

896
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,210
- Minerals?
- Yeah, minerals. Metals.

897
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,686
- Oxygen, they want.
- Oxygen?

898
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,120
- Think about it.
- What difference does it make?

899
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,368
They're here. They're winning.

900
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,046
And whatever it is, they're gonna get it.

901
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,360
Shouldn't you be...

902
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,441
...over there?

903
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,367
I've been over there.

904
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,122
More times...

905
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,486
...than anybody.

906
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,725
As a matter of fact,
I'm usually long dead by now.

907
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,481
Coward.

908
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,961
What's going on?

909
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,440
The power's gone.

910
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,926
I found the Omega.

911
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,970
I found it. It has to be here.
Curnera Dam, Germany.

912
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,170
- This has got to be it. It fits the description.
- You found it.

913
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,925
Again.

914
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,650
What difference does it make?

915
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,930
Because we're never gonna get there.

916
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,321
No matter what we do...

917
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,846
...no matter how carefully we plan...

918
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,722
...we can't get off that beach.

919
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,566
You can do this. You can.

920
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,168
You keep coming here every day
and I'll train you.

921
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,445
You already have.

922
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,402
- I'm waiting, Nance!
- Five hundred meters and closing fast!

923
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,371
What the...?

924
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,927
<i>Reload.</i>

925
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,411
What's next?

926
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,560
Straight shot up the hill.

927
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,246
Okay.

928
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,721
Hey, sarge, the new guy...

929
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,405
...what's his name again?

930
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,283
We'll need a vehicle to get further inland.

931
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,766
What's the problem?

932
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,322
The ambush waiting for us.
They kill us before we find a working car.

933
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,244
Okay. So, what's the current plan?

934
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,120
Two cars we haven't tried yet.

935
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,284
- The minivan and the green SUV.
- Yeah. Okay.

936
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,444
I'll head for the SUV, draw the mimics to me.
You go for the minivan.

937
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,524
You get it started, just go, take off.
Do not wait for me.

938
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,886
Okay.

939
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,885
Just don't forget to disconnect the caravan...

940
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,043
...before you take off.
You are going to be...

941
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,931
...in a hurry, you don't want any dead weight.

942
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,881
Come on.

943
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,881
Come on, Cage!

944
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,843
<i>- Casualties. The enemy has breached...</i>

945
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,286
<i>...security at Dover.</i>

946
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,607
Can't see.

947
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,041
Can you?

948
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,001
<i>Stay where you are and remain calm.</i>

949
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,320
<i>If you are in a vehicle...</i>

950
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,124
<i>...please lock doors...</i>

951
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,600
<i>...and stay inside.</i>

952
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,046
<i>I'm sorry. The enemy has reached London.</i>

953
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,611
<i>Repeat:</i>

954
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,245
<i>London is under attack.</i>

955
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,761
Good driving.

956
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,286
I forgot to unhook the trailer.

957
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,642
<i>Engage.</i>

958
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,529
You don't talk much.

959
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,885
I'm not a fan.

960
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,451
Of talking?

961
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,648
Not a fan of talking. No.

962
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,407
You know you eventually do talk to me.

963
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,200
It's usually around Lyons.

964
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,165
You tell me about the time
you went there with your family.

965
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,084
Your brother got lost.

966
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,923
I've never been to Lyons.

967
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,124
You tell me your middle name.

968
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,960
Peyton.

969
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,123
That's not my middle name.

970
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,486
You find your brother
in the arcade, by the way.

971
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,807
Well, maybe I made it all up
just to keep you quiet.

972
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,160
But you do talk to me.

973
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,328
Cage, I do not need to get to know you.

974
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,723
If you knew what was good for you,
you wouldn't want to get to know me.

975
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,201
It's the only way
you make it through this thing.

976
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,162
What about Hendricks?
You get to know him?

977
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,611
- How do you know that name?
- You mentioned him.

978
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,841
That's not possible.

979
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,406
Then how do I know his name?

980
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,120
When did I mention him?
Under what circumstance?

981
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,443
Is he why you won't talk to me?

982
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,561
Don't ever mention his name again.

983
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,001
Why? Are you...

984
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,765
...in love with him?
- He's dead.

985
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,923
And I watched him die 300 times...

986
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,811
...and I remember every detail.

987
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:44,123
I remember everything.
So I don't need to talk about it.

988
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,640
I'm sorry.

989
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,530
It's just war.

990
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,602
There's nothing here. Let's keep going.

991
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,401
We have to find the keys.

992
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,211
Let's just siphon the gas.

993
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,330
- Why drive when we can fly?
- In that thing?

994
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,011
- Let me guess. You're afraid of heights.
- I'm afraid...

995
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,481
...of crashing.
And not at all ashamed to admit it.

996
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,161
You'll be fine, Cage. You'll learn.

997
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,801
What is it?

998
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,326
It's nothing. I'm fine.

999
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,445
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

1000
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,681
Rita.

1001
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,086
Let me see.

1002
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,162
We have to find the keys to the helicopter.

1003
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,687
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

1004
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,925
You know, the heli's full of fuel, though.
I found a hose.

1005
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,003
We're flying, Cage.

1006
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,841
Let's just say we find...

1007
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,082
...the keys. You know?

1008
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,362
Get that helicopter started.

1009
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,200
We don't have our jackets or ammunition.

1010
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,684
It's gonna be dark in a few hours.

1011
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,489
Might be better off just going back
to the farmhouse.

1012
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,245
Seeing what we could salvage.

1013
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,563
Spend the night there.
Come back here in the morning.

1014
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,326
And curl up by the fire
and open a bottle of wine.

1015
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,445
I think we should just reset.

1016
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,289
Whoa!

1017
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,124
It's a dead end.
If it's all the same to you...

1018
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,930
...I'm tired. I'm in pain.

1019
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,764
- I'd rather just start fresh.
- Tell you what.

1020
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,401
Take a few minutes. Coffee's ready.

1021
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,360
I'll look for the keys. That's productive.

1022
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,130
- Ten minutes.
- Okay.

1023
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,481
Then I'm killing you.

1024
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,601
Fine.

1025
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,320
I can't believe you found coffee.

1026
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,201
Thank you.

1027
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,481
Sugar, right?

1028
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,281
Yeah.

1029
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,651
- Thank you.
- No, hold on. Three. You like three.

1030
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,246
There's a shirt over there.
It should be your size.

1031
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,887
How many times have we been here?

1032
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,047
How many times?

1033
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,691
Where are the keys?

1034
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,200
- Where are the goddamn keys?
- Okay.

1035
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,206
You can fly it, can't you?

1036
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,771
No. Well, yes.

1037
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,480
I mean, I can take off.
I'm still working on my landing.

1038
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,569
What are we still doing here?

1039
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,360
- You're wasting time!
- Rita, if you start that engine, you die.

1040
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,129
This is as far as you go.

1041
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,765
No matter what I do...

1042
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,082
...this is as far as you ever make it.

1043
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,202
There's a mimic buried 20 yards away.

1044
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,169
It attacks when you start the engine.

1045
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,126
Get your weapon
and get in the helicopter, Cage.

1046
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,488
There's more in the field back there.

1047
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,005
Only one of us ever makes it.

1048
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,321
Get in.

1049
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,160
Only thing we haven't tried is you walk away.
Go to the farmhouse.

1050
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,406
There's a cellar, food.

1051
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,203
Wait there...

1052
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,363
...till I get back. You'll be safe.

1053
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,849
I'm a soldier. I volunteered.
I'm not walking away.

1054
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,481
You die here. Right here.

1055
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,242
I can't save you.

1056
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,848
And if I go on and kill the Omega,
you're dead.

1057
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,127
Forever.

1058
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,806
Why does it matter what happens to me?

1059
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,441
I wish...

1060
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,691
...I didn't know you.

1061
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,291
But I do.

1062
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,129
My middle name...

1063
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,890
...is Rose.

1064
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,330
On your feet, maggot!

1065
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,895
<i>The good news is there's hope for you, private.</i>

1066
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,844
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

1067
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,570
Battle is the great redeemer.

1068
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,247
The fiery crucible in which
the only true heroes are forged.

1069
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,761
Yes?

1070
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,883
Who said you could talk to me?

1071
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,687
Have I got something on my face, soldier?

1072
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,009
I'm sorry to disturb you, sergeant.

1073
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,482
Let's get this show on the road.
I gotta suit up.

1074
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,321
Where's your helmet?

1075
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,569
Never wear one. It's a distraction.

1076
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,127
Have you been drinking?

1077
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,362
I need three more clips of 5.56...

1078
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,490
...eight grenades and an extra battery.

1079
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,161
Get it.

1080
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,281
Oi!

1081
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,050
Oi, mate!

1082
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,850
There's something wrong with your suit.

1083
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,284
There's a dead guy in it.

1084
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:26,968
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

1085
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,440
We made it!

1086
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,125
Thank God, we made it!

1087
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,166
Finish it!

1088
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,123
- It isn't there.
- What do you mean?

1089
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,044
My guess is it never was.

1090
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,681
They knew we were coming.
They ambushed us.

1091
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,450
The visions were a trap.

1092
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,247
Just like Rita's visions were a trap at Verdun.

1093
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,251
It could have killed me, but it didn't.
It was after my blood.

1094
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,687
So they know who you are. They...

1095
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,491
They want their power back.

1096
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,849
They're gonna get it one way or another.
Unless we find the Omega.

1097
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,090
- There isn't any other way. We're finished.
- No.

1098
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,283
We're not finished.

1099
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,601
I can't get it to work.

1100
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,285
You built a prototype at Whitehall.

1101
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,841
Yes, and I got fired for it,
thank you very much.

1102
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,884
- What is this thing?
- It's a transponder.

1103
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:09,164
Stick it into the Alpha and it taps into
the wavelength connecting it to the Omega.

1104
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,209
That's the idea, anyway.

1105
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,920
I can't get it to work.
Not with the equipment I have.

1106
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,131
How do we get what you need?

1107
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,931
That's the thing.
When I was at Whitehall, I built one.

1108
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,650
I was even ready to test it.

1109
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,201
When I told my superiors about it,
I lost my job.

1110
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,726
They thought he was crazy.

1111
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,811
So we need to go to Whitehall.

1112
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,720
She'd be arrested...

1113
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,525
...10 feet from the door.
Psych ward, dissection, remember?

1114
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,000
Hey, hey, hey.

1115
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:36,651
Aren't you forgetting something?

1116
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,042
The transponder requires a live Alpha
to make it work.

1117
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,890
We don't need one.

1118
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,361
We got the next best thing.

1119
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,723
When the Chinese delegation comes out...

1120
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,450
...we pick up the pace.

1121
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,645
This guy with the yellow armband
always recognizes you...

1122
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,288
...so just keep your head down
and stay to my right.

1123
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,171
Nicely done.

1124
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,207
Three, two, one. Go.

1125
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,487
One...

1126
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,611
Six, seven...

1127
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:16,841
...eight...

1128
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,041
Twelve...

1129
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,641
Fifteen. Now.

1130
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,689
And, turn.

1131
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,768
Okay. Keep walking.
Just stare straight ahead.

1132
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,641
Robinson.

1133
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,205
I've asked not to be disturbed.
This had better be critical.

1134
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,521
The fate of mankind.

1135
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:37,966
Critical enough?

1136
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,005
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

1137
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,447
I've had more than my share of that.

1138
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,041
Sit down, general. Stay away from the desk.

1139
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,122
I'd take her...

1140
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:47,964
...very seriously if I were you.

1141
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,688
Have to hand it to you, major.

1142
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,605
When you left this office today,
I never imagined you'd be back...

1143
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,207
...let alone with my most decorated soldier.

1144
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,801
I'm gonna tell you a story.
It's gonna sound ridiculous.

1145
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,321
The longer I talk,
the more rational it's going to appear.

1146
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,880
Tell him you'll call back.

1147
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,650
Tell who?

1148
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:09,400
Major General Beaumont, calling from Halifax.
His plane's just been delayed. Bad weather.

1149
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,361
Yes.

1150
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,568
Thank you, Beaumont. I'll call you back.

1151
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,560
Tomorrow's invasion...

1152
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,927
...is a slaughter.
I'm dead within minutes of landing...

1153
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,447
...along with every other soldier
you are sending.

1154
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,200
And that's because the enemy knows
we're coming.

1155
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,442
How do I know this? Before I died...

1156
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,768
...I killed a mimic,
only this one was different.

1157
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,764
It passed something on to me. In my blood.

1158
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,367
Now I live the same day over and over again.

1159
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,641
Just like they do.

1160
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,080
Just like Sergeant Vrataski...

1161
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,446
...at Verdun.

1162
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,967
Tell your secretary everything's fine.

1163
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,326
Beg your pardon?

1164
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,170
Sorry, general. I thought you were alone.

1165
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:50,969
It's fine.

1166
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,288
She typed up those orders
for you to authorize.

1167
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,204
But she left out the ones referring
to the fuel dump...

1168
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,680
...at Greenwich.

1169
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,641
Your name is Iris.

1170
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,161
Your birthday is September 17th.

1171
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,845
The general pulled some strings...

1172
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,760
...stationed your son in Australia,
as far from the war as possible.

1173
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,361
Tell the general...

1174
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,520
...his dinner's been canceled.
Call just came in.

1175
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,881
Your dinner was canceled.

1176
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,330
You forgot the fuel dump.

1177
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:17,962
Thank you, Iris.

1178
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,201
That'll be all.

1179
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,442
- Cage, let's go. Come on.
- Rita.

1180
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,126
- Let me... Don't shoot him again.
- What are we doing?

1181
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,609
Okay? Just...

1182
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,769
General, this isn't the first time
we've had this conversation.

1183
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:45,169
That's because you're stubborn.

1184
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:47,646
You won't believe me when I tell you...

1185
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,968
...that Dr. Carter was right.

1186
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,884
That the enemy can manipulate time.

1187
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:55,488
The invasion will fail.
No matter how many bodies you throw at it.

1188
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,924
The only way to win this war is...

1189
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:02,165
...by finding this power source
of the mimic horde and killing it.

1190
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:05,489
And the only means of finding it
is in that safe right there.

1191
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,970
No matter how many times
we have this conversation...

1192
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:13,483
...you refuse to accept that the enemy breaks
through to London tomorrow...

1193
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,690
...and we lose. We lose everything.

1194
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,360
Let's say for one moment...

1195
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,440
...that I can't rationally explain...

1196
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,490
...your impressive parlor tricks.

1197
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,921
Dr. Carter told me...

1198
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:40,323
...this device requires a live mimic to work.
What use is it to you?

1199
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,080
- That's my concern.
- On the contrary.

1200
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,008
According to you,
this concerns the whole world.

1201
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,969
Well, what would you do if you believed
everything I just told you?

1202
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,521
I would locate this...

1203
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:53,488
Omega.

1204
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,801
Bomb it out of existence.

1205
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,806
You're not mentally equipped to fight
this thing. And you never will be.

1206
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,930
What do we do now?

1207
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,531
I don't know. We've never gotten this far.

1208
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,248
That was easy.

1209
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,362
Down!

1210
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,523
Stop right there! Don't move!

1211
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,285
Nobody move!

1212
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,282
Weapon!

1213
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,161
Stop!

1214
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,045
- They're off and away!
- They're...

1215
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,200
What do I do with this?

1216
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,767
Stick it in your leg. Do it!

1217
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,805
Cage, what's happening?

1218
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,921
<i>Talk to me.</i>

1219
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,887
<i>I feel it. It's taking me there.</i>

1220
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:13,841
<i>What do you see?</i>

1221
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,011
<i>It's the Louvre.</i>

1222
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,360
<i>Where? Where are you?</i>

1223
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,088
<i>I'm inside now. It's flooded.</i>

1224
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,887
<i>Now I'm going down. I'm in a garage.
A garage underneath the museum.</i>

1225
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,650
<i>The Omega. Can you see it?</i>

1226
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,002
It's in Paris.

1227
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:53,723
Rita!

1228
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,851
Stay in the car!

1229
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,729
- Stay back.
- Move away. Move away.

1230
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,410
What have you done?

1231
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,323
What have...

1232
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:39,561
...you done?

1233
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,080
You'll be fine. You just needed blood.

1234
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,162
You don't know...

1235
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,084
...what you've just done.

1236
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,120
I can't talk to you.

1237
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,486
I was with someone.

1238
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,329
Rita Vrataski. Is she alive?

1239
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,127
Rita Vrataski.

1240
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,001
Please.

1241
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,206
Just tell me that.

1242
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:02,208
Please...

1243
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,487
...tell me.

1244
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,761
I'm sorry.

1245
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,320
I was out of those things...

1246
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,360
...in three minutes flat.
What's wrong with you?

1247
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:48,605
I thought you were dead.

1248
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,486
Not yet.

1249
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:56,140
Sorry, Cage.

1250
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,561
No! Whoa. Wait! Wait!

1251
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,040
I'm out. I'm out.

1252
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,765
They gave me blood.

1253
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,451
I lost the power.

1254
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,686
I feel it.

1255
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,522
I can't reset the day anymore.

1256
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,011
We have to kill the Omega...

1257
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,163
...before the invasion starts.

1258
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,162
That gives us less than three hours.

1259
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:37,526
We need a drop ship to get to Paris in time.

1260
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:39,771
Need more soldiers too.

1261
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,721
Now, who's crazy enough
to follow us to Paris?

1262
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,567
Cage!

1263
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,767
Cage!

1264
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,240
- Guys!
- We've been looking...

1265
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,287
...everywhere for you.

1266
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,560
- Just listen.
- Farell almost strung us up...

1267
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:59,041
- ...for losing track of you.
- I know. Just listen.

1268
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,611
You're gonna wanna hear this.

1269
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,484
It's gonna sound ridiculous at first.

1270
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,411
The longer I talk, the more rational
it's going to appear.

1271
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:06,567
Yeah?

1272
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,444
He named the school I went to.

1273
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,646
And then he tells me
my second grade teacher...

1274
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,245
...was called Miss Polio.

1275
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:14,965
She wouldn't let him go to the bathroom...

1276
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,255
...made him wet his pants.

1277
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,122
Shut up.

1278
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,082
Look, I am telling you, man.

1279
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,805
He knows everything.

1280
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:22,927
About all of us.

1281
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,083
- Bullshit.
- Yeah?

1282
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,647
He says your name ain't really Ford.

1283
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,250
Says Ford was your friend.

1284
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,006
Died in combat on his first day.

1285
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,240
You took his place.
Send your checks to his family.

1286
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,728
You slippery bitch.

1287
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:38,880
Cage says the enemy...

1288
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,923
...knows us too.
They're waiting for us.

1289
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,482
And we all die.

1290
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,563
The whole invasion is a slaughter.

1291
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,123
Well, this is great.

1292
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,647
Really good confidence boost for tomorrow.
Thanks.

1293
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,450
But we can change it, right?

1294
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,404
There has to be something that we can do.

1295
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,728
There has to be a way that we can win.

1296
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:00,044
There is a chance. It's a slim one.

1297
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,287
But it means coming with me right now.

1298
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:05,407
Listen, pal.

1299
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:08,291
I don't really care what you think
you know about us.

1300
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,325
We just met you.

1301
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,281
Why follow him into combat?

1302
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,207
I don't expect you to follow me.

1303
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,283
I expect you to follow her.

1304
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,320
- That's the Full Metal Bitch.
- J Squad.

1305
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,649
This is Rita Vrataski.

1306
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,848
- Otherwise known as...
- Yeah, yeah.

1307
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,688
The Angel of Verdun.

1308
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,281
Okay.

1309
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,289
It's a new day, people.

1310
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,965
Destiny calls.

1311
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,488
The world expects only one thing from us: that we will win.

1312
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:09,327
Rest assured the enemy will thank you
for not giving 100 percent today.

1313
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,288
Squad?

1314
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,166
Where's J Squad?

1315
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,888
Right, okay.
So this Omega, it controls time.

1316
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,561
Just blow the New Age bollocks
back where it came from.

1317
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:40,687
And then we go home.

1318
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,926
- Right, it's guarded by an Alpha.
- Just kill it.

1319
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:45,002
Okay?

1320
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,002
No!

1321
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:47,605
You heard what Cage said.

1322
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:49,245
Do not kill an Alpha.

1323
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,608
If we do,
the Omega will reset this whole day.

1324
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,290
We'll never remember
we had this conversation.

1325
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,329
They're gonna know we're coming.

1326
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,080
What am I supposed to do
if an Alpha is about to kill me?

1327
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:01,004
You take a hit for the team.

1328
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,606
When we're on the ground...

1329
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,965
...there's not gonna be a lot of time
before they know we're there.

1330
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,331
We're gonna need eyes up here.

1331
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,005
I'm going in, Cage.

1332
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,530
Thirty seconds till contact.

1333
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:43,883
Cage!

1334
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,565
Kimmel! No!

1335
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:56,242
Ford!

1336
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,049
Let's go!

1337
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:57,820
Cage!

1338
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,960
Talk to me, Rita! We gotta go.

1339
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:00,809
Drop.

1340
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,730
Cage, they know we're coming, man!

1341
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,286
Drop! Drop!

1342
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,007
Drop!

1343
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:08,483
Drop.

1344
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:09,801
You're not hooked in.

1345
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,885
What took you so long?

1346
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,971
Any others?

1347
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,086
We're low on ammo.

1348
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:43,091
I've got one Claymore. Ford, you're out.

1349
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:46,011
Griff has only got half a magazine
and he can hardly move.

1350
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:48,089
I thought you could see the future.

1351
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,685
I haven't lived this day.

1352
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,284
I don't know what's gonna happen.

1353
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,131
It doesn't matter.

1354
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,885
What matters is we finish this.

1355
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:57,846
With what?

1356
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,771
I mean, Griff can't even walk.
We're three men down.

1357
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,520
- Come on.
- We're running out of time.

1358
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:05,324
Collect your ammo.

1359
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,040
Must be a thousand mimics
between us and the pyramid.

1360
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,202
What we gonna do?
Walk up to the front door?

1361
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,562
- If we stay here, we die.
- Yeah?

1362
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,685
We'll never get through.

1363
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,241
We could.

1364
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,081
In that.

1365
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,890
That ship will never fly.

1366
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,171
Doesn't need to fly.

1367
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:29,208
It just needs to get us
across there with speed.

1368
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,282
If the engines are...

1369
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:33,490
...still running,
we could steer it with the power levers.

1370
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:35,562
Skinner.

1371
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:37,601
Clear a path.

1372
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,242
- Try it again, now.
- No, it's not reading.

1373
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:46,320
Condition lever, low.

1374
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,691
Master power, on.

1375
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:58,961
Griff!

1376
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,048
We've gotta go! Come on!

1377
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,842
I'm not gonna be any good in there, mate.

1378
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:09,530
Let me buy you some time.

1379
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,322
Power's on.

1380
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:17,641
This is gonna work.

1381
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,401
Hey!

1382
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:22,202
Hey, come on, man! We gotta go!

1383
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,965
Don't wait for us!

1384
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:24,962
Skinner!

1385
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,690
Griff, come on!

1386
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,126
- We're good to go. Where are they?
- Where's Skinner and Griff?

1387
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:31,886
They're not coming.

1388
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,567
Go, brother. You gotta go, man.

1389
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,245
I'll see you in the next life.

1390
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,086
Bollocks.

1391
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,131
Move over! Move over!

1392
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,971
We gotta go!

1393
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,326
Yo, we gotta go now!

1394
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,724
They're coming, Cage.

1395
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:21,249
Come on, you bastards! Come on!

1396
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:22,646
<i>Reload.</i>

1397
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,564
<i>Reload. Reload.</i>

1398
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,850
We got incoming!

1399
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:48,807
Come on!

1400
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,451
Cage!

1401
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,170
You have to take over!

1402
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:04,483
Rita!

1403
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:08,207
Punch it! Punch it!

1404
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,200
We've been through worse.

1405
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:28,282
Okay.

1406
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:31,561
It's there.

1407
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:33,841
In the water. There.

1408
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,086
That's an Alpha.

1409
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:06,164
I'm gonna draw that thing away.

1410
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:08,406
You kill the Omega.

1411
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:11,325
No. You won't make it 10 feet...

1412
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:13,130
...before that thing kills you, Cage.

1413
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:14,771
- I can do it.
- Take the grenades.

1414
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:15,922
I can do it.

1415
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:17,241
Listen to me.

1416
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,445
Listen to me.

1417
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:22,326
Neither one of us is getting out of here.

1418
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,691
Thank you...

1419
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,603
...for getting me this far.

1420
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,564
You're a good man, Cage.

1421
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,448
I wish I had the chance
to know you better.

1422
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,450
Welcome to London, major.

1423
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:33,960
I'm Corporal Montgomery...

1424
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:36,601
...your liaison to General Brigham's
press office.

1425
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:38,685
Very good to have you.

1426
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,646
Have you heard the news? Isn't it brilliant?

1427
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:53,000
<i>Just before sunrise this morning...</i>

1428
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:56,370
<i>...a large surge of energy
was detected in Paris.</i>

1429
01:43:57,240 --> 01:44:00,050
<i>We do not know exactly what this signifies.</i>

1430
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:01,884
<i>But the result appears to be...</i>

1431
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:04,930
<i>...a total collapse
of the enemy's capacity to fight.</i>

1432
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:10,205
<i>Russian and Chinese troops are now moving
across Europe without resistance.</i>

1433
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:14,971
<i>Tomorrow, we advance on the western front.</i>

1434
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:18,886
<i>We believe we are marching
to claim victory for ourselves...</i>

1435
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:22,411
<i>...for our loved ones, for our countrymen...</i>

1436
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:24,369
<i>...for the entire human race.</i>

1437
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:25,931
What are you? Sound off!

1438
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:26,968
I'm a warrior!

1439
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:28,690
- What do warriors do?
- Kill!

1440
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,570
- What are you gonna do?
- Kill!

1441
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,201
- You have not been in 20 battles.
- I have too.

1442
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,727
You're gonna dump your load
the second you hit the beach.

1443
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:39,407
How about you two go get yourselves
a nice hot cup of shut-the-hell-up!

1444
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:40,562
Ha-ha. You funny, girl.

1445
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,928
I bet you I set some kind of record tomorrow.

1446
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:46,846
Fastest time running backwards, Ford,
slipping in your own shit.

1447
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:48,809
Knock off the grab-ass!

1448
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,561
- What are you? Sound off!
- I'm a warrior!

1449
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:54,922
- What do warriors do?
- Kill!

1450
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:58,440
Attention!

1451
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:39,881
Yes?

1452
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:41,487
What do you want?
