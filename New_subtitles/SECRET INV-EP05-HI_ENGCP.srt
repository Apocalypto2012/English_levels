That's the newer version, not this one.

346
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,750
Huh. Never mind.

347
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,208
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)

348
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:31,792
- This is what we're doing?
- Yes, this is what we're doing.

349
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,125
Seat belt, please.

350
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,083
Off we go.

351
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:55,292
PRISCILLA: Be careful, G'iah.

352
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,958
FURY: Why do you think
Rhodey is in charge of this?

353
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,417
He asked for corroboration
on the New Skrullos site.

354
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,292
And you gave it to him?

355
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,625
Yes, Fury.

356
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:22,375
In the absence of my scaled superior,
I'm the new head of SIS.

357
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:25,375
And last I checked,
Britain and the U.S. were allies.

358
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:28,250
Last I checked, Rhodey is a Skrull.

359
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
What?

360
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:32,917
(SCOFFS) And you said I'd lost my touch.

361
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:37,375
Well, who in the hell
isn't a Skrull these days?

362
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:41,833
Why in God's name would Gravik
want to blow up his own people?

363
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:43,125
Leverage.

364
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:46,333
If I don't give Gravik the Harvest,

365
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:51,333
then Rhodey is going to incinerate
the Skrull compound,

366
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:54,583
including all the Skrulls
and humans trapped inside.

367
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:58,917
Russia will retaliate,
and the world will lose its mind.

368
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:02,625
Yes, yes. War, war. But the Harvest?

369
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,375
Nearly every Avenger spilled blood

370
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:09,042
in the Battle of Earth.

371
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,583
Even Carol Danvers.

372
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:17,500
In the aftermath,
some were sent in to collect that DNA.

373
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:23,042
Some with the ability to blend in.

374
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:29,458
Nobody knew about them
but me and the collectors,

375
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:31,250
- led by...
- Gravik.

376
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,583
Gravik, yes.

377
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:36,583
Which is probably where he got the idea
for the Super Skrull machine.

378
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:42,583
- So you are responsible for all this?
- Yeah.

379
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,792
Why do you think I came back?

380
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,833
A Scandinavian cemetery?
I should've brought my scythe.

381
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:16,833
Only dead men keep secrets.
You taught me that, Sonya.

382
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,750
Fury, why haven't you called
any of your special friends down?

383
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,250
(SIGHS)

384
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,833
This is personal.

385
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,667
We can't keep depending
on these superheroes

386
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,042
to swoop in and save our asses.

387
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,458
None of them have lived the life I have.

388
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:44,250
None of them can defend the world
the way I can.

389
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:48,042
The only power I have

390
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,667
was planted between my ears
by a single mother,

391
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,542
and wrapped around my finger by a woman

392
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,958
who's far greater
than I could ever hope to be.

393
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:03,750
If that ain't enough,
then I don't know what hope we have.

394
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:09,500
If that ain't enough,
maybe I am just dust.

395
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:14,375
Don't you have another one of these?

396
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:18,250
I got these all over the place, you know?
Dead men need options.

397
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,292
Why Finland?

398
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,417
Priscilla and I honeymooned here.

399
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,167
Skrulls like the cold.

400
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,500
Now, you understand.

401
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,083
(BLOWS)

402
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,250
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

403
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:58,833
So, let me clarify.

404
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:01,292
You knew how dangerous this vial was,

405
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:04,083
so swapped its location
to protect it from Gravik,

406
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,083
and now you're going to give it to him.

407
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,125
Exactly.

408
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,667
Well, they do say Darwin never sleeps.

409
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,583
Let's give our extinction a nice leg up.

410
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:20,708
(CHUCKLES)

411
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,333
It's time.

412
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,042
Let's finish this.
