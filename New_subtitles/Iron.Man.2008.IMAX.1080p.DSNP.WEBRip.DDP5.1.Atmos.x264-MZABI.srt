7
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,776
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

8
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,840
This is crazy.
What did I do?

9
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,416
I feel like you're going
to pull over and snuff me.

10
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,880
What, you're not allowed
to talk? Hey, Forrest!

11
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,160
We can talk, sir.

12
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,680
Oh, I see.
So it's personal?

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,040
No, you intimidate them.

14
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,600
Good God, you're a woman.

15
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,320
I honestly...
I couldn't have called that.

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,856
I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't
that what we're going for here?

17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,320
I thought of you
as a soldier first.

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,720
I'm an airman.

19
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,576
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,400
I'm kind of having a hard
time not looking at you now.

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,240
Is that weird?
Come on, it's okay, laugh.

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,080
Sir, I have a question to ask.

23
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,200
Yes, please.

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,960
Is it true you went 12 for 12 with
last year's Maxim cover models?

25
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,200
That is an excellent
question. Yes and no.

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,760
March and I had
a scheduling conflict,

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,760
but fortunately, the
Christmas cover was twins.

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,720
Anything else? You're kidding
me with the hand up, right?

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,560
Is it cool if I take
a picture with you?

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,480
Yes. It's very cool.

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,600
All right.

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,760
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,440
Please, no gang signs.

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,080
No, throw it up.
I'm kidding.

35
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,920
Yeah, peace.
I love peace.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,280
I'd be out of a job with peace.

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,200
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,000
- What's going on?
- Contact left!

39
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,800
What have we got?

40
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,120
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

41
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,720
Stay down!
Yeah.

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,120
Son of a bitch!

43
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,120
Wait, wait, wait!
Give me a gun!

44
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,560
Stay here!

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,160
Whoa!

46
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,920
Tony Stark.

47
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,880
Visionary. Genius.

48
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,400
American patriot.

49
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,840
Even from an early age,

50
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,400
the son of legendary weapons
developer Howard Stark

51
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,040
quickly stole the spotlight with
his brilliant and unique mind.

52
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,560
At age four, he built
his first circuit board.

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,760
At age six, his first engine.

54
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,280
And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.

55
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,640
Then, the passing of a titan.

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,160
Howard Stark's lifelong
friend and ally, Obadiah Stane,

57
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,680
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

58
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,200
until, at age 21,
the prodigal son returns

59
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,080
With the keys to the kingdom,

61
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,960
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

62
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,080
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, satellite targeting.

63
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,080
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry

64
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,960
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America

65
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,600
and her interests
around the globe.

66
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,280
As liaison to Stark Industries,

67
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,640
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

68
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,480
He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

69
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,120
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor

70
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,520
to present this year's Apogee
Award to Mr. Tony Stark.

71
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,080
Tony?

72
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,960
Thank you, Colonel.
Thanks for the save.

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,720
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

74
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
This is wonderful.

75
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,120
But if I were Tony, I would
tell you how honored I feel

77
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,160
and what a joy it is to receive
this very prestigious award.

78
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,040
Tony, you know...

79
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,080
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

80
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,520
He's always working.

81
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,040
Work it! Come on!

82
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,080
We should just
stay till the morning.

83
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
You are unbelievable.

84
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,880
Oh, no! Did they
rope you into this?

85
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,520
Nobody roped me into anything!

86
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,656
I'm so sorry.
But they told me that

87
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,520
if I presented you with an
award, you'd be deeply honored.

88
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,576
Of course I'd be deeply
honored. And it's you, that's great.

89
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,320
So when do we do it?
It's right here.

90
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,560
Here you go. There
it is. That was easy.

91
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it's okay.

92
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,400
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

93
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,096
I don't have any of those
floating around.

94
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,200
We're gonna let it ride!

95
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,536
Give me a hand, will you? Give
me a little something-something.

96
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,680
Okay, you, too.

97
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,680
I don't blow on a man's dice.
Come on, honey bear.

98
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,240
There it is. Lieutenant
Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

99
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,560
Two craps.
Line away.

100
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,520
That's what happens.
Worse things have happened.

101
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,496
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?

102
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,576
This is where I exit.
All right.

103
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Tomorrow, don't be late.

104
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,016
Yeah, you can count on it.
I'm serious!

105
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,320
I know, I know.

106
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,920
Render unto Caesar that
which is Caesar's. There you go.

107
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,600
Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

108
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,200
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

109
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,399
Can I ask you
a couple of questions?

110
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,920
She's cute.
She's all right?

111
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,080
Hi.
Hi.

112
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,080
Yeah. Okay, go.
It's okay?

113
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,000
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

114
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,920
What do you say to that?
Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,656
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

116
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,880
"The Merchant of Death"?

117
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,480
That's not bad.

118
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,320
Let me guess. Berkeley?

119
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,560
Brown, actually.

120
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,040
Well, Ms. Brown,

121
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,576
it's an imperfect world, but
it's the only one we've got.

122
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,416
I guarantee you, the day weapons
are no longer needed to keep the peace,

123
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,600
I'll start making bricks and
beams for baby hospitals.

124
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,800
Rehearse that much?

125
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,576
Every night in front of
the mirror before bedtime.

126
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,639
I can see that.

127
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,960
I'd like to show you first-hand.

128
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,280
All I want is a serious answer.

129
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,640
Okay, here's serious. My
old man had a philosophy,

130
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,120
"Peace means having a
bigger stick than the other guy."

131
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,480
That's a great line coming
from the guy selling the sticks.

132
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,880
My father helped
defeat the Nazis.

133
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,360
He worked on
the Manhattan Project.

134
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,000
A lot of people, including
your professors at Brown,

135
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,320
would call that being a hero.

136
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,616
And a lot of people would
also call that war profiteering.

137
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,816
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

138
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,640
by advancing medical technology

139
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,080
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

140
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,400
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,920
You ever lose an hour
of sleep your whole life?

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,880
I'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.

143
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,816
Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.

144
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,520
The weather in Malibu is 72
degrees with scattered clouds.

145
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,000
The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.

146
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,520
High tide will
be at 10:52 a.m.

147
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,160
MALIBU, CALIFORNIA

148
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,880
Tony?

149
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,640
Hey, Tony?

150
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,776
You are not authorized
to access this area.

151
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,520
Jesus. That's Jarvis.
He runs the house.

152
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,640
I've got your clothes here. They've
been dry-cleaned and pressed,

153
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,480
and there's a car
waiting for you outside

154
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,880
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

155
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,680
You must be the
famous Pepper Potts.

156
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,440
Indeed I am.

157
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,200
After all these years, Tony still
has you picking up the dry-cleaning.

158
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,640
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

159
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,520
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

160
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,680
Will that be all?

161
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,976
Sometimes I try to do things

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,320
but it just doesn't work out
the way I want it to,

163
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,600
and I get real frustrated

164
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
and then, like,
I try hard to do it

165
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,040
and I, like, take my time

166
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,896
but it just doesn't work out
the way I want it to.

167
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,080
It's like I concentrate
on it real hard

168
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,560
but it just doesn't work out.

169
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,240
Give me an exploded view.

170
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,560
The compression in
cylinder three appears to be low.

171
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,200
Log that.

172
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,016
I'm gonna try again, right now.

173
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,096
Please don't turn down my music.

174
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
I'll keep you posted.

175
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,016
You are supposed to be halfway
around the world right now.

176
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,120
How'd she take it?

177
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,400
Like a champ.

178
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,096
Why are you trying to
hustle me out of here?

179
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,896
Your flight was scheduled to
leave an hour and a half ago.

180
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,080
That's funny, I thought with
it being my plane and all,

181
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,736
that it would just wait
for me to get there.

182
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,576
Tony, I need to speak to
you about a couple things

183
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,736
before I get you
out of the door.

184
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,056
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

185
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,360
if it departs before you arrive?

186
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,760
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

187
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,480
Do you want it?
Yes or no.

188
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,640
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

189
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,920
No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

190
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,280
where he lived and worked,

191
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,840
not "spring" like the season.
So?

192
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,040
I think it's a fair example.

193
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,320
I think it's
incredibly overpriced.

194
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,760
I need it.
Buy it. Store it.

195
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,120
Okay. The MIT
commencement speech...

196
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,056
Is in June. Please, don't harangue
me about stuff that's way, way, down...

197
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,480
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

198
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,136
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

199
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,576
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

200
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,576
What are you trying to get rid
of me for? What, you got plans?

201
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,680
As a matter of fact, I do.

202
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,136
I don't like it
when you have plans.

203
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,240
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

204
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,840
It's your birthday?
Yes.

205
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,400
I knew that. Already?

206
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

207
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,296
Get yourself
something nice from me.

208
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,520
I already did.

209
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
And?

210
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,160
Oh, it was very nice.

211
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,520
Yeah. Very tasteful.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

212
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,360
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

213
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
Okay.

214
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,560
You're good. Oh, I thought
I lost you back there.

215
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,080
You did, sir. I had to
cut across Mulholland.

216
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,760
I got you.
I got you.

217
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,280
What's wrong with you?

218
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,880
What?
Three hours.

219
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,120
I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

220
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,216
For three hours. For three
hours you got me standing here.

221
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,760
Waiting on you now.
Let's go. Come on.

222
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Wheels up!
Rock and roll!

223
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,080
What you reading, platypus?
Nothing.

224
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,360
Come on, sour patch.
Don't be mad.

225
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,160
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

226
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,736
I said I was sorry.
Good morning, Mr. Stark.

227
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,976
You don't need to apologize
to me. I'm your man.

228
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,056
Hi. I told him
I was sorry, but he...

229
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,576
I'm just indifferent
right now. Hot towel?

230
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
You don't respect yourself,

231
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,296
so I know you don't
respect me. I respect you.

232
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,680
I'm just your babysitter.

233
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,280
So, when you need your
diaper changed... Thank you.

234
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,520
Let me know and
I'll get you a bottle, okay?

235
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,280
Hey! Heat up the sake,
will you?

236
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,776
Thanks for reminding me.
No, I'm not talking...

237
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,600
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

238
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,120
You can't have sashimi without
sake. You are constitutionally

239
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,760
incapable of being responsible.

240
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,296
It would be
irresponsible not to drink.

241
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,416
I'm just talking
about a nightcap.

242
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,520
Hot sake?

243
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,640
Yes, two, please.
No.

244
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,960
I'm not drinking.
I don't want any.

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,360
That's what I'm talking about.

246
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,520
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

247
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,320
you know what I recognize?

248
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,680
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

249
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,480
Hey, you know what? I'm
not like you. I'm not cut out...

250
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,040
No, no. You don't
have to be like me!

251
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,640
But you're more
than what you are.

252
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,560
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

253
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,680
No! You can't be distracted
right now! Listen to me!

254
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
General.

255
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,040
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look
forward to your weapons presentation.

256
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,160
Thanks.

257
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,920
Is it better to be
feared or respected?

258
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,160
I say, is it too
much to ask for both?

259
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,000
With that in mind, I humbly
present the crown jewel

260
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,880
of Stark Industries'
Freedom Line.

261
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,056
It's the first missile system

262
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,960
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

263
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

264
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,080
I respectfully disagree.

265
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,200
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

266
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,640
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

267
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,520
And it's worked out
pretty well so far.

268
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,000
Find an excuse

269
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,360
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

270
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,000
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

271
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,240
For your consideration,
the Jericho.

272
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,896
I'll be throwing one of these in

273
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,960
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

274
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,080
To peace!

275
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,880
Tony.
Obie, what are you doing up?

276
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,440
I couldn't sleep till I found
out how it went. How'd it go?

277
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,416
It went great. Looks like it's
gonna be an early Christmas.

278
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,280
Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

279
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,896
Why aren't you wearing
those pajamas I got you?

280
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,520
Good night, Tony.

281
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,400
Hey, Tony. I'm sorry,
this is the "fun-vee."

282
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
The "hum-drum-vee"
is back there.

283
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,840
Nice job.

284
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,240
See you back at base.

285
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,320
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

286
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,720
What the hell did you do to me?

287
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,080
What I did?

288
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,160
What I did is to save your life.

289
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,040
I removed all the shrapnel
I could, but there's a lot left,

290
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,920
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.

291
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,440
Here, want to see?

292
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,920
I have a souvenir.
Take a look.

293
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,840
I've seen many wounds
like that in my village.

294
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,360
We call them the walking dead

295
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,600
because it takes about a week for
the barbs to reach the vital organs.

296
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,480
What is this?
That is an electromagnet,

297
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,400
hooked up to a car battery,

298
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,400
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart. Hmm?

299
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,760
That's right. Smile.

300
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,600
We met once, you know, at a
technical conference in Bern.

301
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,640
I don't remember.
No, you wouldn't.

302
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,120
If I had been that drunk, I
wouldn't have been able to stand,

303
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,360
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

304
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,760
Where are we?

305
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,600
Come on,
stand up. Stand up!

306
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,600
Just do as I do.

307
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,360
Come on, put your hands up.

308
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,599
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

309
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,040
Do you understand me?
Do as I do.

310
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,720
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

311
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,640
"in the history of America."

312
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,600
He is honored.

313
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,880
He wants you to
build the missile.

314
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,600
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

315
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,320
This one.

316
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,440
I refuse.

317
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Tony!

318
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,520
He wants to know what you think.

319
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,280
I think you got
a lot of my weapons.

320
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,400
He says they have everything
you need to build the Jericho missile.

321
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,120
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

322
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,000
He says for you
to start working immediately,

323
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,360
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

324
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,040
No, he won't.

325
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,880
No, he won't.

326
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,560
I'm sure they're
looking for you, Stark.

327
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,760
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

328
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,120
Look, what you just saw,

329
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,000
that is your legacy, Stark.

330
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,000
Your life's work, in the
hands of those murderers.

331
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,400
Is that how you want to go out?

332
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,880
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

333
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,240
Or are you going to
do something about it?

334
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,400
Why should I do anything? They're
going to kill me, you, either way.

335
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,760
And if they don't, I'll
probably be dead in a week.

336
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,160
Well, then,

337
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,880
this is a very important
week for you, isn't it?

338
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Hmm?

339
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,136
If this is going to be
my work station,

340
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,400
I
want it well-lit. I want these up.

341
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,520
I need welding gear. I don't
care if it's acetylene or propane.

342
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,816
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

343
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,240
I would like a smelting cup.

344
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,800
I need two sets
of precision tools.

345
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,560
How many languages do you speak?

346
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,680
A lot.

347
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,480
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

348
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,600
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

349
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,080
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

350
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,440
Who are these people?

351
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,520
They are your
loyal customers, sir.

352
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,240
They call
themselves the Ten Rings.

353
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,120
You know,
we might be more productive

354
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,000
if you include me
in the planning process.

355
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Uh-huh.

356
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,800
Okay, we don't need this.

357
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,240
What is that?

358
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,080
That's palladium,
0.15 grams.

359
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,120
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

360
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,160
WHAT'S HE DOING?

361
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,200
WORKING.

362
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,640
Careful. Careful,
we only get one shot at this.

363
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,440
Relax. I have steady hands.

364
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,920
Why do you think
you're still alive? Huh?

365
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,160
What do I call you?

366
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,880
My name is Yinsen.

367
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,440
Yinsen.
Nice to meet you.

368
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,200
Nice to meet you, too.

369
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,520
That doesn't look
like a Jericho missile.

370
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,080
That's because it's a
miniaturized arc reactor.

371
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,200
I got a big one powering
my factory at home.

372
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,280
It should keep the
shrapnel out of my heart.

373
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,040
But what could it generate?

374
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,680
If my math is right, and it always
is, three gigajoules per second.

375
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,680
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

376
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,800
Yeah. Or something
big for 15 minutes.

377
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,080
This is our ticket out of here.

378
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,800
What is it?

379
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,200
Flatten them out and look.

380
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Oh, wow.

381
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,440
Impressive.

382
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,440
Good.

383
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,200
Good roll.
Good roll.

384
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,880
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

385
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,760
I'm from a small
town called Gulmira.

386
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,760
It's actually a nice place.

387
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,600
Got a family?

388
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,000
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

389
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,400
And you, Stark?

390
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,560
No.

391
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,160
No?

392
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,080
So you're a man
who has everything

393
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,120
and nothing.

394
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,200
IT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THE
PICTURE.

395
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,800
MAYBE IT'S BEEN MODIFIED.

396
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,960
THE TAIL IS WRONG.

397
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,080
IT'S JUST BACKWARDS.

398
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,720
Relax.

399
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,040
The bow and arrow

400
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,000
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

401
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,960
It allowed the great
Genghis Khan

402
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,760
to rule from the
Pacific to the Ukraine.

403
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,080
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

404
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,760
and four times the size
of the Roman Empire.

405
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,720
But today,

406
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,000
whoever holds
the latest Stark weapons

407
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,920
rules these lands.

408
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,560
And soon,

409
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,280
it will be my turn.

410
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,960
WHY HAVE YOU FAILED ME?

411
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,680
WE'RE WORKING.

412
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,400
DILIGENTLY.

413
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,440
I LET YOU LIVE.

414
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,480
THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME?

415
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,760
IT'S VERY COMPLEX.

416
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,160
HE'S TRYING VERY HARD.

417
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
ON HIS KNEES.

418
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,080
YOU THINK I'M A FOOL?

419
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,080
I'll GET THE TRUTH.

420
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,200
WE'RE BOTH WORKING.

421
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,800
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

422
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,960
What does he want?

423
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,520
YOU THINK I'M A FOOL?

424
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,840
WHAT'S GOING ON?

425
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,840
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

426
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,600
HE'S BUILDING YOUR JERICHO.

427
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,880
What do you want?
A delivery date?

428
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,480
I need him.

429
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,160
Good assistant.

430
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

431
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,160
Okay? Can you move?

432
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,480
Okay, say it again.

433
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,080
41 steps straight ahead.
Then 16 steps,

434
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,640
that's from the door, fork
right, 33 steps, turn right.

435
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
WHERE IS STARK?

436
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,920
HE WAS HERE A MOMENT AGO.

437
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,480
GO LOOK FOR HIM.

438
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,360
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

439
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,480
Say something.
Say something back to him.

440
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,960
He's speaking Hungarian. I
don't... Then speak Hungarian.

441
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,240
Okay. I know.

442
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,480
What do you know?

443
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,920
How'd that work?
Oh, my goodness.

444
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,000
It worked all right.
That's what I do.

445
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,640
Let me finish this.
Initialize the power sequence.

446
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
Okay.

447
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,320
Now! Tell me. Tell me.

448
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,160
Function 11.

449
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,000
Tell me when you
see a progress bar.

450
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,680
It should be up right now.
Yes.

451
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,936
Talk to me. Tell
me when you see it.

452
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,480
I have it.
Press Control "I".

453
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,000
"I." Got it. "I." "Enter."
"I" and "Enter."

454
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,840
Come over here and button me up.

455
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,040
Okay. All right.

456
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,480
Every other hex bolt.

457
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,680
They're coming! Nothing
pretty, just get it done.

458
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,120
Just get it done.
They're coming.

459
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,896
Make sure the checkpoints are
clear before you follow me out, okay?

460
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,680
We need more time.

461
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
Hey,

462
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,200
I'm gonna go buy you some time.

463
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,880
Stick to the plan!

464
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,080
Stick to the plan!

465
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,240
Yinsen!

466
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,160
Yinsen!

467
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,360
Watch out!

468
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,640
Stark.

469
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,040
Come on.
We got to go.

470
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,680
Move for me, come on. We got
a plan. We're gonna stick to it.

471
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,680
This was always the plan, Stark.

472
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,280
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

473
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,720
My family is dead.

474
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,800
I'm going to see
them now, Stark.

475
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,720
It's okay.

476
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,760
I want this.
I want this.

477
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,720
Thank you for saving me.

478
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,160
Don't waste it.
Don't waste your life.

479
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,240
My turn.

480
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,840
Not bad.

481
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,120
Hey!

482
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,640
How was the "fun-vee"?

483
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,320
Next time,
you ride with me, okay?

484
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,160
Watch it, coming up here.

485
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,280
Are you kidding
me with this? Get rid of them.

486
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,440
Hmm.

487
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,880
Your eyes are red. A few
tears for your long-lost boss?

488
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,440
Tears of joy.
I hate job hunting.

489
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,520
Yeah, vacation's over.

490
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,440
Where to, sir?

491
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,176
Take us to the hospital,
please, Happy. No.

492
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,320
No? Tony, you have to

493
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,456
go to the hospital.
No is a complete answer.

494
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,296
The doctor has to look at
you. I don't have to do anything.

495
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,000
I've been in captivity
for three months.

496
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,840
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

497
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,936
and the other...
That's enough of that.

498
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,416
...is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

499
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,736
Call for a press conference?
Yeah.

500
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,320
What on earth for? Hogan,
drive. Cheeseburger first.

501
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,560
Look at this!

502
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,600
Tony.

503
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,376
We were going to
meet at the hospital.

504
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,840
No, I'm fine.

505
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,280
Look at you!

506
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,440
You had to have a burger,
yeah? Well, come on.

507
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,680
You get me one of those?

508
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,040
There's only one left.
I need it.

509
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,760
Hey, look
who's here! Yeah!

510
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,640
Miss Potts?
Yes.

511
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,000
Can I speak to you for a moment?

512
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,200
I'm not part of
the press conference,

513
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,680
but it's about to
begin right now.

514
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,080
I'm not a reporter.

515
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,600
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,

516
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,456
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

517
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,120
and Logistics Division.

518
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,440
That's quite a mouthful.

519
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,920
I know.
We're working on it.

520
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,440
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

521
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,200
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

522
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,960
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about
the circumstances of his escape.

523
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,576
I'll put something
in the book, shall I?

524
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,200
Thank you.

525
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,320
Uh...

526
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,720
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

527
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,200
Why don't you just sit down? That
way you can see me, and I can...

528
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,480
A little less formal and...

529
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,880
What's up with the love-in?

530
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,040
Don't look at me.

531
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,200
I don't know what he's up to.

532
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,400
Good to see you.

533
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,680
Good to see you.

534
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,200
I never got to say
goodbye to Dad.

535
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,160
I never got to say
goodbye to my father.

536
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,296
There's questions that
I would have asked him.

537
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,400
I would have asked him how he
felt about what this company did.

538
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,800
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

539
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,000
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

540
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,480
I saw young Americans killed

541
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,360
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

542
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,160
And I saw

543
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,960
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

544
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,240
Mr. Stark!
Hey, Ben.

545
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,240
What happened over there?

546
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,520
I had my eyes opened. I
came to realize that I have more

547
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,000
to offer this world than just
making things that blow up.

548
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,520
And that is why, effective
immediately, I am shutting down

549
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,280
the weapons manufacturing
division of Stark International

550
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,360
until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.

551
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,056
I think we're gonna be
selling a lot of newspapers.

552
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,896
What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with

553
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,000
and is consistent with the highest
good for this country, as well.

554
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:09,160
What we should take away
from this is that Tony's back!

555
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,880
And he's healthier than ever.

556
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,400
We're going to have
a little internal discussion

557
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,920
and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.

558
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,360
Where is he?
He's inside.

559
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,080
Well, that...
That went well.

560
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,600
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

561
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,000
Your head?
What about my head?

562
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,080
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

563
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,760
Uh, optimistically,
40 points.

564
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,280
At minimum.

565
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,680
Yep.

566
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,280
Tony, we're
a weapons manufacturer.

567
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,040
Obie, I just don't want a body
count to be our only legacy.

568
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,720
That's what we do. We're iron
mongers. We make weapons.

569
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,016
It's my name on the
side of the building.

570
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,640
And what we do keeps the
world from falling into chaos.

571
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,680
Not based on what I saw.

572
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,976
We're not doing
a good enough job.

573
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,296
We can do better. We're
gonna do something else.

574
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,520
Like what?

575
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,000
You want us to
make baby bottles?

576
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,480
I think we should take another
look into arc reactor technology.

577
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,920
Ah, come on. The arc
reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

578
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,400
Tony, come on. We built that
thing to shut the hippies up!

579
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,600
It works.
Yeah, as a science project.

580
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,560
The arc was
never cost effective.

581
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,360
We knew that before we built it.

582
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,600
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

583
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,800
Maybe.

584
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,840
Huh? Am I right? We haven't
had a breakthrough in that in what?

585
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,480
30 years.
That's what they say.

586
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,376
Could you have a lousier poker
face? Just tell me, who told you?

587
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,640
Never mind who told me.
Show me. It's Rhodey or Pepper.

588
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,040
I want to see it.
Okay, Rhodey.

589
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,960
Okay.
Okay?

590
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,520
It works.

591
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,720
Listen to me, Tony. We're
a team. Do you understand?

592
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,080
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

593
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,560
like your father and I.

594
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,440
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

595
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,120
But if I had...
Tony.

596
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,200
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

597
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,040
You understand me?
That was Dad's line.

598
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,800
You gotta let me handle this.

599
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,280
We're gonna have to play a
whole different kind of ball now.

600
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,200
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

601
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,520
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

602
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,560
Stark Industries!

603
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,520
I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?

604
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,720
Sell, sell, sell!

605
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,920
Abandon ship!

606
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,400
Does the Hindenburg
ring any bells?

607
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,680
Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!

608
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,600
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!

609
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,600
Pepper.
How big are your hands?

610
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,360
What?
How big are your hands?

611
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,320
I don't understand why...
Get down here. I need you.

612
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,760
Hey.

613
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,320
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.

614
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,440
Let's see them.

615
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,840
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

616
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,320
I just need your help for a sec.

617
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,320
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

618
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,920
It was.
It is now an antique.

619
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,560
This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.

620
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,600
I'm swapping it up
for an upgraded unit,

621
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,920
and I just ran into
a little speed bump.

622
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,920
Speed bump, what does that mean?

623
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,336
It's nothing.
It's just a little snag.

624
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,720
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

625
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,960
And it's contacting the socket
wall and causing a little bit of a short.

626
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,680
It's fine.

627
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,536
What do you want me to do?
Put that on the table over there.

628
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,360
That is irrelevant.
Oh, my God!

629
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,760
I want you to reach in, and you're
just gonna gently lift the wire out.

630
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,640
Is it safe?
Yeah, it should be fine.

631
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,416
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

632
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,800
the socket wall
or it goes "beep."

633
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,976
What do you mean, "Operation"?

634
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,360
It's just a game, never mind.

635
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,480
Just gently lift the wire.
Okay? Great. Okay.

636
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,800
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

637
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,920
No, you're fine. You're
the most capable, qualified,

638
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,520
trustworthy person I've ever
met. You're gonna do great.

639
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,800
Is it too much of a problem
to ask? 'Cause I'm...

640
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,520
Okay, okay.
I really need your help here.

641
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,760
Okay.

642
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,680
Oh, there's pus!

643
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:47,360
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

644
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,360
not from my body.
It smells!

645
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,000
Yeah, it does.

646
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,640
The copper wire.

647
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,040
The copper wire, you got it?

648
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,336
Okay, I got it! I got it!
Okay, you got it?

649
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,360
Now, don't let it.

650
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,320
touch the sides
when you're coming out!

651
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,360
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

652
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,816
That's what I was
trying to tell you before.

653
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,039
Okay, now make sure that
when you pull it out, you don't...

654
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,960
There's a magnet at
the end of it! That was it.

655
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,096
You just pulled it out.

656
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,336
Oh, God!
Okay, I was not expecting...

657
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,536
Don't put it back in! Don't put
it back in! Okay, what do I do?

658
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,600
What's wrong?

659
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,336
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest
'cause you yanked it out like a trout...

660
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,280
What? You said it was safe! We
gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

661
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,360
You gotta switch it out
really quick. Okay. Okay.

662
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,480
Tony? It's going to be okay.
What?

663
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,520
Is it?
It's gonna be okay.

664
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,280
I'm gonna make this okay.
Let's hope.

665
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,920
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

666
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,400
Was that so hard?
That was fun, right?

667
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,200
Here, I got it.
I got it. Here.

668
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,760
Nice.

669
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,120
Are you okay?
Yeah, I feel great.

670
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,440
You okay?

671
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,760
Don't ever, ever, ever,

672
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,840
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

673
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,080
I don't have anyone but you.

674
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,720
Anyway...

675
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,040
What do you want me
to do with this?

676
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,520
That?

677
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,680
Destroy it.

678
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,720
Incinerate it.

679
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,000
You don't want to keep it?

680
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:18,240
Pepper, I've been called many
things. "Nostalgic" is not one of them.

681
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,160
Will that be all,
Mr. Stark?

682
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,040
That will be all, Miss Potts.

683
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,920
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

684
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,920
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

685
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,240
That's my phone, that's a
picture of me and my dad.

686
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,240
Right there. In the
garbage. All that stuff.

687
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,680
The future of air
combat. Is it manned or unmanned?

688
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,120
I'll tell you, in my experience,

689
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,960
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

690
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,600
his insight,

691
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,680
that ability to look into a
situation beyond the obvious

692
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,400
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

693
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,600
Colonel?

694
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,480
Why not a pilot
without the plane?

695
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,600
Look who fell out of
the sky. Mr. Tony Stark.

696
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,560
Hello, sir. Speaking of
manned or unmanned,

697
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,536
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

698
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,200
at spring break. Just remember
that, spring break, 1987.

699
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,616
That lovely lady you
woke up with. Don't do that!

700
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,040
What was his name?
Don't do that.

701
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,200
Was it Ivan?
Don't do that.

702
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,536
They'll believe it.
Don't do that.

703
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,760
Okay.
Don't do that.

704
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,840
Pleasure meeting you. Give
us a couple minutes, you guys.

705
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,400
I'm surprised.
Why?

706
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,200
I swear, I didn't expect to see
you walking around so soon.

707
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,160
I'm doing a little
better than walking.

708
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,720
Really?
Yeah.

709
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,040
Rhodey, I'm working on
something big.

710
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,160
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

711
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,936
You're about to make a whole lot
of people around here real happy,

712
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,960
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

713
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,640
that was a doozy.

714
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,520
This is not for the military.
I'm not... It's different.

715
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,280
What? You're a humanitarian
now or something?

716
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,760
I need you to listen to me.
No.

717
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,760
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

718
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,200
I'm serious.
Okay.

719
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,320
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

720
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,600
Thanks.

721
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,560
Jarvis, you up?

722
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,200
For you, sir, always.

723
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,400
I'd like to open a new
project file, index as Mark II.

724
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,280
Shall I store this on the Stark
Industries Central Database?

725
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,960
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

726
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,656
Till further notice, why
don't we just keep everything

727
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,919
on my private server?

728
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,680
Working on a secret
project, are we, sir?

729
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,760
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

730
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,360
Maybe in mine, it can
actually do some good.

731
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,320
Next. Up.

732
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,880
Not in the boot, Dummy.
Right here. You got me?

733
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,040
Stay put. Nice.

734
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,680
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

735
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,320
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I in your way?

736
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,400
Up.

737
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,080
Screw it. Don't even move.

738
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,200
You are a tragedy.

739
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,680
Okay, let's do this right.

740
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,160
Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.

741
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,120
Dummy, look alive. You're
on standby for fire safety.

742
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,640
You, roll it.

743
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,520
Okay. Activate
hand controls.

744
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,056
We're gonna start
off nice and easy.

745
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,280
We're gonna see if 10%
thrust capacity achieves lift.

746
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,680
And three,

747
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,560
two,

748
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,520
one.

749
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,920
Up two.
All right, set that.

750
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,400
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

751
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,320
Yeah, everything's... What?

752
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,560
Obadiah's upstairs.
Great!

753
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,960
What would you like me to
tell him? Great. I'll be right up.

754
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,360
Okay.

755
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,000
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

756
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,040
It is.

757
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,080
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

758
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,400
I didn't expect that.

759
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,120
How'd it go?

760
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,040
It went that bad, huh?

761
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,760
Just because I brought
pizza back from New York

762
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,720
doesn't mean it went bad.
Uh-huh. Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

763
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,680
It would have gone better
if you were there. Uh-uh.

764
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,536
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

765
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,840
I lay low, and you take
care of all... Hey, come on.

766
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,120
In public.
The press.

767
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,680
This was a board of
directors meeting.

768
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,800
This was a board of
directors meeting?

769
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,880
The board is claiming
you have post traumatic stress.

770
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,096
They're filing an injunction.

771
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,200
A what?
They want to lock you out.

772
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,576
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

773
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,616
We knew that was gonna happen.

774
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,760
Fifty-six and a half.
It doesn't matter.

775
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,040
We own the controlling
interest in the company.

776
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,880
Tony, the board has rights, too.

777
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,640
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

778
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,016
isn't in the company's best
interest. I'm being responsible!

779
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,080
That's a new direction
for me, for the company.

780
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,880
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

781
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,000
This is great.

782
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,520
Oh, come on. Tony.
Tony. I'll be in the shop.

783
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,840
Hey, hey!
Hey, Tony. Listen.

784
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,240
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

785
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,920
Something to pitch them.

786
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,520
Let me have the engineers analyze
that. You know, draw up some specs.

787
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,776
No. No, absolutely not. It'll
give me a bone to throw the boys

788
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,400
in New York!
This one stays with me.

789
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,520
That's it, Obie.
Forget it.

790
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,320
All right, well,
this stays with me, then.

791
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,240
Go on, here,
you can have a piece.

792
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,800
Take two.
Thank you.

793
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,816
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

794
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,480
Good night, Obie.

795
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:26,960
Day 11, test 37, configuration
2.0. For lack of a better option,

796
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,680
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

797
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,600
and I'm not on fire, I'm
donating you to a city college.

798
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,520
All right, nice and easy.

799
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,520
Seriously, just gonna start
off with 1% thrust capacity.

800
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,160
And three, two, one.

801
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,000
Okay.

802
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,976
Please don't follow
me around with it, either,

803
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,440
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

804
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,256
Just stand down! If something
happens, then come in.

805
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,560
And again,
let's bring it up to 2.5.

806
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,240
Three, two, one.

807
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,400
Okay, this is where
I don't want to be!

808
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,840
Oh, not the car, not the car!

809
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,160
Table!

810
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,400
Could be worse! Could
be worse! We're fine! Okay.

811
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,000
No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Uh!

812
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,760
Yeah, I can fly.

813
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,480
Jarvis, are you there?
At your service, sir.

814
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,640
Engage Heads Up Display.

815
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,800
Check.

816
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,920
Import all preferences
from home interface.

817
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,480
Will do, sir.

818
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,456
All right, what do you say?

819
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,000
I have indeed been uploaded,
sir. We're online and ready.

820
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,720
Can we start
the virtual walk-around?

821
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,840
Importing preferences and
calibrating virtual environment.

822
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,200
Do a check on control surfaces.

823
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,840
As you wish.

824
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,280
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.

825
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,280
Uh, yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

826
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,840
Start listening in
on ground control.

827
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,056
Sir, there are still terabytes

828
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,680
of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...

829
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,680
Jarvis! Sometimes you got
to run before you can walk.

830
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:23,080
Ready? In three, two, one.

831
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,200
Handles like a dream.

832
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,896
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

833
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,360
What's SR-71's record?

834
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,280
The altitude record for fixed
wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.

835
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,360
Records are made
to be broken! Come on!

836
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,160
Sir, there is a potentially
fatal buildup of ice occurring.

837
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,320
Keep going!

838
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,920
Higher!

839
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,880
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

840
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,960
Come on,
we got to break the ice!

841
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,520
Kill power.

842
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,080
Notes. Main transducer feels
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.

843
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,040
Hull pressurization
is problematic.

844
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,600
I'm thinking icing
is the probable factor.

845
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,920
A very astute
observation, sir.

846
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,760
Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,

847
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,320
we should improve
the exosystems.

848
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,960
Connect to the sys. Co. Have
it reconfigure the shell metals.

849
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:21,160
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

850
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,040
That should ensure
a fuselage integrity

851
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,120
while maintaining
power-to-weight ratio.

852
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,440
Got it?
Yes.

853
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,880
Shall I render using
proposed specifications?

854
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,280
Thrill me.

855
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,840
Tonight's red-hot red carpet

856
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,240
is right here at
the Disney Concert Hall,

857
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,640
where Tony Stark's
third annual benefit

858
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,600
for the Firefighter's
Family Fund

859
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,256
has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.

860
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,600
Jarvis, we get an
invite for that?

861
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,160
I have no record
of an invitation, sir.

862
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,776
...hasn't
been seen in public

863
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,520
since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.

864
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:54,400
Some claim he's suffering
from post traumatic stress

865
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,080
and has been bedridden for
weeks. Whatever the case may be,

866
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,320
no one expects an
appearance from him tonight.

867
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,560
The render is complete.

868
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,320
A little ostentatious,
don't you think?

869
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,480
What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

870
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,720
Tell you what. Throw a
little hot-rod red in there.

871
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,680
Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.

872
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,800
The render is complete.

873
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,160
Hey, I like it.
Fabricate it. Paint it.

874
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,840
Commencing automated assembly.

875
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,080
Estimated completion
time is five hours.

876
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,360
Don't wait up for me, honey.

877
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:57,240
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

878
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,080
is all about,
and our partnership.

879
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,400
with
the fire and rescue community...

880
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,400
Hey, Tony, remember me?

881
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,720
Sure don't.

882
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,240
You look great, Hef.

883
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,480
We're going to
have a great quarter.

884
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,240
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

885
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:20,560
Look at you.
Hey, what a surprise.

886
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,400
I'll see you inside.

887
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,240
Hey. Listen, take
it slow, all right?

888
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,096
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

889
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,720
You got it. Just cabin
fever. I'll just be a minute.

890
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,120
Give me a Scotch.
I'm starving.

891
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,240
Mr. Stark?

892
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,240
Yeah?
Agent Coulson.

893
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,960
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

894
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,360
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

895
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,080
God, you need
a new name for that.

896
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,120
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

897
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,760
Listen, I know this must be a trying
time for you, but we need to debrief you.

898
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,800
There's still a lot of
unanswered questions,

899
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,760
and time can be a factor
with these things.

900
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,880
Let's just put
something on the books.

901
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,320
How about the 24th at
7:00 p.m. at Stark Industries?

902
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,920
Tell you what. You got it.
You're absolutely right.

903
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:14,400
Well, I'm going to go to my
assistant, and we'll make a date.

904
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,960
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

905
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,280
What are you doing here? Just
avoiding government agents.

906
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,216
Are you by yourself? Yes.
Where'd you get that dress?

907
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,080
Oh, it was a birthday
present. That's great.

908
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,280
From you, actually.
Well, I got great taste.

909
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,640
Yes.

910
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,640
You want to dance?
Oh, no.

911
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,200
All right, come on.
Thank you. No.

912
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,840
Am I making you uncomfortable?

913
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:50,520
No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

914
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,440
in front of everyone that I work
with in a dress with no back.

915
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,936
You look great
and you smell great.

916
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,280
Oh, God.

917
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,296
But I could fire you if that
would take the edge off.

918
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:03,000
I actually don't think that you
could tie your shoes without me.

919
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,480
I'd make it a week. Sure.
Really?

920
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,080
What's your
Social Security number?

921
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,320
Five.
Five?

922
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,480
Right.
Right.

923
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,880
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

924
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,160
The other eight? So I
got you for the other eight.

925
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,960
How about a little air?
Yes, I need some air.

926
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,680
That was totally weird.
Totally harmless.

927
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,560
It was totally not
harmless, by the way.

928
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,136
We're dancing.
No one's even watching.

929
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,960
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

930
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:49,200
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

931
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:52,680
No, it was not just a dance. You
don't understand because you're you.

932
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,560
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

933
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,880
and how you are with girls and
all of that, which is completely fine.

934
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,360
But, you know,
then me, you're my boss,

935
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,456
and I'm dancing with you. I
don't think it was taken that way.

936
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,360
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

937
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,376
I just think you're overstating
it. You know, and we're here,

938
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,240
and then I'm wearing
this ridiculous

939
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:15,080
dress, and then we were
dancing like that and...

940
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,920
I would like a drink, please.
Got it, okay.

941
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:36,200
I would like a vodka
martini, please. Okay.

942
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:40,960
Very dry with olives, a lot of
olives. Like, at least three olives.

943
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,920
Two vodka martinis, extra
dry, extra olives, extra fast.

944
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,120
Make one of them dirty,
will you?

945
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,400
Wow. Tony Stark.

946
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,080
Oh, hey.
Fancy seeing you here.

947
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,120
Carrie.
Christine.

948
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,200
That's right.

949
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,960
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

950
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,456
Can I at least get
a reaction from you?

951
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,960
Panic. I would say
panic is my reaction.

952
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,416
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

953
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,840
involvement in
this latest atrocity.

954
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,216
Yeah. They just put my name
on the invitation.

955
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,440
I don't know what to tell you.

956
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,920
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

957
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,440
I was out of town for a couple
months, in case you didn't hear.

958
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,800
Is this what you
call accountability?

959
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,600
It's a town called
Gulmira. Heard of it?

960
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,320
When were these taken?

961
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,560
Yesterday.

962
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,136
I didn't approve any shipment.
Well, your company did.

963
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,120
Well, I'm not my company.

964
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,440
Please, do you mind?

965
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,480
Have you seen
these pictures? Huh?

966
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,976
What's going on in Gulmira?
Tony, Tony.

967
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,480
You can't afford
to be this naive.

968
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,320
You know what?
I was naive before,

969
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,096
when they said, "Here's
the line. We don't cross it.

970
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,720
"This is how
we do business."

971
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,000
If we're double-dealing
under the table... Are we?

972
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,560
Tony,
your picture, please!

973
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,320
Let's take a picture.
Come on. Picture time!

974
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,200
Tony. Who do you think
locked you out?

975
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,200
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

976
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,360
It was the only way
I could protect you.

977
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,040
No. No.

978
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:38,320
The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described

979
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:42,080
as a descent into hell, into a
modern day Heart of Darkness.

980
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,200
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages

981
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,000
have been driven
from their homes,

982
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,160
displaced from their lands
by warlords

983
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,320
emboldened by a new-found power.

984
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,680
Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings

985
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,560
they can find in the ruins
of other villages,

986
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,480
or here in the remnants of
an old Soviet smelting plant.

987
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,640
Recent violence has been
attributed to a group of foreign fighters

988
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,440
referred to by locals
as the Ten Rings.

989
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,080
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.

990
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:20,240
A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.

991
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,040
With no political will
or international pressure,

992
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,600
there's very little hope
for these refugees.

993
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,920
Around me, a woman begging
for news on her husband,

994
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,800
who was kidnapped by insurgents,

995
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,440
either forced to
join their militia...

996
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:37,120
Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,

997
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,760
holding them up to anyone
who will stop.

998
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,440
A child's simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?"

999
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,480
There's very little hope
for these refugees,

1000
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:51,440
refugees who can only
wonder who, if anyone, will help.

1001
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,520
HURRY IT UP.

1002
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:27,696
PUT THE WOMEN IN THE TRUCKS.

1003
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,760
STACK THE WEAPONS HERE.

1004
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:29,880
CLEAR ALL THE HOUSES.

1005
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:30,680
THAT ONE THERE.

1006
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:31,760
FASTER. FASTER.

1007
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,360
GRAB THAT DOG.

1008
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,280
PUT HIM WITH THE OTHERS.

1009
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,600
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

1010
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,000
SHOOT THIS DOG.

1011
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,880
YOU'RE ALL INCOMPETENT.

1012
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,120
TURN YOUR HEAD!

1013
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,400
He's all yours.

1014
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,856
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

1015
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,976
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE,
CALIFORNIA

1016
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,456
No, they were using human
shields. We never got the green light.

1017
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,656
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

1018
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:31,920
Get those monitors up!

1019
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,360
We got a bogey!

1020
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,560
Wasn't Air Force!
We got the CIA on the line?

1021
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,656
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

1022
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,360
No, it definitely
is not us, sir!

1023
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,120
It wasn't Navy.
Wasn't Marines.

1024
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,680
I need answers! Can I
please get eyes on target?

1025
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,040
- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

1026
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,760
Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

1027
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,320
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

1028
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,120
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

1029
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,440
Any high altitude
surveillance in the region?

1030
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,256
We got an AWAC and a
Global Hawk in the area.

1031
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,960
So this thing just
appeared out of nowhere?

1032
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,456
How come it didn't
show up on the radar?

1033
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,480
Got a minimal radar
cross-section, sir.

1034
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,720
Is it stealth?
No, sir, it's tiny.

1035
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,200
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

1036
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,120
Colonel, what are
we dealing with here?

1037
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,600
Let me make a call.
Sergeant, clear a hole.

1038
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,960
Hello?
Tony?

1039
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,800
Who's this?
It's Rhodes.

1040
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,120
Sorry, hello?
I said it's Rhodes.

1041
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:33,080
Speak up, please. What
in the hell is that noise?

1042
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,800
Oh, yeah, I'm driving
with the top down.

1043
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,640
Yeah, well,
I need your help right now.

1044
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,080
It's funny how that works, huh?

1045
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:41,560
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

1046
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,336
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

1047
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,000
Well, that's a hot spot.

1048
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,600
Sounds like someone stepped
in and did your job for you, huh?

1049
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,776
Why do you sound
out of breath, Tony?

1050
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,136
I'm not, I was just
jogging in the canyon.

1051
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,936
I thought you were driving.
Right, I was driving

1052
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,800
to the canyon,
where I'm going to jog.

1053
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,296
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

1054
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,800
- Nope!
- Bogey spotted!

1055
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,176
Whiplash, come in hot.

1056
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,640
Okay, good,
'cause I'm staring at one

1057
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:04,120
right now, and it's about to
be blown to kingdom come.

1058
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,440
That's my exit.

1059
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,320
Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.

1060
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,360
Whiplash One, what is it?

1061
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,800
I've got no idea.

1062
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,936
You have radio contact?

1063
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,200
Non responsive, sir.

1064
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,440
Then you are clear to engage.

1065
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,400
Hit it.

1066
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,240
That bogey just went
supersonic. I got a lock!

1067
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,240
- Inbound missile.
- Flares!

1068
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,840
Wait a second.
Bogey deployed flares!

1069
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,360
Deploy flaps!

1070
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,840
Holy!

1071
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,520
That thing just
jumped off the radar, sir.

1072
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,120
The sat visual has been lost.

1073
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,880
No way that's a UAV.

1074
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,120
What is it?

1075
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,760
I can't see anything.

1076
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,320
Whatever it was,
it just bought the farm.

1077
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,400
I think bogey's
been handled, sir.

1078
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,480
- Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

1079
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,240
It's who?
I'm sorry, it is me.

1080
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,656
You asked. What you
were asking about is me.

1081
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,200
No, see, this isn't a game.

1082
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:34,560
You do not send civilian
equipment into my active war zone.

1083
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,656
You understand that? This
is not a piece of equipment.

1084
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,440
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

1085
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,960
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

1086
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,816
Mark your
position and return to base.

1087
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,480
Roger that, Ballroom.

1088
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,920
On your belly!

1089
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,880
It looks like a man!

1090
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,760
Shake him off!
Roll! Roll!

1091
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:03,920
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1092
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,320
It's confirmed.
He has been hit.

1093
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,440
Punch out! Punch out!

1094
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,640
Whiplash One down.

1095
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,280
Whiplash Two,
do you see a chute?

1096
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,640
Negative! No chute, no chute!

1097
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,520
My chute's jammed!

1098
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,880
Sir, I've got
a visual on the bogey.

1099
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,600
Whiplash Two, reengage. If
you get a clear shot, you take it.

1100
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,016
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

1101
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,160
Call off the Raptors. That
thing just took out an F-22

1102
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,560
inside a legal no fly zone!

1103
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,000
Whiplash Two, if you have
a clear shot, take it!

1104
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,440
You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.

1105
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,880
Keep going!

1106
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,520
Good chute! Good chute!

1107
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,840
Tony, you still there?

1108
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,000
Hey, thanks.

1109
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,680
Oh, my God,
you crazy son of a bitch.

1110
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,936
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

1111
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,160
Yeah, well,
technically, he hit me.

1112
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,816
Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?

1113
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,760
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

1114
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:32,496
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1115
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,080
Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?

1116
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,880
It's not that simple.

1117
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,520
An unfortunate training exercise

1118
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,480
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

1119
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,640
I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

1120
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,640
As for the unexpected turn of
events on the ground in Gulmira,

1121
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:54,200
it is still unclear
who or what intervened,

1122
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:58,440
but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.

1123
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,560
Hey!

1124
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:05,360
It is a tight fit, sir.

1125
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:09,240
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.

1126
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:11,240
Be gentle.
This is my first time.

1127
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,560
I designed this to
come off, so...

1128
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,000
Hey.

1129
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:18,520
I really should be able to...

1130
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,280
Please,
try not to move, sir.

1131
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,840
What's going on here?

1132
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:32,440
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

1133
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,880
Are those bullet holes?

1134
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,600
Welcome.

1135
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,040
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1136
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13,640
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

1137
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,800
You paid us trinkets
to kill a prince.

1138
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,640
Show me the weapon.

1139
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,360
Come. Leave your
guards outside.

1140
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,680
His escape bore
unexpected fruit.

1141
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,320
So this is how he did it.

1142
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:49,160
This is only a first,
crude effort.

1143
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:51,680
Stark has perfected his design.

1144
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,600
He has made
a masterpiece of death.

1145
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:58,440
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1146
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,360
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1147
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,400
We have a common enemy.

1148
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,680
If we are still in business,

1149
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,400
I will give you these designs

1150
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:19,920
as a gift.

1151
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,000
And in turn,

1152
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:29,760
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1153
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,800
THIS IS THE ONLY GIFT
YOU SHALL RECEIVE.

1154
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,080
Technology.

1155
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,480
It's always been your Achilles'
heel in this part of the world.

1156
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:57,840
Don't worry. It'll only
last for 15 minutes.

1157
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,480
That's the least
of your problems.

1158
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,360
Crate up the armor
and the rest of it.

1159
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,040
All right, let's finish up here.

1160
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,920
Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

1161
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,720
and I'm going to
want this data masked.

1162
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,560
Recruit our top engineers.

1163
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,520
I want a prototype right away.

1164
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:36,840
Hey. You busy? You mind
if I send you on an errand?

1165
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,160
I need you to go to my office.

1166
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:42,136
You're going to hack into the
mainframe and you're going to retrieve all

1167
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:44,800
the recent shipping
manifests. This is a lock chip.

1168
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,440
This'll get you in.

1169
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,120
It's probably
under Executive Files.

1170
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,640
If not, they put it on a ghost
drive, in which case you need

1171
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:53,360
to look for the lowest
numeric heading.

1172
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,176
And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?

1173
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,280
Same drill.

1174
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,456
They've been dealing under the
table, and I'm going to stop them.

1175
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:02,560
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1176
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:04,560
Tony,

1177
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,760
you know that I would
help you with anything,

1178
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,800
but I cannot help you if you're
going to start all of this again.

1179
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:16,480
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1180
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:20,000
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1181
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,160
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1182
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,720
Is that so?

1183
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,400
Well, then, I quit.

1184
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,120
You stood by my side
all these years

1185
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:38,000
while I reaped the
benefits of destruction.

1186
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,160
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1187
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,136
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1188
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,680
You're going to
kill yourself, Tony.

1189
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,640
I'm not going
to be a part of it.

1190
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,680
I shouldn't be alive,

1191
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,160
unless it was for a reason.

1192
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,840
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1193
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:58,520
I just finally know
what I have to do.

1194
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,640
And I know in my heart
that it's right.

1195
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,800
You're all I have,
too, you know.

1196
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:38,160
Sector 16? What are
you up to, Obadiah?

1197
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:55,440
You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.

1198
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,096
As you can see, Obadiah
Stane... Oh, my God.

1199
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,840
...your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.

1200
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,640
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.

1201
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:11,040
So, what are we
going to do about this?

1202
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:14,720
Hmm?

1203
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,320
I know what you're
going through, Pepper.

1204
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,720
Tony. He always gets
the good stuff, doesn't he?

1205
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:03,760
I was so happy
when he came home.

1206
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,640
It was like we got him
back from the dead.

1207
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,640
Now I realize,

1208
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,200
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1209
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:21,640
He left a part of
himself in that cave.

1210
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,000
Breaks my heart.

1211
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:32,280
Well, he's a complicated person.

1212
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,400
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1213
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:47,440
You are a very rare woman.

1214
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:52,120
Tony doesn't know
how lucky he is.

1215
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,880
Thank you. Thanks.

1216
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,920
I'd better get back there.

1217
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,440
Is that today's paper?

1218
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,120
Yes.

1219
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,280
Do you mind?

1220
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,720
Not at all.
Puzzle.

1221
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,120
Of course.

1222
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,960
Take care.

1223
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,840
Ms. Potts?
We had an appointment.

1224
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,056
Did you forget
about our appointment?

1225
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,600
Nope, right now.
Come with me.

1226
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,816
Right now? We're
going to have it right now.

1227
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,640
Yeah, walk with me.
Okay.

1228
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,160
I'm going to give you the
meeting of your life. Your office.

1229
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,400
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1230
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:05,320
Absolutely, we're... I'm
going to have to call you back.

1231
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:08,200
Mr. Stane?
Sir, we've explored

1232
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,616
what you've asked us, and it
seems as though there's a little hiccup.

1233
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:12,320
Actually...
A hiccup?

1234
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:16,200
Yes, to power the suit, sir, the
technology actually doesn't exist.

1235
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:19,600
So it's... Wait, wait,
wait. The technology?

1236
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:22,600
William, here is the technology.

1237
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,680
I've asked you to
simply make it smaller.

1238
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:29,720
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

1239
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:36,400
Tony Stark was able to build
this in a cave! With a box of scraps!

1240
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,680
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not Tony Stark.

1241
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,880
Tony?

1242
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:04,840
Tony, are you there?
Hello?

1243
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,640
Breathe.

1244
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:11,560
Easy, easy.

1245
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,920
You remember this one, right?

1246
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,960
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1247
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:24,160
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

1248
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:27,400
Ah, Tony.

1249
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:34,400
When I ordered the hit on you,

1250
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,560
I worried that I was

1251
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,600
killing the golden goose.

1252
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:49,680
But, you see, it was just

1253
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,320
Fate that you survived that.

1254
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:02,280
You had one last
golden egg to give.

1255
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:11,760
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1256
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:20,800
Your father, he helped
give us the atomic bomb.

1257
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:25,120
Now, what kind of world would it
be today if he was as selfish as you?

1258
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:36,760
Oh, it's beautiful.

1259
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:44,200
Oh, Tony, this is
your Ninth Symphony.

1260
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,520
Ah. What a masterpiece.
Look at that.

1261
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,120
This is your legacy.

1262
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:59,840
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1263
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:06,800
Weapons that will help steer
the world back on course,

1264
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:09,120
put the balance of
power in our hands.

1265
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:12,360
The right hands.

1266
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:20,040
I wish you could
see my prototype.

1267
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:22,880
It's not as...

1268
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:27,240
Well, not as
conservative as yours.

1269
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:32,120
Too bad you had to
involve Pepper in this.

1270
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,160
I would have preferred
that she lived.

1271
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,480
What do you mean, he
paid to have Tony killed?

1272
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,200
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1273
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:55,720
Okay, where's Tony now?

1274
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,520
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1275
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:59,720
Please go over there and
make sure everything's okay.

1276
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,400
Thank you, Rhodey.
I know a shortcut.

1277
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,040
Good boy.

1278
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:50,960
Tony?

1279
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:54,680
Tony?

1280
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,600
Tony?

1281
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:00,840
Tony?

1282
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,600
Tony!

1283
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,080
Tony! You okay?

1284
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,160
Where's Pepper?

1285
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:13,080
She's fine.
She's with five agents.

1286
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:15,480
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1287
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,680
That's not going to be enough.

1288
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:47,560
Section 16. Section
16. There it is.

1289
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:59,240
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1290
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,480
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1291
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,056
It's, like, a thing that's
going to pick the lock?

1292
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:05,800
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1293
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,920
That's the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

1294
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:29,760
Not bad, huh?
Let's do it.

1295
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:38,840
You need me to do anything else?

1296
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,240
Keep the skies clear.

1297
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,640
Damn!

1298
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,360
Next time, baby.

1299
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:30,840
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1300
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,440
I thought it'd be bigger.

1301
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,400
Take him out!

1302
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,216
How do you think the Mark I
chest piece is going to hold up?

1303
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,560
The suit's at 48%
power and falling, sir.

1304
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:37,360
That chest piece was never
designed for sustained flight.

1305
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:38,960
Keep me posted.

1306
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:41,759
Pepper!

1307
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,280
Tony! Tony,
are you okay?

1308
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:44,840
I'm fine.
How are...

1309
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:46,840
Obadiah, he's gone insane!
I know.

1310
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:48,736
Listen, you'd better get
out of there. He built a suit.

1311
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,240
Get out of there right now!

1312
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,440
Where do you think you're going?

1313
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,920
Your services are
no longer required.

1314
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:14,600
Stane!

1315
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,480
I love this suit!

1316
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:42,640
Put them down!

1317
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:44,680
Collateral damage, Tony.

1318
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,400
Divert power to chest RT.

1319
01:45:57,120 --> 01:45:59,240
Power reduced to 19%.

1320
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:08,160
Lady!

1321
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:12,120
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1322
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:37,160
For 30 years,
I've been holding you up!

1323
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:44,040
I built this company
from nothing!

1324
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,880
Nothing is going
to stand in my way.

1325
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,520
Least of all you!

1326
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:10,400
Impressive! You've
upgraded your armor!

1327
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:13,680
I've made some
upgrades of my own!

1328
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,000
Sir, it appears
that his suit can fly.

1329
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,720
Duly noted. Take me
to maximum altitude.

1330
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,120
With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...

1331
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,360
I know the math! Do it!

1332
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:40,960
Sir, you're not going to
believe this. That thing is back.

1333
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,680
Get me Major Allen.
Scramble the jets!

1334
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:49,400
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1335
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,720
Yes, sir.

1336
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:00,600
Thirteen
percent power, sir. Climb!

1337
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,600
Eleven percent.
Keep going!

1338
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,480
Seven percent power.
Just leave it on the screen!

1339
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:17,160
Stop telling me!

1340
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:31,480
You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!

1341
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,080
How'd you solve
the icing problem?

1342
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:35,640
Icing problem?

1343
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:40,240
Might want to look into it.

1344
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:53,200
Two percent.

1345
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:57,840
We are now running
on emergency backup power.

1346
01:48:57,920 --> 01:48:58,920
Whoa!

1347
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:13,360
Potts! Tony! Oh, my
God, are you okay?

1348
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:17,560
I'm almost out of power. I've got to
get out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1349
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,000
Nice try!

1350
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:33,440
Weapons status?

1351
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,760
Repulsors
offline. Missiles offline.

1352
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,520
Flares!

1353
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,120
Very clever, Tony.

1354
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,920
Potts?
Tony!

1355
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
This isn't working.

1356
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,416
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1357
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:04,880
Well, how are you
going to do that?

1358
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,360
You're going to do it.

1359
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,880
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1360
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,416
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1361
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:13,080
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1362
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:14,560
It's going to fry
everything up here.

1363
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:19,000
Okay. I'm going in now.

1364
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:22,320
Make sure you wait till I clear
the roof. I'll buy you some time.

1365
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,640
This looks important!

1366
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:57,320
I never had a taste
for this sort of thing,

1367
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:01,520
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1368
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:12,280
You finally
outdid yourself, Tony!

1369
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:16,800
You'd have made
your father proud!

1370
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:24,280
It's ready, Tony!
Get off the roof!

1371
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,120
Tony!

1372
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:47,960
How ironic, Tony!

1373
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,120
Trying to rid
the world of weapons,

1374
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,840
you gave it its best one ever!

1375
01:51:54,880 --> 01:52:00,800
Pepper! And now I'm
going to kill you with it!

1376
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,160
You ripped out my
targeting system!

1377
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,680
Time to hit the button!

1378
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,680
You told me not to!

1379
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,760
Hold still, you little prick!

1380
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:15,080
Just do it!

1381
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,360
You'll die!

1382
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:21,000
Push it!

1383
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:20,320
Tony!

1384
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:30,896
You've all received the official
statement of what occurred

1385
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:33,280
at Stark Industries last night.

1386
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:38,120
There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

1387
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:40,800
and caused damage
to the arc reactor.

1388
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:43,896
Fortunately, a member of Tony
Stark's personal security staff...

1389
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,896
"Iron Man." That's kind of
catchy. It's got a nice ring to it.

1390
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,400
I mean, it's not
technically accurate.

1391
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,599
The suit's
a gold-titanium alloy,

1392
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:52,280
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1393
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:54,000
Here's your alibi.

1394
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:55,960
Okay.

1395
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:58,200
You were on your yacht.
Yeah.

1396
01:53:58,280 --> 01:54:00,440
We have port papers that
put you in Avalon all night,

1397
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:02,200
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1398
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:05,440
See, I was thinking maybe we
should say it was just Pepper and me

1399
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:07,320
alone on the island.

1400
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:09,880
That's what happened.
All right.

1401
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:12,080
Just read it, word for word.

1402
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:16,000
There's nothing
about Stane here.

1403
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:18,880
That's being handled.
He's on vacation.

1404
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,240
Small aircraft have such
a poor safety record.

1405
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:24,800
But what about the whole
cover story that it's a bodyguard?

1406
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:27,840
He's my... I mean, is that... That's
kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1407
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:30,200
This isn't my first
rodeo, Mr. Stark.

1408
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,656
Just stick to
the official statement,

1409
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:34,280
and soon, this will
all be behind you.

1410
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:36,640
You've got 90 seconds.

1411
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:40,760
Oh, Agent Coulson?

1412
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:46,360
I just wanted to say thank you
very much for all of your help.

1413
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:49,360
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1414
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:51,200
From the Strategic Homeland...

1415
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:52,880
Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1416
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:54,480
Right.

1417
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:56,960
Let's get this show on the road.

1418
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:59,360
You know, it's
actually not that bad.

1419
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:01,680
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1420
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,360
You're not Iron Man.
Am so.

1421
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,920
You're not. All
right, suit yourself.

1422
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,000
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1423
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:11,536
She'd be a wreck, 'cause
she'd always be worrying

1424
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:12,640
that I was going to die,

1425
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:15,080
yet so proud of
the man I'd become.

1426
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:18,880
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1427
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:21,680
Crazy about me.

1428
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:23,440
Tell me you never
think about that night.

1429
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,400
What night?
You know.

1430
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:34,040
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1431
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:41,320
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1432
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:44,640
and you left me there,
by myself?

1433
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:48,400
Is that the night
you're talking about?

1434
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,480
Mmm-hmm.

1435
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:51,680
Thought so.

1436
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:58,120
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1437
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:01,760
And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

1438
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:04,880
He will not be taking
any questions. Thank you.

1439
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,440
Been a while since
I was in front of you.

1440
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:13,096
I figure I'll stick
to the cards this time.

1441
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:19,200
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

1442
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,560
on the freeway
and the rooftop...

1443
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:23,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1444
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:27,280
that was a bodyguard in a
suit that conveniently appeared,

1445
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:30,440
despite the fact that you...
I know that it's confusing.

1446
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:34,160
It is one thing to question the
official story, and another thing entirely

1447
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:37,480
to make wild accusations, or
insinuate that I'm a superhero.

1448
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:39,200
I never said
you were a superhero.

1449
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:40,280
Didn't?
Mmm-mmm.

1450
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:44,640
Well, good, because that
would be outlandish and fantastic.

1451
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:49,880
I'm just not the
hero type. Clearly.

1452
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:53,480
With this laundry list
of character defects,

1453
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:54,920
all the mistakes I've made,

1454
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:56,600
largely public.

1455
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:58,360
Just stick to
the cards, man.

1456
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:00,080
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1457
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:03,720
The truth is.

1458
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:11,360
I am Iron Man.

1459
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:15,880
Jarvis!

1460
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:17,680
Welcome home, sir.

1461
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:26,640
"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

1462
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,240
Mr. Stark, you've become
part of a bigger universe.

1463
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:32,120
You just don't know it yet.

1464
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:34,360
Who the hell are you?

1465
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:37,320
Nick Fury,
Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1466
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:39,160
Ah.

1467
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:42,360
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.
