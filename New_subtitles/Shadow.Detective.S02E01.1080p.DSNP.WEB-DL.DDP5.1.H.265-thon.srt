If Mr. Kim Taekrok isn't here,

The third time's the charm.
If you still didn't, you won't ever.

19
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,170
This is why I told you
to prepare for reinstatement.

20
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,760
Hey, that hurts.

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,100
Darn it.

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,640
Just go and unclog the drain.

23
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,680
You're the manager. Go and act like one.

24
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,270
Fine. It always gets clogged.

25
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,270
Can you use an excavator to unclog...

was the only one who faced charges.

34
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,800
That means large-scale acts of corruption

SHADOW DETECTIVE SEASON 2

40
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,560
This is awful.
How can I go about living like this?

41
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,810
We'll make sure to catch the thief.

42
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,890
For now, come this way.

43
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,940
Take the victim to the station, please.

44
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,900
How could this happen?

45
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,820
You think they're the same ones
from the last case?

46
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,860
Yeah.

47
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,200
They didn't even try to open the safe
and just took whatever they could find.

48
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,580
They're bold, but it doesn't seem
like they're professionals.

49
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,420
Judging by the footprint,
it should be around 230 to 240 mm.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,800
Could they be women?
Or they could be kids.

51
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,920
Or both.

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,010
If they really are minors,
should we call Women and Juvenile Affairs?

53
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,970
Let's do a bit more digging.
This was filed with us, after all.

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,770
Okay.

55
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,310
Jeez. This has been
going on for over a year now.

56
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,400
The town's getting depressed.

57
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,450
Taekrok should be there
when we get back, right?

58
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,910
Probably.

59
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,040
It's already been a year and a half.

60
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,960
By the way, Detective Han...

61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,210
"Team Leader Han."

62
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,340
All right. "Team Leader Han."

63
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,050
Look at him.

64
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,670
It doesn't make sense.

65
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,930
He definitely smells fishy
but doesn't get investigated.

66
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,300
He even buttered up the new chief
and got himself a promotion.

67
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,060
On the other hand,
Taekrok was pressured to go on leave.

68
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,680
Does that make sense to you?

69
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,810
Let's just think of it
as him taking a break.

70
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,980
But still.

71
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,730
He was studying how to operate excavators.

72
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,190
That didn't feel right to me.

73
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,110
He should be on the scene
as a homicide detective.

74
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,500
- Women and Juvenile Affairs?
-Yes.

75
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,170
You'll be joining the Women
and Juvenile Affairs Investigation Team.

76
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,250
BAEK SEONGIL

77
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,750
Are you surprised?

78
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,300
Yes, well...

79
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,800
It's not like I have a say in the matter.

80
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,050
I've read your employment history,
and it seems you've been through a lot

81
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,060
in the Homicide and
Special Crimes Investigation Unit.

82
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,930
You should end your career
more comfortably.

83
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,400
I mean, Women and Juvenile Affairs
could be difficult in other ways.

84
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,900
But at least you won't be
getting stabbed or shot at.

85
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,320
Well, sounds good.

86
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,910
And it should be good
for performance evaluations,

87
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,950
so it might help you get promoted.

88
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,330
You should at least be a captain
before you retire.

89
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,790
It would make your juniors
and I feel at ease.

90
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,090
Is that the only reason?

91
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,180
Should there be other reasons?

92
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,260
Right.

93
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,900
Detective Kim.

94
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,900
Sincere congratulations on your return.

95
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,630
AFTER GEUMO'S CORRUPTION SCANDAL...
REDEVELOPMENT REMAINS A PROBLEM

96
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,630
What do you mean
there's no vacancy for Taekrok?

97
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,130
I know. I was shocked too.

98
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,510
But it's not like I can go to HR
and cause a scene.

99
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,810
We're losing a team member
since we're powerless.

100
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,200
WOMEN AND JUVENILE AFFAIRS
INVESTIGATION TEAM

101
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,450
We really didn't take her money!

102
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,250
Why don't you believe us?

103
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,960
Lying isn't going to help you.

104
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,010
Are you a parent?

105
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,430
Where's your team leader?

106
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,930
- I'm sorry.
-All right. Now, get out of here.

107
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,400
She's not here at the moment.

108
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,400
- Taekrok!
- Lieutenant Ham. Look at you.

109
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,360
I'm having a baby.

110
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,740
The team leader is on a business trip,
so you'll see her tomorrow.

111
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,910
Do you know her?

112
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,580
No, I don't.

113
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,580
I guess it's because she was assigned
while you were on leave.

114
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,620
She's from the police academy
and is pretty good.

115
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,620
Follow me.

116
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,800
This will be your desk for now,

117
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,720
and once I go on maternity leave,
you'll have all this space to yourself.

118
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,890
About our team leader.

119
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,230
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You remember the mass assault case</i></font>

120
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,390
<i><font color="#80FFFF">of a mentally handicapped high school
student in Seoul five years ago?</i></font>

121
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,570
<i><font color="#80FFFF">She dug into the case for over three years
until the perpetrators became adults.</i></font>

122
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,030
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Apparently, she even received
death threats from the parents.</i></font>

123
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,450
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But she didn't stop, and in the end,
they all got prison sentences.</i></font>

124
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,990
<i><font color="#80FFFF">She's super tenacious.</i></font>

125
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,160
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But...</i></font>

126
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,080
But what? What's wrong?

127
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,790
I'm worried that
you two might not get along.

128
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,670
She's the exact opposite of you.

129
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,680
She hates breaking rules and procedures.

130
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,890
I hate that too!

131
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,680
Oh...

132
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,520
Looks like you've gotten
quite shameless with age.

133
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,060
But how did you end up here?

134
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,900
This is quite a huge leap from Homicide.

135
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,730
Things are completely different here.

136
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,820
- Different how?
- You need more brain than brawn,

137
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,580
more heart than muscle.
That's what you'll need the most.

138
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,660
Just make it simple.

139
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,830
So...

140
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,410
- She means you have to hold it in.
- My gosh.

141
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,160
To put it simply,
you've got to have a "service mentality."

142
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,250
Gosh, you know this well.

143
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,670
But who...

144
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,960
Hello.

145
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,590
I'm new here to the Women
and Juvenile Affairs Investigation Team.

146
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,840
I'm Officer Gong Haneul!

147
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,680
Oh, you're Taekrok's partner.

148
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,140
-Hey, what...
- He looks reliable. Right, sir?

149
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,350
FOR THE SAFETY AND HAPPINESS OF CITIZENS

150
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,440
Are you going to start smoking again?

151
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,070
That's so harsh. You just got back.

152
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,200
Are you really joining
Women and Juveniles?

153
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,450
Why don't you talk to the chief again?

154
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,500
It's fine. Who cares where I spend...

155
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,670
my last years?

156
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,130
Oh.

157
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,890
That's Detective Choi Dohyung, right?

158
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,890
Yeah, it is.

159
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,930
I heard he was moving
to Geumo after retirement. So it was true.

160
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,940
Uh, the Seoul Investigation Unit...

161
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,270
Or was it the Mobile Investigation Unit
back then?

162
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,940
Weren't you on the same team then?

163
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,820
Really? Were you close?

164
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,950
- Ooh.
- See ya.

165
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,740
He doesn't brag, does he?

166
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,660
He's not like you.

167
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,210
It's weird he doesn't talk
about his time in the MIU.

168
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,750
I think that's all you should know.

169
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,420
- Then, I'll put that in the record.
-Yes.

170
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,340
Let me ask you the next question.

171
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,840
The book that you wrote
about the Eunsan serial murder

172
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,890
was made into a movie,
which was a huge success.

173
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,600
You must be so proud of it.

174
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,230
On the contrary.

175
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,860
- What?
- The fact that the movie was a success

176
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,780
means that a lot of people still live
in fear of violent crimes.

177
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,700
Since I was in the forces myself,
I'm not proud. I'm ashamed.

178
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,490
And that must be why you set up

179
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,750
a welfare foundation
in your hometown of Geumo.

180
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,710
That's very admirable.

181
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,040
- Right.
- Yes.

182
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,420
Admirable, my foot...

183
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,460
Why are you even writing that down?

184
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,840
Don't put any grand reason behind it.

185
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,720
It's only right that I give back the money
I made by selling victims' stories.

186
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,600
I just noticed that
the detective is very shy.

187
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,890
I think you're right.

188
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,980
For goodness' sake.

189
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,900
Go ahead and ask him.

190
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,900
- So this next question is for you, Chief.
- Sure.

191
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,150
Geumo Police
promised to offer full support

192
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,740
for the foundation
Detective Choi Dohyung established.

193
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,780
Tell us about it.

194
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,700
I was deeply impressed
by the detective's noble cause,

195
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,170
but, most of all, it was
to make it up to the citizens

196
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,040
who would have been disappointed
with Geumo Police

197
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,130
regarding recent incidents.

198
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,970
Make sure to write this down
and put it in the article later.

199
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,090
So he won't go back on his words.

200
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,510
All right.

201
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,640
Yes. I'll make sure to write it down.

202
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,140
Goodness, I guess I'm in trouble now.

203
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,900
Hello. Yes, sir. We should go
golfing sometime soon.

204
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,360
I'll make a reservation
at someplace private. Yes.

205
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,610
Take care. Bye.

206
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,870
Hello, Detective Kim.

207
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,330
So how are you adjusting
to Women and Juveniles?

208
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,000
I think it would have been better
if you came to work under me.

209
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,960
I mean, it sounds better
than those kids who don't know anything.

210
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,880
Don't you get tired of living like that?

211
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,850
Excuse me.

212
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,860
Aren't you Detective Choi Dohyung?

213
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,650
You are. My gosh!

214
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,530
It's an honor.

215
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,700
I'm Team Leader Han Giyong,
of Homicide Team One.

216
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,860
I see.

217
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,450
But what brings you here?

218
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,990
Doesn't Detective Kim Taekrok work here?

219
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,040
Yes, but he's been transferred to
the Women and Juvenile Affairs Division.

220
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,870
I ran into him just now.
Do you want me to get him for you?

221
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,630
No, it's all right.

222
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,750
I wanted to see him since I was here.
I'll contact him myself.

223
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,800
Well then...

224
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,010
- Take care, sir.
- Sure.

225
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,640
They know each other?

226
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,980
- Look who's here.
- My.

227
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

228
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,610
- It's nicer than I expected.
- Here you go.

229
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,690
You didn't have to bring anything.

230
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,650
You told us to get this one.

231
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,910
Now it looks like you're settled down.
I hope you get a lot of business.

232
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,070
Thanks. Dear, this is nice.

233
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,490
Hey, I heard Taekrok got assigned
to Women and Juveniles.

234
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,870
Didn't he flip out about that?

235
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,370
He was calm about it, surprisingly.

236
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,830
But I don't get why
he's not doing anything.

237
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,210
He's not the Detective Kim I knew.

238
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,540
Look at this kid.

239
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,010
You only worked with Taek the Dog
for a month, so what do you know?

240
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,260
By the way, I've been curious.
Why do you call him Taek the Dog?

241
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,640
I told you before. He's like a dog.

242
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,970
I know that, but why?

243
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,980
Well, we didn't give him that nickname.

244
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,520
It was the mobs. Because he never
lets things go once he bites.

245
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,730
Now, he's old and weak.

246
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,490
But back in the day, once he got mad,
nobody would be unscathed.

247
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,200
That's what I don't get.

248
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,410
I really considered him my role model.

249
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,200
But now he's in Women and Juveniles,
where he clearly doesn't belong.

250
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,540
Don't you think so?

251
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,460
Come on, he deserves a break.

252
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,500
He'll hit 60 soon.

253
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,840
Retirement's right around the corner,
and he's still out in the field.

254
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,590
And I'm just out of words when I see him.

255
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,260
He spent 30 years in the force, get it?

256
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,680
But then after what happened to Jiu,
he got panic anxiety.

257
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,180
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Still, he managed to keep himself
going, with meds and a strong will.</i></font>

258
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,520
So I thought he'd be fine
until retirement.

259
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,850
Then, that entire mess happened last year.

260
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,320
-What do you want?
-<i><font color="#80FFFF">To play a game.</i></font>

261
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
What kind of game?

262
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,690
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It's very simple.</i></font>

263
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,030
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Look back on your past.</i></font>

264
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,240
Hyeonseok!

265
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,670
<i><font color="#80FFFF">This game will not end
until one of us dies.</i></font>

266
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,970
No.

267
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,430
No. Hey...

268
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,760
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And after all that happened to him,</i></font>

269
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,140
there's no way he'd be fine,
not even for Taek the Dog.

270
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,020
I mean, I think I'm actually impressed
that he even came back to the force.

271
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,990
- We should get going.
- Why? Let's have some of this together.

272
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,030
We'll be back.

273
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,360
We have places to investigate.

274
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,030
You know, there are a lot of thefts
these days. So take care.

275
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,990
All right, thanks.

276
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,580
You take care of the old man, okay?

277
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,000
Of course. We'll see you.

278
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,660
Bye.

279
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,420
Detective Kim! I mean, Taekrok.

280
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,210
Let's go get some <i><font color="#80FFFF">gukbap</i></font>.

281
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,710
-I'm busy.
- Where are you off to?

282
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,880
To figure out what to do after I retire.

283
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,180
- Excuse me?
- I should find myself a place

284
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,840
and move out of that studio like you did.

285
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,930
But I miss that place.

286
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,100
I'll see you tomorrow, sir!

287
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,790
24-HOUR PATROL AND CCTV
FOR CRIME PREVENTION

288
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,350
You think we'll find anything?

289
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,150
What was that?

290
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,570
It looks like someone went inside.
Stop the car.

291
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,370
Hey, remember what happened yesterday?

292
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,040
Hey, the kid's here.

293
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,710
Hey.

294
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,800
- This is it?
- He said he was being generous.

295
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,180
You sure he wasn't lying?

296
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,020
- You can usually tell right away.
- He wasn't.

297
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,560
Fucking shit.

298
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,810
Should we find new dealers?

299
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,620
What?

300
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,290
Over there.

301
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,920
Should I call for backup?

302
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,670
They're kids. Why would we need backup?

303
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,090
Kids these days are scary. Wait...

304
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,050
You're not the least bit careful.

305
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,730
Looks like there are five or six.

306
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,400
No doubt they're minors.

307
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,480
They must be some sort of
runaway family or something.

308
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,820
What's that?

309
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,410
What the fuck?

310
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,300
Hey kids, that's dangerous. Put that down.

311
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,630
- Who are you?
- We're police.

312
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,970
What are you doing here?

313
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,600
Hana, get ready to run.

314
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,020
Bullshit.

315
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,390
Run!

316
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,520
Hey, you all right?

317
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,110
I told you we should've called backup!

318
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,110
Don't be so dramatic.
Go get them. Come on.

319
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,240
Hey!

320
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,460
Hey!

321
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,170
Damn it.

322
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,000
Hurry up, dumbass!

323
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,440
Hey, this way.

324
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,470
Fuck.

325
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,260
Split up!

326
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,680
Shit.

327
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,440
I ran a background check on the girl.

328
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,940
What, she's a minor?

329
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,070
So she ran away from home.

330
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,620
Why keep a kid like her
in the interrogation room?

331
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,660
You could've given her a warning
and sent her home.

332
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,040
She's likely involved in the serial theft
that's been going on recently.

333
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,830
Plus she was in a dangerous environment.

334
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,960
Do you know how many people
we have to call here

335
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,840
to investigate a kid for a criminal case?
Parents, social workers...

336
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,000
Just send her home and tell her
to come back tomorrow.

337
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,130
Never mind. Just hand her over
to Women and Juveniles here.

338
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,720
We have a detective right here.

339
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,140
Hand her over to him.

340
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,600
What an ass.

341
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,940
What should we do?

342
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,820
Didn't you hear
what your team leader said?

343
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,110
Send her home.

344
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,740
You should have seen
the situation yourself.

345
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,240
So let's send her home safely.

346
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,630
Why did you run away from home?

347
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,010
What's it to you, lady?

348
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,150
Hana was in a dangerous situation.

349
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,570
Please take good care of her.

350
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,230
All right.

351
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,240
Hey, come on.

352
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,330
Hana.

353
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,750
What?

354
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,340
This is my contact info.

355
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,090
LEE SEONGA, HOMICIDE TEAM 1
GEUMO POLICE STATION

356
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,180
Call me if you need to.

357
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,530
Hey.

358
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,740
I would rather die than get help from you.

359
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,410
Then live a proper life, kid!

360
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,370
It doesn't make sense for you
to quit school to make money.

361
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,660
What on earth will you become?

362
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,960
So you're acting like my dad
after you put him in prison.

363
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,050
Don't you think that's funny?

364
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,590
What else would a criminal's kid become?

365
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,640
I'd probably end up the same way.

366
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,640
Hey, Seonga.

367
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,560
Lee Seonga!

368
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,650
What were you doing there?

369
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,610
I went by a real estate agency.

370
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,780
I'm looking into getting a small apartment
with my retirement pension.

371
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,120
I can't keep living in a studio.

372
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,580
Is that why you didn't see me once
while on leave?

373
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,630
You were busy planning your retirement?

374
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,510
About Hana.

375
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,180
I'm going to keep an eye on her,
so please do the same at Juvenile Affairs.

376
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,010
Why do you care so much?

377
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,470
You don't have to do all that.

378
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,230
So why did you care so much about me?

379
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,340
You saw the cop jump off, right?

380
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,970
-It was just...
- He's a damn lunatic.

381
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,340
I totally freaked out. He jumped...

382
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,090
- Stop playing.
- You're joking.

383
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,680
Hey. The cops didn't follow you, did they?

384
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,310
This isn't some movie.

385
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,980
-Coward.
- Hey, are you all right?

386
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,480
Where is it this time?

387
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,480
Over there next to the church.

388
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,740
You know it, right?

389
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,540
Go in past midnight. Not from the front.

390
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:18,760
There. Take the alley
and go through the back door.

391
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,890
- Okay.
- I hope they've got good stuff this time.

392
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,560
I have to get a new phone.
The camera broke.

393
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,270
- Me too.
-I want one too.

394
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,430
-Me first.
-What are you talking about?

395
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,480
There are better things to spend money on.

396
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,100
Let me get one this time.

397
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,610
Feeding your face costs twice
as much as everyone else.

398
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,980
Don't be such a pig.

399
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,780
-Am I the only one who eats?
-You eat up everything.

400
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,410
Shit.

401
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,240
Hey, fatso.

402
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,080
Don't point it at the window, dumbass.

403
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,420
- Anything?
- Nothing.

404
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,460
What about you guys?

405
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
Nothing.

406
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,130
Shit, this is driving me crazy.

407
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,300
Let's get out of here.

408
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,550
- Leave?
- Hurry up.

409
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,260
What are you doing? Hurry up!

410
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,450
Hey. What are you doing? Let's just go.

411
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,660
Hang on.

412
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,590
Hey.

413
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,470
Who the hell are you?

414
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,550
You fucking bastard.

415
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,640
You piece of shit. Fucking prick.

416
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,600
What are you, bastard?

417
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,860
Let's get out of here.

418
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,790
Woo Jangik, that jerk, had to call me
out here in the middle of the night.

419
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,080
Damn.

420
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,920
Hey, Mr. Kim! Grab that kid.

421
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,180
Get him!

422
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,530
You got transferred to Juvenile Affairs.

423
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,540
How did you know that?

424
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,750
Just because I'm stuck here

425
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,920
doesn't mean I've gone deaf or blind.

426
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,170
How much longer will this go on?

427
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,550
What do you mean?

428
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
How long do I have to be
the world's greatest traitor

429
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,770
while you rot away in the background?

430
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,310
The ones who did this to us
are still out there.

431
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,400
Is this all we get
for me turning myself in?

432
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,110
It's been more than a year
since Chairman Jang died.

433
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,240
What have you been doing all this time?

434
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,870
Do I have to do anything?

435
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,420
Let me know if you need anything.

436
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,890
They say the first snow
is coming early this year.

437
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,360
GEUMO DETENTION CENTER

438
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,110
CIVIL AFFAIRS

439
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,050
-Are you not going to tell me?
-It wasn't us.

440
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,260
Like hell it wasn't! You keep
talking back and won't call your parents.

441
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,840
-It wasn't us.
-Stay still. Be quiet!

442
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,060
-You're here.
- Yeah.

443
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,930
- You're here.
- Hey.

444
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,520
They were driving around last night
in a car they stole.

445
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,980
I feel bad since they're kids...

446
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,730
but they're outrageous. What should I do?

447
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,530
What do you mean what should you do?

448
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,690
The good ones always come
to their senses on their own.

449
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,030
And if they don't?

450
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,990
They end up like you.

451
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,370
Ending up like me is a good thing.

452
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,330
Do you think of all crimes like that?

453
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,750
Standing by and watching
rather than educating,

454
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,500
punishment rather than rehabilitation?

455
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,710
Detective Kim, this is our team leader.

456
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,420
Ms. Yeon!

457
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,630
Oh.

458
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,090
This is Detective Kim Taekrok.

459
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,380
I'm Yeon Juhyun.

460
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,930
It's an honor to have someone
so famous on my team.

461
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,770
Famous?

462
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,020
I mean, the Geumo corruption cartel,

463
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,320
a cop killer, and... What's his name?
Chairman Jang?

464
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Although he did kill himself.
Anyway, even the crime broker.

465
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,860
I heard they were all caught,
thanks to you.

466
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,660
Doesn't that make you
the hidden hero of Geumo?

467
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,580
But, Detective Kim.

468
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,790
Whether you're a hero or a villain,

469
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,880
as long as you're working for me,
you can't be late.

470
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,210
If you start breaking
little rules like this,

471
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,760
eventually, you'll go too far.

472
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,560
Yes, well.

473
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,810
I'll keep that in mind.

474
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,400
Then, let's go to your first assignment.

475
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,900
- Come with us.
- Yes, ma'am.

476
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,030
Let's go. Follow me.

477
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,990
School violence!

478
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,490
Let's prevent it!

479
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,830
School violence!

480
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,620
Let's prevent it!

481
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,330
School violence!

482
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,120
Let's prevent it!

483
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,460
School violence!

484
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,250
Let's prevent it!

485
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,380
School violence!

486
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,090
Let's prevent it!
Let's prevent it!

487
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,300
School violence!

488
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,920
Let's prevent it!
Let's prevent it!

489
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,380
School violence!

490
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,050
Let's prevent it!

491
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,510
School violence!

492
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,930
Let's prevent it!
Let's prevent it!

493
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,060
Let's prevent it.

494
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,310
School violence!

495
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,640
Let's prevent it!

496
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,900
They took my laptop
and anything that was worth a dime.

497
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,110
- Will you be able to catch them?
- Yes, we'll do our best to catch them.

498
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,490
Are these all the security cameras here?

499
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,950
There's more...

500
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,740
...but they've probably been broken
for a while.

501
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,410
So, the security cameras are broken...

502
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,990
Do you know what's upstairs?

503
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,460
I hear a man is running
an investment company or something.

504
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,750
I wonder if they took anything from him.

505
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,920
Goodness.

506
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,760
Hello.

507
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,300
- Who are you?
- We're the police.

508
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,600
There's been a burglary downstairs,

509
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,350
so we came by to check
if you had anything going missing.

510
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,640
No, we're fine.

511
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,980
Sir. Just a second.

512
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,230
Everything's okay, right?

513
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,190
That's what I said.

514
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,320
Let's go.

515
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,070
Okay.

516
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,370
What?

517
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,900
This is Hana's.

518
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,400
The girl we saw yesterday?

519
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
Yes.

520
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,410
Then this probably has to do
with those kids from last night.

521
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,910
Yes, I stopped by the office
after I went to the hospital,

522
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,460
and the police came by.

523
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,170
Darn it.

524
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,590
Did those brats start talking?

525
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,130
-Gyeongchan.
- Yeah?

526
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,260
Here's where Hana's phone
was last located.

527
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,060
It was indeed the redevelopment area.

528
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,230
Juvenile Affairs is trying to find
the rest of the kids. What do we do?

529
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,730
- Let's call for backup on our way there.
- Sure. You can go.

530
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:53,860
Good luck, sir.

531
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,170
He still hasn't talked yet?

532
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,300
Damn it.

533
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,850
It's within 50 meters from here.

534
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,020
Should I wait for backup?

535
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,600
You go that way.

536
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,980
Seonga!

537
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,280
Jeez...

538
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,450
Forget everything else.

539
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,580
Just tell us where the flash drive is.
The one in the safe.

540
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,160
And we'll spare your life, all right?

541
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,700
We really don't know anything.

542
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,130
Fuck! Do something about it!

543
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,760
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life in a wheelchair?

544
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,300
Hey, hold down his legs.

545
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,430
Hold him!

546
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,140
- Hold down his legs.
- No!

547
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,350
Still not talking?
Go on, start talking!

548
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,480
-No.
-Hey. Move. Let go!

549
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,770
- Hey...
- What?

550
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,400
You bastards...

551
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,770
Get up.

552
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,150
Get up!

553
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,280
What? You want some?

554
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,210
Stop moving around.

555
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,190
We'll take the kid.

556
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,030
Let's go.

557
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,240
Are you okay?

558
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,620
She pretended to be tough,
but now she's crying like a baby.

559
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,290
You were worse back then.

560
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,170
Mr. Woo Jangik.

561
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,470
Do you admit to assaulting and threatening
two minors while imprisoning them?

562
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,470
Imprisoning, assaulting...

563
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,220
Jeez, I was just talking to them.

564
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,600
According to the order of what happened,
Mr. Woo is the victim.

565
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,980
Since a group of them broke in at night
and inflicted injury,

566
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,480
it's trespassing and special assault.

567
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,650
Then why did you say everything was fine
when we visited?

568
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,990
I was embarrassed
about getting beaten up by kids.

569
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,240
Do you think that makes sense?

570
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,240
- Yes.
- Wait a second.

571
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,040
Mr. Woo simply didn't want
to make things worse.

572
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,710
Isn't it better to let them go
after giving them discipline

573
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,460
than handing them over to the police?

574
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
Discipline?

575
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:30,010
Having gangsters assault teenagers.

576
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,510
You call that discipline?

577
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,720
When we settle with the perpetrators,
we'll keep that in mind...

578
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,270
Who are you calling perpetrators?

579
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,750
-Sure. Keep up the good work.
-Yes. Take care.

580
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,790
Investigation without detention,
obviously.

581
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,670
The lawyer used to be the presiding judge
at Geumo District Court.

582
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,210
Even if we detain him,
he'll file for a review of legality.

583
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,130
Then we'll have to let him go anyway.

584
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,720
Did you find out anything about that jerk?

585
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,050
Of recently, he's Geumo's biggest spender.

586
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,520
He's buying up all the buildings
around the abandoned redevelopment area.

587
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,520
The more I think about it,
the more suspicious it seems.

588
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,240
What is?

589
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,360
Everything. Moving to Geumo
when he has no family or friends here,

590
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:39,950
then investing a huge amount of money
in the redevelopment area.

591
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,250
He must be filthy rich.

592
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,010
What?

593
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,470
This is where all the dirty interests
were connected together back then.

594
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,310
It feels like something's going on again.

595
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,150
It's all in the past.

596
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,860
- Detective Kim.
- Take your hands off this case.

597
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,280
What?

598
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,990
Do you have evidence?

599
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:20,530
If you're going to make forced assumptions
without any evidence, don't even start.

600
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,540
What are you talking about?

601
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,210
You're unnecessarily empathizing
with this Hana kid.

602
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,080
You can't investigate objectively.

603
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:42,970
All right.

604
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,520
Lee Seonga.

605
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,490
Seonga!

606
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,910
Hey.

607
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,580
- Yes?
- You stop her.

608
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:05,160
Get her hands off this case
no matter what.

609
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,540
Got it?

610
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,420
All right.

611
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,350
Hello.

612
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,240
That's bad for your health.

613
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,500
You'd be surprised if you knew
just how much sugar is in that tiny cup.

614
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,460
Use the coffee machine.
The coffee beans are really good.

615
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,550
By the way, Detective.

616
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:09,060
How did you feel back then? When...

617
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:12,770
When you found Chairman Jang's body
after he killed himself?

618
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:15,730
Satisfaction?

619
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:17,900
Emptiness?

620
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,530
Or...

621
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,240
just sadness?

622
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,660
What do you think?

623
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,700
Me?

624
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,830
Ah...

625
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,920
I think I would've been really angry.

626
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,050
Because I should have put him
behind bars myself

627
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,090
but wasn't able to.

628
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,390
I was relieved.

629
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:55,560
Since then,
I've been able to sleep soundly.

630
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,380
You little punk, I told you guys
to go ahead and drink without me.

631
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,460
You came all the way here.
Just come with me.

632
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,010
Let's go in.

633
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:30,600
WE DO NOT TURN OUR BACK ON ANY REQUEST
MIDEUM PLANNING

634
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,640
Jeez!

635
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,230
That kid really brought him.

636
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:35,980
Nice.

637
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,230
Goodness. You're here, Taekrok.

638
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,900
- You call him like that?
- Hey!

639
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,150
Why aren't you in the studio?

640
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,570
I've got a life too, you know.

641
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,030
Taekrok. Let me fill your glass.

642
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,660
- Congratulations on your comeback.
- Congrats, my foot.

643
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,250
-I ate too much.
- And congrats on making your position.

644
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,160
Thank you.

645
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,870
Hey, how's business?
Do you have any customers?

646
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,710
Gosh, you're just clueless.

647
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,420
There's no such thing as a recession here.

648
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,380
The never-ending inflation in Geumo

649
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,300
suddenly just plummeted
when the redevelopment stopped.

650
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,800
That was actually good for me.

651
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,930
Because of that, a ton of couples
are getting divorced because of money.

652
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,220
What on earth is your specialty?

653
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,390
I do everything they ask me to do.

654
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,560
- Then fill my cup for me.
- Here, kid.

655
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,400
Fill your own damn cup.

656
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,480
- Don't be so harsh.
-Right.

657
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,860
-I wanted to give up, you know?
-You still passed.

658
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:31,330
When I heard you passed the police exam,
I was so surprised.

659
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:35,040
I thought, "Gosh, the police must have
really hit rock bottom."

660
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:40,830
When I heard you were an ex-cop,
I thought of giving up the exam.

661
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,420
Hey.

662
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,590
Let's go for a smoke.

663
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,350
Me?

664
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,770
Top me off, sir.

665
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:08,240
I thought you quit smoking, Detective.

666
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,330
I have a favor to ask.

667
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,870
GEUMO POLICE STATION

668
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,010
Hello, Team Leader Yeon.

669
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,630
What brings you here, Sergeant Lee?

670
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,680
Ah...

671
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,890
- I was wondering what happened to Hana.
- Hana?

672
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,640
She's currently being investigated.

673
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,810
Once we wrap things up,
a social worker will be taking her. Why?

674
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,060
Could I have a word with her?

675
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,360
Yes, go ahead.

676
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:47,030
Thank you.

677
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,040
You...

678
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,820
Hey, lady.

679
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,660
Why do you keep worrying about me?

680
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,330
When I was like you,

681
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,590
there was a grown-up who did that for me.

682
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,010
I felt less lonely back then.

683
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,380
Is it...

684
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,220
the man who drove me home with you?

685
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,390
That's right.

686
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:05,150
He was the only one who listened
to what I said and believed me.

687
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:11,690
Then...

688
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:14,200
will you believe me too?

689
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,070
It's true

690
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,620
that we've been stealing this whole time,

691
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,290
but we didn't steal anything
from that man's office.

692
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:25,000
Really.

693
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:31,300
Okay.

694
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,090
I believe you.

695
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,300
Hana,

696
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:37,180
we have to go now.

697
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,480
Let me give you my card again...

698
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,730
I have it.

699
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,730
The one you gave me before.

700
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,330
YOUNGSEO WELFARE FOUNDATION

701
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:19,510
Did you have a nice chat?

702
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,760
Yes. Thank you.

703
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:23,430
It's nothing.

704
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,440
So what's going to happen to her now?

705
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,020
First, she'll go to the hospital
to get a few checkups.

706
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,780
And then, following her wishes,
she'll be entering a youth care facility.

707
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,110
They'll investigate her during her stay.

708
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:38,160
And if there's evidence
of prior domestic violence,

709
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,490
we will take follow-up measures.

710
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,780
- It's a good thing, right?
- At least,

711
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,750
she won't be out in the streets anymore.

712
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:52,250
Oh, right. I read Hana's statement,
and there was something off about it.

713
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,710
- What...
- She said that the kidnapper

714
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,970
kept telling her to give him
the flash drive in the safe.

715
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:02,300
- Excuse me?
- The theft case you've been investigating.

716
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,890
None of them had a safe robbed, right?

717
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,930
That's right.
The kids never touched any safes.

718
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:10,350
Exactly. Hana wouldn't have lied
about something like that.

719
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,810
Sir. Just a second.

720
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,990
I think this needs to be looked into.

721
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,910
I'll be on my way.

722
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,580
Up until now,
the kids never touched any safes.

723
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,710
If the thing Woo Jangik is looking for
was in his safe,

724
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,260
someone else took it.

725
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,680
I need to go see him again.

726
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,850
Then summon him to the station
for questioning.

727
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,100
- Or go with me.

728
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,930
No matter how much I think about it,

729
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,390
Woo Jangik isn't a typical businessman.

730
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,190
I think there's a connection
to Chairman Jang

731
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,400
who was after the redevelopment.

732
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,780
That's a bit of a stretch.

733
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:03,910
<i><font color="#80FFFF">There's nothing definitive.</i></font>

734
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,700
Forget it.
Hang up if that's all you have to say.

735
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,130
- Lieutenant Kim.
-Yes?

736
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,220
The Sanyong-dong sexual assault case.

737
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,930
Where's the victim's statement?

738
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,310
Just a second.

739
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,100
Women and Juvenile Affairs.

740
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,400
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Seonga is on her way
to Woo Jangik's office.</i></font>

741
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,230
I tried to stop her,
but she doesn't listen.

742
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,780
Lieutenant Kim?

743
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,370
- What, is there an emergency?
- We'll talk later.

744
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,120
-Yes, sir?
- Where are you now?

745
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,290
Woo Jangik's office.
I have to look into something.

746
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,340
Hey!

747
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,000
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I told you not to worry about it.</i></font>

748
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,800
Listen to me. Don't go in there.

749
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,720
Detective, what on earth is this about...

750
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:56,830
Seonga!
