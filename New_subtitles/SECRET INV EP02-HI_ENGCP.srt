About 15 years ago,

I was part of an eyes-only,
top-secret presentation.

416
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:13,375
It was about
a shape-shifting alien species

417
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:16,250
that had sent a few of its light ships
crashing down to Earth.

418
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,500
The Pentagon was concerned

419
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:22,583
that they might get into their heads
to invade us one day from the inside.

420
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,542
That invasion is real. It's happened.

421

That's... That's not possible.

422
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,833
Yeah, that's what I thought, too,
but it's true.

423
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:33,625
And here's the crazy part,

424
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:37,542
we're being invaded and we can't even tell
who the invaders are.

425
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,625

426
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:42,875
Maybe we should call our friends.

00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,458
No, no, no, we can't jump the gun on that.

in a fight with the Skrulls

all the political capital I had

was protecting the planet.

But you should know better than most.

465
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:24,917
The reason we wrestled this power
from mediocre men who don't look like us

466
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,208
was not simply to turn around
and hand it to mediocre men who do.

467
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:31,500
The point of this power
is to be uncompromising,

468
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,250
to be unsparing,

469
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,542
to be able to sit across
from a man we greatly admire,

with whom we share an entire professional,
personal, ancestral history with

471
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:45,292
and to tell him without any reservation,
that he's fired.
