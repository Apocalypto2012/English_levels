1
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,680
What went we out
into this wilderness to find?

2
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,691
Leaving our country, kindred...

3
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,207
our father's houses?

4
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,085
We travailed a vast ocean...

5
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:31,019
For what? For what?

6
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,780
We must ask thee to be silent.

7
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,819
Was it not for the pure
and faithful dispensation of the Gospels

8
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,003
- and the Kingdom of God?
- No more!

9
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,020
We are your judges, and not you ours.

10
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,009
I cannot be judged by false Christians,

11
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,579
for I have done nothing
save preach Christ through gospel.

12
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,579
Must you continue to dishonor

13
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,322
the laws of the commonwealth
and the church with your prideful conceit?

14
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,020
If my conscience sees it fit.

15
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,522
Then shall you be banished
from this plantation's liberties!

16
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,319
I would be glad on it.

17
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,043
Then take your leave
and trouble us no further.

18
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,043
How sadly hath the Lord
testified against you.

19
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,045
Katherine.

20
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,259
Thomasin.

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,646
Come.

22
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,379
I will confess Jehovah with all heart

23
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:26,819
In secret and in assembly of the just...

24
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,166
I here confess I've lived in sin.

25
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:09,043
I've been idle of my work,
disobedient to my parents,

26
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,401
neglectful of my prayer.

27
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,620
I have, in secret, played upon my Sabbath.

28
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,360
And broken every one of thy
commandments in thought.

29
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,927
Followed the desires of mine
own will, and not the Holy Spirit.

30
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,725
I know I deserve more shame
and misery in this life...

31
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,689
and everlasting hellﬁre.

32
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,603
But I beg Thee...
for the sake of Thy Son...

33
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,740
forgive me, show me mercy,

34
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,571
show me Thy light.

35
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,285
Thomasin.

36
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,939
Boo!

37
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,090
There you are, there you are.

38
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,220
Boo!

39
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,802
Where is Sam? Where is Sam?

40
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,764
Where is that little man?

41
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,899
Boo!

42
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,899
There you are, there you are.

43
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,009
Boo!

44
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,682
Sam.

45
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,603
Samuel!

46
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:34,645
Thomasin.

47
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,659
Sleep.

48
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,402
All will be well, sleep.

49
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,244
Caleb.

50
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,100
God give you good morrow.

51
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,539
All are still a-bed.

52
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,041
Save Mother.

53
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,059
Tis no ease to rise on a gray day.

54
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,845
The Devil holds fast your eyelids.

55
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,727
- I'll wake em.
- No, let em be.

56
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,963
Thy Mother's not slept a night since...

57
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,567
We can search no more, Caleb. We cannot.

58
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,322
If not a wolf, then hunger
would have taken him yet.

59
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,644
Let's to the wood.

60
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,299
Been a'layin traps for some while now,

61
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,539
even before this new misery.

62
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,179
Within the wood?

63
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,460
Will thou not help thy father?

64
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,802
You and Mother have always
forbade us to set foot there.

65
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,940
Caleb, our harvest cannot last the winter.

66
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,980
We must catch our food
if we cannot grow it.

67
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,801
We will conquer this wilderness.
It will not consume us.

68
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,299
Aren't thou then born a sinner?

69
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,280
Aye, I was conceived in sin
and born in iniquity.

70
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,620
Then what is thy birth sin?

71
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,419
Adam's sin imputed to me and a corrupt
nature dwelling within me.

72
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,539
Well remembered, Caleb, very well.

73
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,220
And canst thou tell me
what thy corrupt nature is?

74
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,379
My corrupt nature is empty of grace,

75
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,460
bent unto sin, only unto sin
and that continually.

76
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,369
Soft now.

77
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,842
We must lay it again.

78
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,724
Was, was Samuel born a sinner?

79
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,179
Aye.

80
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,644
Am I then...

81
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,220
We pray he hath entered God's Kingdom.

82
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,659
What wickedness hath he done?

83
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,779
Place faith in God, Caleb.

84
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,500
We'll speak no more on thy brother.

85
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,419
Why?

86
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,284
He hath disappeared, not one week passed.

87
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,419
Yet you and Mother utter not his name.

88
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,500
He's gone, Caleb.

89
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,419
- Tell me!
- Tell thee what?

90
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:14,340
- Is he in hell?
- Caleb!

91
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,408
Mother will not stop her prayer.

92
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,580
And if I died, if I died this day...

93
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,921
- What is this?
- I ought evil in me heart.

94
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,620
- Me sins are not pardoned!
- Thou art youngly yet...

95
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,620
And if God will not hear my prayers?!

96
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,881
- Caleb!
- Tell me!

97
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,259
Look you, I love thee marvelous well,

98
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,779
but 'tis God alone, not man,

99
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,884
what knows who is the son
of Abraham and who is not,

100
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,100
who is good and who is evil.

101
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,779
Fain would I tell thee
Sam sleeps in Jesus,

102
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,539
that thou wilt, that I will.

103
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,565
But I cannot tell thee that. None can.

104
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,539
Caleb?

105
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,927
Where are these from?

106
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,884
From Indian Tom and old Slater,
when last they past through.

107
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,769
What did you trade?

108
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,723
Thy Mother's silver cup.

109
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:43,740
Speak none of this to Mother. None.

110
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,286
She's overwrought already.

111
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,140
I'll tell her of the cup
when her grief has passed.

112
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,339
Let's not speak on this again.

113
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,124
Aye.

114
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,019
Fowler!

115
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,140
Fool of an animal.

116
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,900
Fowler!

117
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,380
Fowler, what's this?

118
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,881
Praise be to God. Make haste, Caleb.

119
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,483
Fie upon't!

120
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,700
- Father, it died.
- The other end.

121
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,259
Father?

122
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,140
Father!

123
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,700
Fowler.

124
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,420
Black Phillip, Black Phillip,
a crown grows on his head

125
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,001
Black Phillip, Black Phillip
to nanny queen is wed

126
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,339
Jump to the fence post...

127
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,420
- Jonas! Mercy! Come hither!
- Black Phillip, Black Phillip

128
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,740
King of all...

129
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,365
Jonas! Mercy!

130
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,460
Black Phillip, Black Phillip,
king of sky and land

131
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,099
Black Phillip, Black Phillip,
king of sea and sand

132
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,779
We are ye servants, we are ye men

133
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,770
Black Phillip eats the lions
from the lions' den.

134
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,447
Black Phillip, Black Phillip,
a crown grows on his head...

135
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,339
Get back! You two, stop that!

136
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,380
Phillip, back!

137
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,484
Heavens bless us!

138
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,123
Caleb, hold the gate.

139
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,740
Caleb!

140
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:15,047
Get in!

141
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,819
Oh.

142
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,646
I'll have thee quiet.

143
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,059
Wither were you and Caleb this morn?

144
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,380
How could you disappear?

145
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,299
And thee, I told thee to keep
watch of Jonas and Mercy.

146
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,980
I was, and I bade them help me
and they paid me no mind.

147
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,299
- I was a-getting...
- What's the matter with thee, Thomasin?

148
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,380
What is the matter with thee?

149
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,299
Take thy father's rags to
the brook and wash them.

150
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,259
- They would pay me no mind.
- And brush out his woolens.

151
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,645
Help him!

152
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,900
Wee one, it gave me such
a fright to find thee gone.

153
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,888
I will not be left here alone. Dost hear?

154
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,940
A morning's work is well behindhand.

155
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,167
Jonas, leave thy sister be.

156
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,964
- She likes it.
- William.

157
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,460
What, can't a father spend
Godly time with his son?

158
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,779
Jonas!

159
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,460
- Father said stop it.
- Thomasin!

160
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,163
- Stop.
- Stop it!

161
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,169
Each of ya, stop it.

162
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,819
Thomasin, take the twins inside.

163
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,604
No!

164
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,326
Get inside, get inside, get inside.

165
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,800
As you like.

166
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:34,726
We went to find apples!

167
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,171
In the valley.

168
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,980
I thought I seen an apple tree
in the valley.

169
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:44,059
Father brought the gun,
for if we glanced that wolf...

170
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,420
Why did you not tell me?

171
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:48,921
Father wanted it a surprise,
to cheer you, and...

172
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,931
but there were none.

173
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,848
I thought I seen em.

174
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,500
I like you not outside
the farm, even to the valley.

175
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,840
Dost hear me?

176
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,446
Caleb, be a good lad
and get some water for thy Mother.

177
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:18,369
Stray not from the brook.

178
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,124
Why are you dallying?

179
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,045
What then?

180
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,005
What?

181
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,602
Caleb? Caleb!

182
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,559
Stop it.

183
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,603
I meant no harm in it.

184
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,403
What's the matter with thee?

185
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,759
Come hither.

186
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,539
What's the matter with thee, eh?

187
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,246
Shh.

188
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,220
I've seen no apples
since we went from England.

189
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,420
I would thou hadst found them.

190
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,180
I so wish for one.

191
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:13,059
Hear that?

192
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,490
Aye.

193
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,940
Who's there?

194
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,019
I be the Witch of the Wood!

195
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,539
Mercy, come out.

196
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,324
I be not Mercy,

197
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,420
I be the Witch of the Wood
and I have come to steal ye.

198
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:30,420
Hear me stick a-flying through the trees:

199
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:33,220
Clickety-clackity, clickety-clackity!

200
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,420
- Mercy!
- Clickety-clackity.

201
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,900
Why is't when thou dost a wrong,

202
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,099
I be a-washin Father's clothes
like a slave,

203
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,819
- and thou art playing idle?
- Because Mother hates you.

204
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,539
Spoilt child. I'll tell Mother
you've left the farm alone.

205
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,801
Black Phillip saith I can do what I like.

206
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,299
Devil take your Black Phillip.

207
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,460
It's your fault I can't leave the yard.

208
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,859
I could go to the brook
before you let The Witch take Sam.

209
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,019
- Quiet, thee.
- It were a wolf stole Sam.

210
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,363
A witch. I've seen her in her
riding cloak, about the wood.

211
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,140
- Father showed me the tracks.
- It was a witch.

212
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,980
Aye, it was a witch,
Mercy, you speak aright.

213
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,660
- Thomasin!
- It was I.

214
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,059
Liar.

215
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,539
Twas I what stole him,
I be the witch of the wood.

216
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,660
- Liar! Liar!
- I am.

217
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,500
List not to her, Mercy.

218
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,779
I am that very witch.

219
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,339
When I sleep, my spirit slips
away from my body

220
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,180
and dances naked with The Devil.

221
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,859
- That's how I signed his book.
- No.

222
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,099
He bade me bring him an unbaptized babe,

223
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,339
so I stole Sam
and I gave him to me master.

224
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,700
And I'll make any man
or thing else vanish I like.

225
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,500
- No.
- Aye.

226
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:45,660
And I'll vanish thee, too,
if thou displeaseth me.

227
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:48,500
- Be quiet!
- Mercy, she's but telling fantasies.

228
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,700
Perchance I boil and bake thee
since we're lack of food.

229
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,900
- No!
- Stop, Thomasin!

230
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,819
- It's not true!
- It is, thou thing!

231
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,819
How I crave to sink my teeth
into thy pink flesh.

232
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,819
If ever thou tellst thy Mother of this,

233
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,099
I'll witch thee and thy Mother!
And Jonas too!

234
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,140
- Caleb!
- Stop thy tears and swear by silence.

235
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,380
- I swear it.
- You'll not tell Mother nor father.

236
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,059
- I swear.
- Thomasin! Let her alone.

237
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,561
Get away from her, Caleb,
or she'll witch thee!

238
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:19,328
Why tell Mercy those horrible fantasies?

239
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,088
- Dost thou hate me now too?
- It was a wolf stole Sam.

240
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,420
Leave me be. Go tell Mother
and father of my wickedness.

241
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,319
- Thomasin...
- I hate thy pity. I need it not.

242
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,900
And forgive us the sins we have
this day committed against thee,

243
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,700
free us from the shame and torment
which are due unto us, Father.

244
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:51,299
We beseech thee, increase our faith
in the promise of the Gospel,

245
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,220
our fear of thy name
and the hatred of all our sins,

246
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:58,779
that we may be assured that
the Holy Spirit dwells in us.

247
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,099
That we might be thy children
in thy love and mercy,

248
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,819
but as we hunger
for this food of our bodies

249
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,740
so our souls hunger
for the food of eternal life.

250
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:13,288
Finish soon our days of sin,
and bring us to eternal peace

251
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,940
through the purifying blood of Thy Son,

252
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:20,259
our Lord and only Savior Jesus Christ.

253
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,965
- Amen.
- Amen.

254
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,326
Thomasin, what's thou done
with the silver cup?

255
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,380
Is't not on the shelf?

256
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,323
Nay.

257
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,460
In the six board, then.

258
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:14,579
T'ain't there neither.

259
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,286
It's been disappeared for some while.

260
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,605
Didst lose it?

261
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,730
I've not touched it.

262
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,819
Where has it gone then?

263
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,140
I haven't touched it.

264
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,180
I've caught thee trifling with it before.

265
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:32,851
She says she haven't touched it,
Katherine.

266
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,380
How thou couldst lose my father's
silver wine cup in this hovel,

267
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,819
- I cannot know.
- I haven't touched it.

268
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,763
Peace, child. It's gone.

269
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,967
Did a wolf vanish that too?

270
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,242
She haven't touched it, Katherine.

271
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,244
What is amiss on this farm? Hmm?

272
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,599
It is not natural.

273
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:21,483
Caleb, will thou read out
a chapter of the Word tonight?

274
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,180
We must find some light in our darkness.

275
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,807
Tomorrow we will have a fast day
but for our sins.

276
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,410
Thomasin, dist not bed them down
before supper?

277
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,180
Baah, baah.

278
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:45,339
Oh, Holy and blessed Spirit,
be with me and dwell in me heart.

279
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,619
You must sleep tonight, Kate.

280
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,963
This night and evermore, amen.

281
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:14,059
Thou dost remember I love thee?

282
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,010
I do.

283
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,380
List me, Kate,

284
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,723
I fear thou dost look
too much upon this affliction.

285
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,080
We must turn our thoughts
towards God, not to ourselves.

286
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,601
He hath never taken a child from us.
Never a one, Kate.

287
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,490
Who might earn such grace?

288
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,766
We have been grateful of God's love.

289
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,180
He hath cursed this family.

290
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,566
No.

291
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,420
He hath taken us
into a very low condition to humble us

292
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,048
and to show us more of His grace.

293
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:21,128
Was not Christ lead into the wilderness
to be ill met by the Devil?

294
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:24,140
We should ne'er have left the plantation.

295
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,539
Kate.

296
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,299
- We should never have left!
- That damned church.

297
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,769
- There's naught hither!
- Well, what need we? Silver chalices?

298
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:37,740
How dare you chide me on a cup?

299
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,059
Tis not for vanity
that I am grieved of it.

300
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,579
Katherine, I must tell thee...

301
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,180
- We might have sold it.
- What?

302
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,000
What fool would trade for our corn?

303
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:04,049
List me, our daughter hath begat
the sign of her womanhood.

304
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:09,819
Thomasin? Caleb?

305
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,220
Are you abed?

306
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:14,288
Mercy?

307
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,519
Jonas?

308
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:23,539
She's old enough.
She must leave to serve another family.

309
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,619
Twas not her fault.
Kate, I must tell thee...

310
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,740
Aye, it was thine
for taking thy family hither.

311
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,140
This is Godly land.

312
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,660
Godly?

313
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,619
Our children are being fostered up
like savages.

314
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,940
Kate!

315
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:39,180
How oft I begged and begged thee
to take Samuel for baptism?

316
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,740
They'd not baptize
outside the congregation.

317
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:43,700
Our Sam is in hell!

318
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,644
Go to.

319
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,500
God save us, Caleb is well.

320
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,500
We must keep him still. And Thomasin.

321
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:53,940
Our corn is trash!

322
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:56,059
We cannot back to that church.

323
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,570
We will starve!

324
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,059
Peace, peace. You'll wake them, peace.

325
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,460
I'll to the village with the horse
and Thomasin tomorrow.

326
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:13,980
The Tildens or the Whythings,

327
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,619
they can make use of her.

328
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,619
They're good folk.

329
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,963
Stop, Kate.

330
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:26,766
We will find food, I know it.

331
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,724
Caleb?

332
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,420
What are you doing?

333
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:57,090
Go to sleep.

334
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,447
What is this? Tell me, now.

335
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:06,179
- Running away then?
- No.

336
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,019
- Lie not to me.
- I don't.

337
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,659
Then what?

338
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,219
Tell me!

339
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,099
If thou went back to sleep
and kept silent of this,

340
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,500
I promise thee,

341
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,219
you'll need not leave to serve
the Tildens nor any family else.

342
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,766
I'll be back by mid-day.

343
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,619
- Well, let me along with ya.
- No.

344
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:32,326
- Let me along.
- I cannot.

345
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,202
If you don't let me along with ya,

346
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,128
I'll wake Mother and father this instant.

347
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,889
Well?

348
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,340
Aye, but we did!

349
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,059
- Nay.
- We did!

350
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,940
No.

351
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,451
We had glass windows in England.

352
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:10,940
We haven't been hither
so long you can forget that.

353
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,619
As you like, Thomasin?

354
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,940
You've gone mad.

355
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,940
Dost not remember Fowler
laying on the floor in the sun?

356
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,780
- You must!
- Nay.

357
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,260
And where the sun would shine,
would he warm himself.

358
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,380
Remember once he lay upon the table,
and father saw him and he saith,

359
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,260
"We will have him for meat!

360
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,980
Kate! Kate! We will roast this beast."

361
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,619
You must remember that!

362
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,219
I remember that day, but no glass.

363
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,699
Well... it was pretty.

364
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,003
What is't, boy?

365
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,619
Burt, calm thee!

366
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:57,451
Fowler! Nay, Fowler!

367
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,699
Stand here with Burt.

368
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,619
- Caleb, no.
- I'll straight back.

369
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,739
He's gone mad!

370
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,300
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

371
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,128
- Thomasin!
- Thomasin!

372
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:19,539
- Caleb!
- Caleb!

373
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:24,539
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

374
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:27,420
Thomasin!

375
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,365
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

376
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,686
Thomasin!

377
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:50,179
Fowler!

378
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,161
O God, my Lord, I now begin,
o help me and I'll leave my sin.

379
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,726
For I repentant now shall be,
From evil I will turn to Thee.

380
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,340
None ever shall destroy my faith,
nor do I mind what Satan saith.

381
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,161
O God, my Lord, I now begin,
O, help me and I'll leave my sin,

382
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,659
For I repentant now shall be,
from evil I will turn to Thee.

383
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,300
None ever shall destroy my faith,

384
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,367
nor do I mind what Satan saith.

385
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,619
O God, my Lord, I now begin,
O help me and I...

386
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,481
Caleb!

387
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,722
Caleb!

388
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,579
- Caleb!
- Father!

389
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,090
Thomasin.

390
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:21,530
Oh, my girl, my girl.

391
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,088
Where is thy brother?

392
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:23,260
What's the matter with thee, Thomasin?
What's the matter with thee?

393
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,980
I'll set off at first light.
I'll not return until I've found him.

394
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:30,019
T'would be better to go to the village
to raise up help, I cannot...

395
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,500
Tis a day's ride and I have no horse.

396
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:34,099
There's no time to be lost.

397
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:36,980
Likely you should have left
this morn, then.

398
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,579
You have no gun, William,
nay, not even a dog.

399
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:41,659
- Be not a fool!
- I am a fool to go.

400
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,161
There is none will help this family.

401
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:48,927
Let me be!

402
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,440
The moon is bright,
the rain bothers me not.

403
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:55,380
I'll be back in a two-day,
if any a man will return with me.

404
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,244
- Don't go, Father!
- Enough!

405
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,300
Tell us why you went to the wood.

406
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,800
- I promised.
- I care not!

407
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:12,579
Let me find favor in your eyes.

408
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:15,809
Oh, child, tell me and I will!

409
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,840
I, um...

410
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,601
Speak!

411
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:26,324
I...

412
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,081
I took thy father's cup.

413
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,164
I sold it.

414
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,882
Forgive me, Kate. Forgive me, Thomasin.

415
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,840
What is this?

416
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,364
Katherine, I must make confession.

417
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,969
I yestermorn took Caleb to the wood.

418
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:09,619
Twas for food,
and the pelts for money, good money.

419
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:11,699
I knew you were false! I knew it!

420
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,300
I meant it as a surprise,
that is why I kept secret.

421
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,940
I will trap that wolf, Kate.

422
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:17,980
You stood by whilst our son lied to me!

423
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,900
Twas for thy sake! I love thee, Kate.

424
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,570
- You took him to the woods!
- I will find him!

425
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:24,568
You've broken God's covenant.
You're a liar.

426
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:26,300
And you've lost another child.

427
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,900
- I will go now.
- You cannot escape the woods.

428
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,500
I will find him!

429
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,099
And kill thyself too?
Will Jonas be the man of the house?

430
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:36,179
Will you damn all your family to death?!

431
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,726
- Katherine!
- Let go of me!

432
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,963
Picking apples.

433
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:06,019
Mother, have the goats
been bedded down yet?

434
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:08,340
- Nay.
- I'll to it.

435
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,260
Let it wait til the morrow.
They dare not escape with this rain.

436
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,219
Nay, I'll to it.

437
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,179
Please you, Mother.

438
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,202
Come hither, child.

439
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,010
Hurry back.

440
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:21,960
Caleb...

441
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:26,380
Father!

442
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,969
Caleb, Caleb...

443
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:57,802
Shh.

444
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:38,539
Oh, merciful Father,

445
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:41,300
both the Lord and giver of life.

446
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,179
Thy sole, Jesus Christ, we beseech thee.

447
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,260
Look down from Heaven upon him

448
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,260
with those eyes of grace and compassion.

449
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,019
Pity thy wounded servant...

450
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:32,099
Baa, baa. Baa, baa, baa.

451
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:34,739
What ails Caleb, Black Phillip?
What ails him?

452
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,380
Did Thomasin make 'im sick in the wood?

453
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,739
What say you?

454
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,807
Black Phillip says you are wicked.

455
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,420
Aye, he told me too.

456
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,806
Damn your Black Phillip.

457
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,244
He says you put the Devil
in Caleb, that's why he's sick.

458
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,980
I'd never hurt Caleb, nor Sam, nor thee.

459
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,900
- You beat me.
- T'was a jest.

460
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,619
- You said you'd eat of me.
- Mercy!

461
00:48:55,719 --> 00:48:57,179
Mother and Father will find out.

462
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,820
- What?
- That you are a witch!

463
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,490
Thomasin!

464
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,460
Thomasin?

465
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,840
Dost remember John Kempe's son?

466
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,340
That first winter, he was
tormented of Indian magic.

467
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,219
'Tis not the same.

468
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,500
- This is unnatural providence.
- I know not that.

469
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,840
Look at thy son.

470
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:00,219
- Will.
- What?

471
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,889
- Think!
- Think what?

472
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,940
- Think!
- I have no thoughts.

473
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:07,179
Does this not look like witchcraft?

474
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,849
What witch?

475
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:12,202
Who does this then? Who?

476
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:15,527
Thy thoughts are as a child.

477
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:23,724
What are you doing?

478
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,849
We'll back to the plantation
in the morning.

479
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,123
Find a good family for Thomasin,
take Caleb to the doctor's.

480
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,202
He'll tell if this be
some natural ill or not.

481
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:40,139
Yet we cannot return as beggars.

482
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:44,699
I'll scour the field. There must be
some fruit yet untouched by this rot.

483
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,699
I beseech thee, Katherine,
what canst thou do for him presently?

484
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,780
How might we all bare it
to the village with no horse?

485
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,539
Well, the little corn and the goat
should fetch a fair price.

486
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:56,019
We'll... We'll back with Caleb
and sell them,

487
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,121
return with the horse
for the twins and Thomasin.

488
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:00,619
- You cannot leave them here!
- Thomasin and thee...

489
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:02,340
Oh, forget the crop, Will!

490
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,460
What?!

491
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,369
What dost thou want, Katherine?

492
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,965
Tell me and I will give it thee.

493
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,525
I want to be home.

494
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:20,860
Thou shall be home,
by candle-time tomorrow.

495
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,405
In England.

496
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,219
Oh, Will...

497
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,085
I also have a confession to make.

498
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,605
I never meant to be a shrew to thee.

499
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,206
I have become as Job's wife, I know it.

500
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,528
But since Sam, since...

501
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,445
My heart has turned to stone.

502
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:09,019
I dreamed once,
t'was when I was of Thomasin's years,

503
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,601
that I was with Christ upon Earth.

504
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:17,619
Oh, I was so very near Him.

505
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:22,420
And in many tears for the assurance
of the pardon of me sins.

506
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:26,619
And I was so ravaged
with His love towards me,

507
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:31,168
I thought it far exceeding
the affection of the kindest husband.

508
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,760
And since Samuel disappeared...

509
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,860
I have such a sad weakness
of faith, I cannot shake it.

510
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,460
I cannot see Christ's help as near.

511
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:48,768
I pray and I pray, but I cannot.

512
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:56,007
I fear I cannot ever feel
that same measure of love again.

513
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:04,891
Thou shall have of it in Heaven.

514
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,579
I'll be in field.

515
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:14,500
If you can spare a while, do.

516
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:16,260
We'll leave at dawn.

517
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,123
I promise thee that.

518
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,320
Jonas, Mercy, come hither!

519
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:29,369
Speak not a word!

520
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,380
Black Phillip is a merry, merry king

521
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,085
- He rules the land with mirth...
- I cannot abide your songs.

522
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:46,940
Please you, Mercy.

523
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:48,619
Black Phillip has a mighty, mighty sting

524
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:50,460
He'll knock thee to the Earth

525
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,739
Sing bah, bah, King Phillip, the black

526
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,500
- Sing bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
- Peace, thou thing!

527
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,340
Mercy. Thomasin.

528
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,340
Sing bah, bah, King Phillip, the black

529
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,139
- He'll knock thee on thy back!
- Enough!

530
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,170
Come.

531
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:12,940
Get the broadaxe and cut off her head.

532
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:16,179
Get the narrow axe and cut off her head.

533
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,739
Get the broadaxe and cut off her head.

534
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,126
Get the narrow axe and cut off her head.

535
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,539
She's upon me!

536
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:27,085
She kneels!

537
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:28,699
My bowels!

538
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,041
My stomach!

539
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:32,525
She pinches!

540
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:39,579
Sin! Sin! Sin!!

541
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:42,159
Thomasin, take the children outside.

542
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,965
What does this to thee? What does this?

543
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,007
His mouth has sealed up.

544
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:54,860
Oh, God, William!

545
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,099
William! Get him up!

546
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:58,644
Hold him!

547
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,889
Children, away from this! Thomasin, help!

548
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,043
You'll break his jaws.

549
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:09,485
Father!

550
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:12,568
What is...?

551
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,579
William... He is witched!

552
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:29,380
- 'Tis she!
- No!

553
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,739
- What horrible fancy is this?
- She told me she stole Sam!

554
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,260
Silence!

555
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,659
She gave him to the Devil in the wood!

556
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,219
- They lie!
- What say you?

557
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,940
She turned Flora's milk to blood!

558
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:39,619
She had bade us keep secret from you!

559
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:42,739
- It was but a jest to quiet her, I...
- She made bargain with Satan!

560
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,420
- She signed his book!
- Silence!

561
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:46,900
Don't let her near me!
She'll put a curse on me!

562
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,525
- They conspire against me.
- Thomasin is a witch!

563
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:53,739
Nay, I'll not hear it.

564
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,619
I'll have proof, or Heaven help thee.

565
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:58,927
On thy knees!

566
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:01,420
Look me in the eye, daughter.

567
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:04,820
- Dost thou love the word of God?
- Yes.

568
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,019
Love you The Bible? Love you prayer?

569
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:08,849
Yes. Yes!

570
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:14,860
We are children of sin all,

571
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,885
yet I tell thee, I have raised up
no witch in this house.

572
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:25,380
Let us pray, then we need fear nothing.

573
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,403
We shall never lie open to the wicked one.

574
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,842
Pray for thy brother.

575
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:35,005
- You must believe us!
- Evil wretches!

576
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,380
Thomasin!

577
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,460
Pray.

578
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:44,099
Our Father, which art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

579
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:45,769
Jonas, pray.

580
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,739
I... I cannot remember my prayer.

581
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,739
- What?
- Nor I. I cannot.

582
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,420
What nonsense is this?

583
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:56,659
Speak, children.

584
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,445
Our Father, which art in Heaven...

585
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:01,369
...hallowed be thy name

586
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,369
Stop it! Stop it!

587
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,579
Pray, you beasts.

588
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:08,250
Get on thy knees and pray!

589
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,237
Thomasin!

590
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:14,940
I don't hear this. This is not so.

591
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,802
It's her!

592
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,739
A cat.

593
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,420
A crow.

594
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:31,460
A raven. A three-legged dog. A wolf!

595
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:35,780
- She desires of my blood.
- She desires of my blood.

596
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,059
- Satan upon me!
- She desires of my blood!

597
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,780
She sends 'em upon me.

598
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,500
My Lord, my Jesus! Save me!

599
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:51,659
- Think on Christ!
- She sends her devils!

600
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,128
I am thine enemy, wallowing
in the blood of my sins!

601
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,300
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want

602
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,500
He maketh me to lie in green pastures,

603
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:01,931
and leadeth me by the still water...

604
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:03,565
I am thine enemy...

605
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,139
I am thine enemy,

606
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:10,367
wallowing on the blood
and filth of my sin!

607
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,420
- ...I will fear no evil
- For thou art with me.

608
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,846
Caleb... Caleb...

609
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,019
Cast a light of countenance upon me.

610
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,500
Spread over me the lap of Thy love.

611
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:33,699
Wash me in the everflowing
fountains of Thy blood.

612
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,340
Holy Thine I am, my sweet Lord Jesus.

613
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:44,561
My Lord, my love, kiss me
with the kisses of Thy mouth.

614
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:47,402
How lovely art Thou.

615
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:49,601
Thy embrace!

616
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:52,980
My Lord!

617
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:55,539
My Lord! My love!

618
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:57,980
My sole salvation!

619
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:59,900
Take me to Thy lap!

620
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,289
Caleb...

621
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,123
Caleb?

622
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,288
Caleb?

623
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,940
Caleb.

624
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:43,646
Caleb...

625
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:47,202
Wake up, please! Wake up!

626
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,849
Wake up, wake up.

627
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,684
Wake up.

628
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,739
He is dead!

629
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,179
He is dead!

630
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,601
Jonas, Mercy, get up.

631
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:15,610
Get up!

632
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:24,019
Get away from him! Get thee gone!

633
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:40,380
Thomasin!

634
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,179
Thomasin. Thomasin...

635
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,519
My girl...

636
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,940
This tree will be lovely come spring.

637
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:03,360
Do you remember when we came hither?

638
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,681
Such a pretty tree.

639
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:13,126
Next year I'll just own us a wheat field.

640
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:16,900
Start it at this tree and end it thither.

641
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,445
We'd have been a proper farm then.

642
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,440
Brought us a big fat milk cow,
finished us the barn.

643
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,326
You must tell me, Thomasin.

644
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:35,699
Tomorrow I cannot keep secret of this.

645
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,380
The council will be called
and thy life is...

646
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,860
- Thy life...
- Will you not believe me?

647
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,860
I saw The Serpent in my son.
You stopped their prayer, Thom...

648
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,699
- They lie!
- I saw it.

649
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,820
Caleb disappeared with thee.

650
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,402
- I love Caleb.
- And who then found him,

651
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:56,059
pale as death,

652
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:59,289
naked as sin and witch'd?

653
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,619
Thomasin, listen to me.

654
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:03,860
The bargain that was made is of no effect.

655
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,121
- I made no bargain.
- Thy soul belongeth to Christ.

656
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:08,860
- I made no bargain.
- The Devil hath no interest in thee.

657
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,521
- I am no witch, father.
- What did I but see in my house?

658
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:15,887
- Will you not hear me?
- Prithee, confess.

659
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,842
Why have you turned against me?

660
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,139
Christ can un-witch us
if you will but speak truth to me.

661
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:24,860
As I love thee, speak truth.

662
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,851
- You ask me to speak truth?
- I beg thee.

663
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,048
You and Mother planned
to rid the farm of me.

664
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,420
Aye, I heard you speak of it.

665
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:44,521
Is that truth?

666
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,820
You took of Mother's cup
and let her rail at me.

667
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,300
You confessed not till it was too late.

668
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,380
- Is that truth?
- Peace thee.

669
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,739
- I will not.
- I am thy father.

670
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,980
- You are a hypocrite!
- Hold thy tongue, daughter mine.

671
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:01,860
You took Caleb to the wood and let me
take the blame of that too.

672
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,688
Is that truth?

673
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:09,019
You let Mother be as thy master.

674
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,820
You cannot bring the crops to yield!
You cannot hunt!

675
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,619
- Is that truth enough?
- Enough.

676
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:15,739
Thou canst do nothing save cut wood!

677
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,059
Bitch!

678
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:19,460
And you will not hear me!

679
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:24,300
Must I hear the Devil
wag his tongue in thy mouth?

680
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,128
Ask the twins then!

681
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:29,980
Go on, ask them!

682
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,500
They spend all day long
babbling to that horned beast.

683
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:33,820
They know well his voice.

684
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,219
Go to.

685
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,688
The Adversary oft comes
in the shape of a he-goat.

686
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,643
And whispers. Aye, whispers!

687
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:46,460
He is Lucifer. You know it.

688
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,780
- The twins know it too.
- Slander thy brethren no more.

689
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,980
- It is they!
- From my sight!

690
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,059
T'was they and that goat
what bewitched this whole farm.

691
01:03:55,159 --> 01:03:56,400
Lies.

692
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,219
Was't a wolf stole Sam?

693
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,019
I never saw no wolf.

694
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,900
Mercy told me herself by the stream,

695
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,460
"I be the Witch of the Wood."

696
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:09,219
Get up. Rise!

697
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,059
- What is this?
- Speak.

698
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:43,980
I am no witch.

699
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:46,019
Get her from me sight!
I'll not have her in this house!

700
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:47,860
She is no witch, Katherine.

701
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,579
What is the cause, daughter?
Tell thy Mother!

702
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:52,019
I cannot know for certain.

703
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:53,820
Thou toldst me well thou knew.

704
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,380
I cannot look at her.

705
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,121
Aye, but ye shall. Thomasin. Thomasin!

706
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,980
Jonas and Mercy.

707
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:04,969
They make covenant with the Devil
in the shape of Black Phillip.

708
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:09,380
Dost hear that, ye black minions?

709
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,121
Dost hear that, you devils?

710
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:16,807
Wake! Wake from this!

711
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,820
Did ye makes some
unholy bond with that goat?

712
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,809
Speak, if this be pretense.

713
01:05:34,039 --> 01:05:38,539
Dissemblers! Grave pretenders all.

714
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:40,460
Hear me this:

715
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,539
I will not play a fool
to children's games!

716
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:45,699
This is no sport, William.

717
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,139
Yet these lies from our babes' mouths
are but trifles to them.

718
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:52,139
- I do not lie.
- Silence, creature!

719
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:56,179
Thy son is dead, damned!

720
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,179
- Caleb did but cry Jesus.
- The Devil!

721
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,519
Thou know it not.

722
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:02,219
- The Devil will speak scripture too!
- Thou know it not.

723
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,139
- Tis not true!
- We are damned!

724
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:05,684
Wake!

725
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:08,940
Fetch the billhook, wife,

726
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,059
and I will smite Jonas as Abraham
would have done his seed.

727
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:13,420
No, stop it! Stop it!

728
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:16,500
Fetch the billhook
and I will dash his skull!

729
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,940
- No!
- Do you see?

730
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:22,659
- Stop it...
- Do you see now?

731
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:28,528
Please, father.
No, it's not safe. Not with them!

732
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:31,320
Keep me from this goat.

733
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:35,322
If that old billy be the Devil,
I'd have danced with him myself.

734
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,820
I'll break thee out upon the dawn
and we'll set back to the plantation.

735
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,820
Think on thy sins.

736
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,842
Are you witches?

737
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,340
Does father think I am?

738
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,804
Are you?

739
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,405
No.

740
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,327
Does he really speak to thee?

741
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:51,567
It is my fault.

742
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,287
I confess it.

743
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:04,009
I confess it.

744
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,041
Oh, my God.

745
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,364
My own fault.

746
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,770
I am infected with the filth of pride.

747
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,739
I know it.

748
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,444
I am.

749
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:31,805
Dispose of me how Thou will't...

750
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,409
yet redeem my children.

751
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,970
They cannot tame their natural evils.

752
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:52,048
I lie before Thee a coward...

753
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,761
and Thine enemy.

754
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,685
And I lick the dust of Thine earth.

755
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,127
I beg thee.

756
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:15,283
Save my children.

757
01:10:17,239 --> 01:10:20,619
I beg Thee, my Christ,

758
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,440
I have not damned my family.

759
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:45,527
Me lambs... me angels!

760
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,560
Mother, we have longed to see you so.

761
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:06,243
As I to thee.

762
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:13,619
I must wake thy father!
He will be so glad.

763
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:17,930
No, let him sleep.

764
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,020
We would see you oft, Mother.

765
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:47,010
- Would that please you?
- Aye.

766
01:12:48,039 --> 01:12:51,420
I have brought a book for you, Mother.

767
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,979
- Will you look at it with me?
- Aye.

768
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:58,300
Oh, one moment now. Samuel's hungry.

769
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,649
Oh, come, come, little Sam.

770
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,523
Come, come.

771
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,161
Flora? Flora?

772
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:09,500
Corruption.

773
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,170
Thou art my father.

774
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,166
What hast thou done?!

775
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:21,619
- Where are they?
- I know not what I saw.

776
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,699
- Where are they?!
- I did nothing!

777
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:27,340
- She came from the sky! She...
- Devil!

778
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:30,420
You have their blood upon thy hands!

779
01:17:34,359 --> 01:17:36,260
It is you!

780
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:39,340
- It is you!
- I am your daughter!

781
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:43,060
The Devil is in thee and have had thee.

782
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:46,979
You're smeared of his sin.
You reek of Evil!

783
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:49,699
- You've made a covenant with death!
- Mother!

784
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,659
You bewitched thy brother, proud slut!

785
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,939
Did you not think I saw
thy sluttish looks to him,

786
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:59,500
bewitching his eye as any whore?

787
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,819
- What say you to me?
- And thy father next!

788
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,002
No.

789
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,579
You took them from me!

790
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,300
- They are gone.
- No!

791
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:13,300
- You killed my children!
- No!

792
01:18:13,399 --> 01:18:16,340
You killed thy father! You witch!

793
01:18:16,439 --> 01:18:18,521
I love you! I love you!

794
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:12,684
Black Phillip,
I conjure thee to speak to me.

795
01:23:17,479 --> 01:23:20,289
Speak as thou doth speak
to Jonas and Mercy.

796
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,650
Dost thou understand my English tongue?

797
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,648
Answer me.

798
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,319
What dost thou want?

799
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,159
What canst thou give?

800
01:24:00,199 --> 01:24:04,728
Wouldst thou like the taste of butter?

801
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,881
A pretty dress?

802
01:24:09,039 --> 01:24:13,090
Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?

803
01:24:14,359 --> 01:24:15,963
Yes.

804
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:22,287
Wouldst thou like to see the world?

805
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,328
What will you from me?

806
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:32,199
Dost thou see a book before thee?

807
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,966
Remove thy shift.

808
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,002
I cannot write my name.

809
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,042
I will guide thy hand.
