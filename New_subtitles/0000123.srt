1
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:22,224
One cannot penetrate the labyrinth

2
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:25,145
by moving in a straight line.

3
00:01:09,225 --> 00:01:14,146
THE OTHERWORLD

4
00:02:50,027 --> 00:02:52,227
Here, in the south of France,

5
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:55,468
exists a web of
concentrated telluric energies.

6
00:02:56,187 --> 00:03:01,467
<i>A portal in Montségur,
Rennes-m-Chéteau and Bugarach.</i>

7
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:05,147
Together they form a gateway
to the otherworld.

8
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:16,828
Seven centuries ago,

9
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:18,948
crusaders perpetuated a genocide

10
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:21,508
against the Occitan countries
and the Cathar faith.

11
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:24,588
In 1244, they besieged Montségur

12
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:26,548
where 210 martyrs

13
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:28,708
condemned by
the Church of Rome

14
00:03:28,988 --> 00:03:30,268
died at the stake.

15
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:32,828
But their faith and occult science

16
00:03:33,108 --> 00:03:34,388
didn't die with them.

17
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:57,029
MONTSEGUR - SUMMER SOLSTICE - 2012 AD

18
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:03,388
URANIE - sorcerer

19
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:06,148
It's that time of the year when
there's a sort of portal...

20
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:09,749
A gate that might open
onto a spiritual world.

21
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:16,148
And which allows
some people who so desire

22
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:21,549
to accomplish
a transmutation. It's alchemical.

23
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,749
And it's part of a system

24
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:30,349
that was adopted by
the Cathars and the Templars

25
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:36,069
from ancient prehistoric
and megalithic sites

26
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:40,909
designed to capture and channel

27
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:44,269
the different telluric
and cosmic energies.

28
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,469
And here in Montségur,

29
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,510
the castle is built according
to a certain geometric shape

30
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,390
according to siderial geography...

31
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:04,989
It's a sort of... How can I put this?
Sort of testament they left behind.

32
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:10,150
It's a tradition that goes
way back in time.

33
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,630
And that's the Cathar heritage.

34
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,430
The Cathar Grail that was
described by Otto Rahn:

35
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,070
is the geometric
form of the castle, the way it's built,

36
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,790
the way you make
your way around it...

37
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,590
It's the geometric symbolism
of the star system,

38
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,710
the pentagram: incarnation of the flesh

39
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,591
the hexagram: the union of
heaven and earth...

40
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,471
It's very symbolic and at the same time,
it's like radionics. Waves that form shapes.

41
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:45,590
The connection has been established

42
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,351
by people who supposedly had access to
the spiritual dimension

43
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:55,271
and whose mission it was to transmit that
knowledge over time.

44
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:59,591
And speaking of
those portals or gates,

45
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:02,671
they're still very much active.

46
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:07,271
Science and all that...

47
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:11,791
That's for trying to understand

48
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,991
how all this works,

49
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,511
so as to gain access
to other worlds, you see?

50
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:19,351
It's a place where obviously,
things happen to people

51
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:21,271
who come in search of something,

52
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:22,911
like all the ones present here tonight...

53
00:06:23,191 --> 00:06:25,031
There was a time about twenty years ago

54
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:27,512
when a lot more people were present
here for the solstices.

55
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:30,672
There were Occitans, nazis, hippies...

56
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:34,271
There were Krishnas,
and even inquisitors

57
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:36,712
recognizable from
their Dominican clothing

58
00:06:36,991 --> 00:06:39,111
present hereto see
what was going on...

59
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:41,512
They were intrigued,
they were wondering

60
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,952
what so many people were doing
at Montségur, freezing their butt off

61
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:46,112
just to look at a ray of sunlight.

62
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:49,112
There are stories about solar temples

63
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,671
because this ray of light was discovered

64
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:54,112
but what was it really?
It was just a calendar

65
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:56,512
because the people who lived here,
they were peasants

66
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,032
and they needed to know
when the solstices ended

67
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:01,632
so they could plant
their seeds and things.

68
00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:04,232
There's nothing weird about it,
it's a sort of clock.

69
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:06,672
Everybody's going nuts
over this orange ray of light...

70
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:08,632
Yeah, it's a phenomenon

71
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:10,712
but that's not the point.

72
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:12,672
This is a high place

73
00:07:12,952 --> 00:07:14,712
since prehistoric times.

74
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:17,232
Every man looks to the heavens
in search of God.

75
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:20,792
You only have to look at
the starry landscape above.

76
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:22,992
People have always gathered here

77
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:25,432
because it's a high point,
it's a place full of energy

78
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,872
and submitted
to telluric forces and that's it.

79
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:32,312
There's every chance of
meeting outsiders

80
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:35,985
here whose vision and way of thinking
is similar to that of the inhabitants of Montségur.

81
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:40,672
We're here to see the sunrise tomorrow morning

82
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:44,673
and everything has been thought out,
everyone will see it...

83
00:07:44,953 --> 00:07:46,873
The sun aligns,
it lights up...

84
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,553
The ultimate goal is

85
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,952
to release our souls trapped
in our material bodies

86
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:57,353
living in this world of Satan and
ascend towards the kingdom of our Father

87
00:07:57,632 --> 00:07:59,273
of which we were born.

88
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:44,394
An old Cathar prophecy announces
that after a period of 700 years,

89
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:48,594
the laurel will turn green again
and the old ways return.

90
00:09:22,274 --> 00:09:25,594
When we come to Montségur today,
in the 21st century,

91
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:30,114
we're struck by
the magic of this place.

92
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,186
FABRICE CHAMBON - archeologist
- There's the landscape,

93
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:36,435
and this mountain dominating
the forests facing the Pyrénées

94
00:09:36,915 --> 00:09:39,715
and where sometimes birds of prey fly over.

95
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:42,434
The feeling here
is that of being out of time.

96
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:52,555
RICHARD PIGELET - curator
- The mountain of Montségur
is a very particular place.

97
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:55,755
Whichever side
you observe it from,

98
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,675
you see this emerging peak

99
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:05,595
and you feel a strong magnetic pull.

100
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,596
Just from looking at it,

101
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:12,755
you can feel this strong natural magnetism
coming off of Montségur.

102
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:14,995
There's the history of this region,

103
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:16,755
the tragedy that took place

104
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:20,116
Much can be said about
the treasure or the stake...

105
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:23,035
But you never leave this place
as you came.

106
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,996
To a lot of people,
Montségur is a solar temple.

107
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:39,636
To others,
it was a temple of worship to the Cathars.

108
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:42,836
And others still,
by touching the stones of the castle,

109
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:46,276
try to communicate
with the memory of the rocks.

110
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:50,316
Some, in a more mundane way,

111
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:52,996
come to Montségur to meditate.

112
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:55,196
And a lot has been said about Montségur

113
00:10:55,476 --> 00:10:58,036
Some even said it had
a relation with extraterrestrials.

114
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:00,796
This place is a site of pilgrimage

115
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:03,276
that attracts more and more people,

116
00:11:03,556 --> 00:11:09,716
I think it's because they
wonder about Catharism

117
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:13,076
and its still remaining mysteries.

118
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:15,556
It's on a spiritual level.

119
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:18,156
I think they're looking for understanding.

120
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:20,997
Montségur is a place of initiation.

121
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,892
TRISTAN BERGEROT - founder espritcathare.org
- People come to Montségur in search of answers

122
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:26,236
to their past, to their future

123
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:27,797
and to their present.

124
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:30,837
They identify with
the history of the Cathars,

125
00:11:31,677 --> 00:11:34,917
a history worthy of
a novel or a movie.

126
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:37,837
You get the feeling
that everything was predestined.

127
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:50,077
You can feel people
searching for something

128
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:51,957
inside themselves,

129
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:54,357
as if this place called

130
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:57,797
for instrospection of the self.

131
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:01,438
The height of the mountain

132
00:12:01,998 --> 00:12:06,357
symbolizes the union
of heaven and earth.

133
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:11,038
As in all civilizations, it's the
dwelling place of the gods.

134
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,677
It's where man rises up,

135
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:18,117
where he has the possibility
to rise toward God.

136
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:22,278
As you can see,
this place is no simple castle.

137
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:24,878
It's not just an historical site.

138
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:28,357
We're in a place that holds a lot of depth
and importance to many people.

139
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,398
AIMEE COUQUET - inhabitant of Montségur

140
00:13:06,678 --> 00:13:10,198
Many people hold magical rituals up there.

141
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:15,199
Sects still come here to
practice magical rites.

142
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:28,919
SCARLETT AMARIS - author & esoteric researcher

143
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:20,501
We know that the Cathars

144
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:22,620
- and this is very innovative -

145
00:17:22,899 --> 00:17:25,259
did not discriminate between women and men.

146
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:27,977
There's a woman from here
who's very famous,

147
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:30,656
she was the sister of the Count of Foix
and her name was Esclarmonde

148
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:33,175
Ever since she was a child,

149
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:38,532
she was surrounded
by poets, troubadours and musicians

150
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:43,129
so she was very gifted, very intelligent.

151
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,689
When the troubadours

152
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:46,369
sang about Esclarmonde,

153
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:48,487
they praised the beauty of this woman

154
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:54,564
but not just her physical beauty,
her inner beauty as well.

155
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:04,679
She allowed the fortification of Montségur

156
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,556
so as to be able to receive the Cathars
fleeing from the Inquisition at the time.

157
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:15,634
When the Northern Crusaders arrived
in Languedoc, arms in hand,

158
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:17,673
they were very surprised

159
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:20,512
by the freedom women had here.

160
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:23,791
They were astonished to see
women commanding men.

161
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:29,828
Countesses of Comminges commandeering their
troops.

162
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:34,985
There were women,
as in Montségur, who took up arms.

163
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:37,784
They were like Occitan
Joan of Arcs.

164
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:45,181
Esclarmonde died in 1240

165
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,739
and didn't witness the fall of Montségur.

166
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,056
What's interesting about Catharism

167
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:57,055
is the great role played by women.

168
00:18:57,335 --> 00:19:01,253
One might say that
without the Cathar women,

169
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:05,011
catharism wouldn't have scared
the Roman church so much.

170
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:08,849
One might extrapolate even further.

171
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:11,288
Maybe the crusades
never would've existed.

172
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:17,406
It was the women who really shook
the Roman church in its beliefs.

173
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:12,791
Beyond that,
it's interesting to note

174
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:18,788
that when prehistoric people depicted
human beings, they were always women.

175
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:30,302
The most beautiful examples
of ancient findings

176
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:36,420
were discovered by archaeologists
deep in the caves of the Pyrenees

177
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:39,738
and they're called
“Mother Goddesses”.

178
00:21:40,018 --> 00:21:42,697
They're small statuettes

179
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:47,255
and form the first known traces
of art created by humanity.

180
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:53,651
Today, even in novels, when Cathar women

181
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:56,490
and Esclarmonde are mentioned,

182
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,088
it's obviously a direct reference
to the worship of womanhood

183
00:22:01,128 --> 00:22:03,207
that still exists
in the Pyrénées today.

184
00:22:57,221 --> 00:23:01,859
Like I said, the castle of Montségur
is the grail itself.

185
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:08,616
It holds the keys to the architecture
and the network

186
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:12,974
in place since prehistoric times.

187
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:24,528
THE DEVIL'S CHAIR - RENNES-LES-BAINS

188
00:23:46,438 --> 00:23:49,397
We don't know why there's a pentacle,
why there's a hexagram...

189
00:23:49,676 --> 00:23:52,355
In fact, nobody really knows.

190
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:06,588
Those are astronomical markers
for certain periods of time...

191
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,706
that coincide with...

192
00:24:12,106 --> 00:24:15,624
the places built on telluric
and cosmic landmarks.

193
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:21,901
THE CIRCLES SPRING

194
00:24:30,577 --> 00:24:33,336
It's the heritage.
In that sense, it is the grail.

195
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:38,093
The Grail isn't hidden somewhere. It's not about
blowing up Montségur in order to find it.

196
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:40,412
The grail is the castle itself.

197
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:55,205
So, if you have some time
on your hands

198
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:58,044
and you don't know what to do,
you can take a map

199
00:24:58,324 --> 00:25:02,722
and trace lines accordingly
and see what turns up.

200
00:25:03,642 --> 00:25:06,400
<i>So, Hook a map</i>

201
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,918
of the surroundings and the castle...

202
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:15,796
And I thought to myself, if there's
something to be found,

203
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:20,153
it must be accessible for everyone,
more or less,

204
00:25:20,993 --> 00:25:22,393
by easy means.

205
00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:26,190
Not everybody's a freemason
of the 33rd degree and carries knowledge

206
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,270
of all the arcana of sacred geometry.

207
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:33,307
And my first thought was Rennes-le-Chéteau,
Rennes-les-Bains.

208
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:38,465
So I said to myself that I'd
trace a circle, just out of curiosity...

209
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:42,023
I took the church of Rennes-le-Chéteau
and put my compass here, hop,

210
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:47,381
The church of Rennes-les-Bains, toc

211
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,539
We try to make it somewhat precise,
since we're going at it...

212
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:54,737
And I traced the circle, simply enough.

213
00:25:57,216 --> 00:25:59,975
This is when I realized
that the circle...

214
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:02,973
was connecting
with Campagne-les-Bains

215
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:06,532
to the ancient Templar fortress
and the church...

216
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:09,611
I traced the line and...

217
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:12,090
The first evident line that stuck out was

218
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:14,488
the radius connecting
Rennes-le-Chéteau / Rennes-les-Bains

219
00:26:14,768 --> 00:26:16,527
And so I traced...

220
00:26:16,887 --> 00:26:22,764
And I thought to myself, well, these things
have stumbled upon themselves nicely.

221
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:26,282
I then pursued from Rennes-les-Bains, hop...
and kept the same radius...

222
00:26:26,562 --> 00:26:29,241
Without changing it...
And I then traced what they call

223
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,318
the Vesica Pisces shape
in the construction lingo.

224
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:39,876
And now, we trace
from Rennes-les-Bains...

225
00:26:40,556 --> 00:26:44,274
And I realized that churches of
Rennes-les-Bains and Bézu.

226
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:46,873
Were connected
on the same radius.

227
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,311
Well, hum, a whole new coincidence...

228
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:52,510
Four churches that connect
just by making one tracing like that...

229
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:58,067
Which made in turn, a composite

230
00:26:58,947 --> 00:27:01,266
of two hexagrams...

231
00:27:02,465 --> 00:27:06,743
with a slight offset, which allowed me
to draw a twelve-branch star.

232
00:27:07,223 --> 00:27:10,462
Drawing this shape
led me to discover other points

233
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:13,620
and little by little,
that's how it developed.

234
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,979
And I realized that
in relation to my place...

235
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:18,018
URANIE'S PROPERTY

236
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:21,297
...on my property, there are landmarks

237
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:26,374
relating to the phases of
the solstice and the equinox...

238
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:29,653
So, I had my three axis seen from here

239
00:27:30,093 --> 00:27:32,851
which were already included
in a figure because...

240
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,409
That's sort of the shrewdness...

241
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:40,447
If you begin this personal research
because that's what it is...

242
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:45,045
Nobody else can make it for you...

243
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:48,963
Tracing...
You have to do it on your own... to see.

244
00:27:49,243 --> 00:27:51,122
Already, when we trace,

245
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:54,081
we find things we can't explain!

246
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,119
And we realize that these
shapes are alive.

247
00:27:59,718 --> 00:28:02,876
They're active.
They act on the spirit.

248
00:28:03,397 --> 00:28:07,114
There's always a moment when
something will happen,

249
00:28:07,714 --> 00:28:10,433
that'll lead you to discover a new figure
made by mistake.

250
00:28:10,713 --> 00:28:13,392
And I've made lots of mistakes.

251
00:28:13,871 --> 00:28:16,630
And found lots of things
by making errors in my angles...

252
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:20,069
I would be tracing one figure
and end up drawing another!

253
00:28:22,987 --> 00:28:25,626
So yeah, some things
happen on their own

254
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:27,985
because this site remains active.

255
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:34,981
RENNES-LE-CHATEAU - SUMMER 2012

256
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:00,849
(Latin) This place is to be feared, this is
the house of God and the Gate to Heaven.

257
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:04,447
CHURCH OF THE HOLY MARY-MAGDALENE

258
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:21,279
The church is dedicated to Mary Magdalene
who is another manifestation of the Goddess.

259
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,318
The first ray of sun on the 17th of January
illuminates the edifice.

260
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,590
In the nineteenth century,
Abbé Bérenger Saunière

261
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:45,548
allegedly uncovered a fabulous treasure

262
00:29:46,028 --> 00:29:47,907
that made him immensely wealthy.

263
00:29:58,262 --> 00:30:00,981
He built this place
following an occult concept

264
00:30:01,261 --> 00:30:03,300
and took the secret to his grave.

265
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:12,015
This mystery fed
a prosperous commercial industry

266
00:30:12,295 --> 00:30:14,870
ranging from "The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail"
to the "DaVinci Code".

267
00:30:35,685 --> 00:30:38,443
ALAIN X - Stone Mason
-'Rennes-le-Chéteau is a place...

268
00:30:40,602 --> 00:30:44,321
that can be as beneficial
as negative.

269
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,239
ALEX PAINCO - Mayor of Rennes-le-Chateau
-Rennes-le-Chéteau is an old village,

270
00:30:48,238 --> 00:30:49,758
an historical village

271
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:51,677
and it has changed a lot

272
00:30:51,957 --> 00:30:54,276
since the arrival of
Abbé Saunière in 1885.

273
00:30:56,434 --> 00:31:02,192
Abbé Saunière has built
a lot of edifices here

274
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:05,870
and that's where the mystery of
Rennes-le-Chéteau springs from.

275
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:11,787
Rennes-le-Chateau is a place of initiation.

276
00:31:12,387 --> 00:31:14,786
Not everybody
can just go into this.

277
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,140
The elders knew
that Hell had seven gates.

278
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:31,858
Each one has a guardian
worse than the other.

279
00:31:32,497 --> 00:31:34,777
It's only by passing
through these gates

280
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:37,376
that we can escape the hell
of the material world.

281
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:40,294
Or bring heaven
down to earth.

282
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:09,000
ARTUR SALA - physicist

283
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:23,953
And the horror movies?

284
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:28,751
The Fulci films? The Italian horror films?

285
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:34,748
Yeah. That's what opened the door for me.

286
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:38,227
The gates of Hell?

287
00:32:38,986 --> 00:32:39,746
Yes.

288
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:44,144
Rennes-le-Chéteau is...

289
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,463
It's special...

290
00:32:46,743 --> 00:32:49,421
It's a place where you can
either lose your soul or rise.

291
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,460
It's... it's a labyrinth like the ones

292
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:58,097
that exist in old cathedrals,
built by our ancestors...

293
00:33:01,775 --> 00:33:04,454
With hidden pits and traps...

294
00:33:05,614 --> 00:33:09,371
We get a lot of tourists here,
about 120,000 each year.

295
00:33:10,811 --> 00:33:13,209
For such a small village

296
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,208
with eighteen year-round inhabitants,
ten shops is a lot.

297
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:20,926
So we can say tourism is what makes
Rennes-le-Chéteau live.

298
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:24,245
Rennes-le-Chéteau is like a spiderweb
with a spider in the middle.

299
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:28,203
It's gigantic but invisible
at the same time.

300
00:33:28,803 --> 00:33:33,000
And the people who come here
should know that they're like flies.

301
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,999
If they get caught in the web,

302
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,318
well... They get eaten.

303
00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:42,996
Thanks to Abbé Saunière,
the mystery lives on.

304
00:33:44,036 --> 00:33:45,874
Researchers come here,

305
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:49,033
several movies have been
made about this place...

306
00:33:49,992 --> 00:33:52,392
...Numerous books have been
written, about 600 until now.

307
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:55,550
Rennes-le-Chéteau has
become internationally known,

308
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:59,548
since Abbé Saunière came here.

309
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:04,586
When you set out in your path of initiation,
when you travel around France...

310
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:07,424
...It's up to you not to stumble

311
00:34:07,704 --> 00:34:09,583
and keep walking on the right path

312
00:34:09,863 --> 00:34:12,182
to become what is known
as a "companion".

313
00:34:12,942 --> 00:34:15,220
If you're not capable
of being a companion,

314
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,819
if you can't get rid of...

315
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:21,817
If y0u're just bait and y0u're incapable
of seeing the apprentice side of things,

316
00:34:22,097 --> 00:34:24,496
You can't be a companion.
You're not part of the companionship

317
00:34:24,776 --> 00:34:27,175
in Rennes-le-Chéteau,
it's as simple as that.

318
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:29,293
For the people to understand.

319
00:34:54,522 --> 00:34:56,801
It comes from ancient times,

320
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:59,000
it's from a lost world

321
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,358
of gates and...

322
00:35:03,198 --> 00:35:04,997
For the people to understand.

323
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:06,676
<i>I</i> mean...

324
00:35:08,115 --> 00:35:10,154
For the people who come here,

325
00:35:11,114 --> 00:35:13,193
the ones seeking something,

326
00:35:13,593 --> 00:35:15,792
it's up to them not to get lost.

327
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,670
That's all I have to say.

328
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:26,347
If some people lose themselves
here in Rennes-le-Chéteau,

329
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:28,945
others come to seek answers.

330
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,785
That was the case
of François Mitterrand

331
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:34,383
who came here a few days
before the election

332
00:35:34,863 --> 00:35:37,262
on a very mysterious visit.

333
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:49,936
As for Mitterand's visit
to Rennes-le-Chéteau,

334
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,534
ANDRE GALLAUD - Journalist
-it didn't go exactly the way it's described

335
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:55,173
in the books or
the movies made about it.

336
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:58,931
It happened during
the presidential campaign

337
00:35:59,211 --> 00:36:01,610
that took place in the
month of May, 1981.

338
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,728
Mitterrand was asked

339
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:07,528
to come to Couiza

340
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:10,326
to present himself to the people here.

341
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:13,204
As tradition has it,

342
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:15,803
a great dinner was held
at the village hall.

343
00:36:16,723 --> 00:36:19,082
After the dinner was over,

344
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:21,601
president Robert Capdeville

345
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,560
turns to Mitterrand and
asks him if all is well

346
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,759
and Mitterand responds in form...

347
00:36:27,038 --> 00:36:29,237
Capdeville then says
“Listen, if it's all right with you

348
00:36:29,517 --> 00:36:31,716
and in order to properly
digest this excellent meal,

349
00:36:31,995 --> 00:36:33,395
I would like to show you a site

350
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:35,034
that you’ll remember.

351
00:36:35,314 --> 00:36:36,913
Instead of your usual walk,

352
00:36:37,193 --> 00:36:39,512
I'll take you up
to Rennes-le-Chéteau...

353
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:42,071
So they went up
to Rennes-le-Chéteau,

354
00:36:42,351 --> 00:36:46,669
They were welcomed by
the departmental councilor and the mayor.

355
00:36:47,228 --> 00:36:53,466
Mitterrand then discovered this site
and was amazed by the view

356
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:56,304
and What the Abbé had built,

357
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:58,783
but there was never any question

358
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:01,382
about a treasure or anything like that.

359
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:09,818
After walking around a bit, Mitterrand
wanted to see the Magdala Tower.

360
00:37:10,298 --> 00:37:14,055
So we came up here and he
climbed to the top of the Tower

361
00:37:14,335 --> 00:37:15,535
and he was...

362
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:18,334
He was completely
in awe with the view.

363
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:20,293
That was that.

364
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:23,492
That was the way Mitterrand's
visit to the department of Aude,

365
00:37:23,772 --> 00:37:26,770
Couiza and
Rennes-le-Chéteau went.

366
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:29,609
It all happened very simply,

367
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:32,287
it was mostly a digestive walk.

368
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:37,924
As history has it,
something happened here a few years back.

369
00:37:38,204 --> 00:37:41,403
The mirror downstairs
is not the original one.

370
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:43,923
What happened was

371
00:37:44,203 --> 00:37:46,443
that several youngsters
came up here,

372
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:49,042
one of which was the owner's daughter.

373
00:37:49,923 --> 00:37:52,322
They looked into the mirror
and saw the Devil.

374
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:56,123
They were scared
out of their wits.

375
00:37:56,403 --> 00:38:00,122
And they ended up at my place.
The only time they ever came here...!

376
00:38:00,883 --> 00:38:03,883
They told me they'd seen
the Devil in the mirror.

377
00:38:05,602 --> 00:38:07,122
And it reminded me

378
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:09,322
of what one of the early
researchers told me,

379
00:38:09,602 --> 00:38:11,242
a guy named Jean Pelé.

380
00:38:11,883 --> 00:38:15,723
He said he knew about formulas
to call up the Devil in mirrors.

381
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:18,963
He had taught this formula
to certain people

382
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:21,923
and now regretted it because
they'd abused it.

383
00:38:23,563 --> 00:38:25,843
And what probably happened back then,

384
00:38:26,123 --> 00:38:28,443
I think that the people who lived here...

385
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:31,043
...used those formulas

386
00:38:31,323 --> 00:38:34,883
and opened a gate, toc,
through the mirror...

387
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:37,283
and saw the Devil.

388
00:38:37,603 --> 00:38:39,803
But they weren't prepared for it.

389
00:38:40,442 --> 00:38:43,202
And I'm the one who broke
that mirror when I came here

390
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:45,843
in the early nineties...

391
00:38:49,723 --> 00:38:52,122
...to do a sort of purification...

392
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:56,043
Because it was so loaded that
something had to be done.

393
00:38:56,883 --> 00:39:00,003
And this mirror had
an importance in history.

394
00:39:00,323 --> 00:39:02,723
I don't really know
the bottom of the story,

395
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:05,803
what happened then...
But point being, I broke it!

396
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,163
And so I closed the door for this devil.

397
00:39:12,122 --> 00:39:14,403
When you dine with the Devil,
you better have a big spoon

398
00:39:14,683 --> 00:39:17,003
otherwise...
you don't eat.

399
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,925
And since this place is a sort

400
00:39:45,205 --> 00:39:47,526
of spider web, you know,
it's like a spider...

401
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:54,006
This is sort of the center where impulses

402
00:39:54,287 --> 00:39:56,527
are received from various places...

403
00:39:56,807 --> 00:39:58,007
URANIE'S HOUSE

404
00:39:58,287 --> 00:40:01,087
...from as far away as England
or maybe even further...

405
00:40:01,687 --> 00:40:04,888
...it's the whole network that's used...

406
00:40:05,688 --> 00:40:09,608
And over the course of history in
Rennes-le-Chéteau and the area of La Coume...

407
00:40:09,888 --> 00:40:12,128
URANIE'S CAT

408
00:40:13,888 --> 00:40:16,289
I can say that there
have been lots of assaults...

409
00:40:17,129 --> 00:40:19,529
...a lot of things done to destroy...

410
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:22,890
this place, the community
and the people who live here.

411
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:26,609
I've made all this over time and it's...

412
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:30,290
Well, there's no artistic purpose

413
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,930
in exhibiting works with a "vision"...!

414
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,171
The ultimate goal is

415
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:38,451
to balance the energies

416
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:41,051
so all this has been
made little by little,

417
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:43,771
during certain periods,
moments, certain phases...

418
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:45,891
...over time.

419
00:40:46,172 --> 00:40:48,171
It has a therapeutic purpose.

420
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:50,292
Magico-therapy.

421
00:40:50,572 --> 00:40:55,372
To balance energies
and avoid taking too much in.

422
00:40:55,772 --> 00:40:57,652
They're like shields.

423
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,061
URANIE'S NEIGHBOR - corporate CEO Jaap
Rameijer

424
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:36,261
JAAP'S HOUSE

425
00:42:48,223 --> 00:42:51,463
JAAP'S CAT

426
00:46:29,283 --> 00:46:31,923
JAAP'S VIDEO - LES LABADOUS - SUMMER 2012

427
00:46:49,325 --> 00:46:51,245
It's...

428
00:46:58,286 --> 00:47:01,006
To really understand Rennes-le-Chéteau

429
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:04,446
one must come here,
look around...

430
00:47:05,966 --> 00:47:08,727
And then one must check out a map.

431
00:47:09,886 --> 00:47:11,926
If you have
Rennes-les-Bains here...

432
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:14,167
Rennes-le-Chéteau there...

433
00:47:14,447 --> 00:47:16,367
And draw the equilateral triangle...

434
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:19,327
Then you only have to look out
the window and see what there is.

435
00:47:20,807 --> 00:47:22,688
If you look hard enough,

436
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:26,288
you can see a farm
called Le Carla.

437
00:47:27,168 --> 00:47:30,408
If we divide this in half...
And take the bisector...

438
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,408
Le Carla is at this precise spot.

439
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:40,049
It's a very particular geometric shape

440
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,330
If you look at the bottom of those rocks...

441
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:49,330
Just at the edge of the field,
there's a tiny red spot.

442
00:47:54,931 --> 00:47:59,291
All that's needed is a little
bit of phonetic Cabala

443
00:47:59,611 --> 00:48:02,371
to make an anagram of Carla

444
00:48:09,492 --> 00:48:13,492
So, toc, what does Sauniere show us?
The Grail.

445
00:48:14,452 --> 00:48:17,413
It's a nice gift, isn't it?

446
00:48:18,453 --> 00:48:19,933
And then I discovered...

447
00:48:20,853 --> 00:48:23,413
...that a shape appears here...

448
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:32,854
...of a woman's head...

449
00:48:34,855 --> 00:48:37,534
...right in the axis of
the rising sun and

450
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:40,215
leading straight
to Le Carla.

451
00:48:40,494 --> 00:48:43,135
Le Carla can be seen
from the Magdala Tower.

452
00:48:43,415 --> 00:48:46,535
Let's see what Saunière
might have wanted to tell us

453
00:48:46,815 --> 00:48:49,135
if it had any such intentions...

454
00:48:49,415 --> 00:48:52,936
It's the alignment of this ramp knob

455
00:48:54,256 --> 00:48:59,897
with the middle of the window, the
church window that has been placed here...

456
00:49:01,577 --> 00:49:05,297
And if we align the two...

457
00:49:06,137 --> 00:49:09,658
We end up on the cave of Mary Magdalene.

458
00:49:09,938 --> 00:49:12,818
It used to be the Fournet Cave but
it has been renamed to Mary Magdalene.

459
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:20,499
I think it used to be
an ancient celtic or druidic site,

460
00:49:20,779 --> 00:49:26,099
where certain initiations
or rituals took place...

461
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:30,699
There's all this symbolism
of fecundity,

462
00:49:30,979 --> 00:49:34,060
death and rebirth
related to caves.

463
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:38,020
And we can see on the church's altar

464
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,500
a painting of Mary Magdalene in the cave...

465
00:49:46,661 --> 00:49:49,941
It's always been a place where

466
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:53,862
groups of people
come to do rituals... It's always active.

467
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:58,582
There seems to be a certain
specificity to this place

468
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:02,462
in that it has this sort
of incubating role...

469
00:50:02,743 --> 00:50:06,743
in the practices of certain occult groups

470
00:50:07,023 --> 00:50:13,023
surrounding the culture of
succubi and incubi and other spirits...

471
00:50:13,304 --> 00:50:18,344
These people are trying to get
women to copulate with the incubi

472
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:22,665
in order to give birth
to fantastical creatures.

473
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:26,185
Legend has it that Mérovée,

474
00:50:26,465 --> 00:50:30,145
the first Merovingian king,

475
00:50:30,425 --> 00:50:33,825
was the son of a witch
and a succubus.

476
00:50:34,105 --> 00:50:36,346
Just like Merlin the enchanter.

477
00:50:36,626 --> 00:50:43,666
So there's a persistent underlying
base in Rennes-le-Chéteau

478
00:50:44,066 --> 00:50:48,667
where there's a lot of ceremonials
and sexual rituals that are carried out

479
00:50:48,947 --> 00:50:55,708
in order to incarnate spirits
that are believed to be superior.

480
00:51:11,278 --> 00:51:17,283
I hope the village
will stay as it is, pretty and peaceful,

481
00:51:17,704 --> 00:51:22,239
and keep attracting
tourists, but normal ones.

482
00:51:25,052 --> 00:51:27,446
I've had a lot of
administrative problems

483
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,679
such as obtaining
a building permit...

484
00:51:31,351 --> 00:51:35,047
...of conformity...
Right now, I'm living here

485
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:43,361
as an outlaw since my house isn't in
accordance with sanitary regulations.

486
00:51:44,663 --> 00:51:49,073
Three years ago, we surprised several
people digging beneath the cemetary.

487
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:51,340
They were caught in time.

488
00:51:51,634 --> 00:51:54,700
I receive mail from people telling me
that Jesus is no longer buried here,

489
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:57,639
but is buried in Bayonne.

490
00:51:57,933 --> 00:52:01,250
People who believe that the
body of Jesus is in the church

491
00:52:01,544 --> 00:52:04,231
or that they've uncovered
the treasure...

492
00:52:04,525 --> 00:52:08,515
-- people who believe that Mary Magdalene
is buried beneath the village --...

493
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:12,379
It took me twelve years,
twelve years and three internments...

494
00:52:13,512 --> 00:52:17,459
...to get the whole property back.

495
00:52:19,307 --> 00:52:23,254
Plus the problems... The worries...

496
00:52:26,362 --> 00:52:28,924
Everything you can imagine...

497
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,921
...all the things that happen
when the powers that be

498
00:52:34,215 --> 00:52:37,784
have decided to
destroy your life.

499
00:52:40,807 --> 00:52:43,411
Things like isolation...

500
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:47,610
Total isolation, separation
from friends and family...

501
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:53,112
No more means,
no car, nothing...

502
00:52:53,406 --> 00:52:56,261
Loss of income, the maximum in other words.

503
00:52:56,555 --> 00:53:00,418
We've also had Jesus himself
stop by at the mayor's office,

504
00:53:00,797 --> 00:53:03,652
some guy
claiming to be Jesus.

505
00:53:04,366 --> 00:53:06,088
It's fabulous.

506
00:53:07,095 --> 00:53:09,279
I filed a complaint...
They said I was right.

507
00:53:09,573 --> 00:53:12,806
And then they measured
up the terrain

508
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,719
and to tell me I was right,
they went toc, and reclaimed some of it!

509
00:53:18,013 --> 00:53:23,389
So, yeah. It's that type of
administrative harassment...

510
00:53:23,683 --> 00:53:27,546
But we can't say they did it on purpose.
I don't know.

511
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,661
We can say it's a mistake, at least, that's
what they told me after twelve years.

512
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:35,818
“We're sorry, we made a mistake”.
They still confined me three times

513
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:40,060
to a mental hospital
with chemical treatment.

514
00:53:40,437 --> 00:53:43,881
That's not nothing.
It's not an easy situation.

515
00:53:44,175 --> 00:53:47,871
I still have treatments with a psychiatrist.
It's three months in a hospital.

516
00:53:48,164 --> 00:53:51,649
And then it's three months of therapy...

517
00:53:51,943 --> 00:53:55,512
...and injections of psychotropic substances.
In my case it was Aldol.

518
00:53:55,806 --> 00:53:58,872
Generally, I just turn them back nicely

519
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:01,853
by saying that Rennes-le-Chateau
wants to remain a peaceful place...

520
00:54:02,147 --> 00:54:06,012
So that these types of people
can just go away and not stay here.

521
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:10,546
Then there were the direct threats
on my life, death threats. Obvious ones.

522
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:16,761
And several misguided attempts

523
00:54:18,231 --> 00:54:20,163
to eliminate me.

524
00:54:23,102 --> 00:54:25,118
Physically.

525
00:54:25,706 --> 00:54:28,393
There are quite a few people

526
00:54:28,687 --> 00:54:31,375
who are a little “special”,
one might say..

527
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:34,608
But they're mostly
in Bugarach

528
00:54:39,984 --> 00:54:43,805
To me, Rennes-le-Chéteau
was the precursor

529
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:46,745
to the Bugarach phenomenon.

530
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,765
BUGARACH - SUMMER 2012

531
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,355
JEAN-PIERRE DELORD - mayor of Bugarach
- We're all a little weird...

532
00:55:06,649 --> 00:55:09,799
People come here
with their own beliefs...

533
00:55:10,092 --> 00:55:14,879
This is a democracy where people are free
to think and believe as they want.

534
00:55:15,173 --> 00:55:18,029
I have no problem with people
coming here on a pilgrimage

535
00:55:18,323 --> 00:55:21,346
or searching for something else.

536
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,252
My problem is if having too many of
them here at once.

537
00:55:25,546 --> 00:55:28,863
36 years as the mayor.

538
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:32,264
It's a job like any other.

539
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:35,456
It's like being the chief tribesman.

540
00:55:36,883 --> 00:55:38,564
But it's okay.

541
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:41,671
Two hundred people to care for...

542
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,652
A superb countryside and...

543
00:55:45,282 --> 00:55:46,164
that!

544
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:47,676
Fantastic!

545
00:55:49,691 --> 00:55:52,169
That mountain is particular.

546
00:55:53,261 --> 00:55:57,208
We can already see it by its shape
and placement.

547
00:55:57,502 --> 00:56:01,450
It's particular because
geologically speaking,

548
00:56:01,744 --> 00:56:04,599
all the layers are reversed.

549
00:56:05,187 --> 00:56:09,764
If you consult a compass...

550
00:56:10,436 --> 00:56:15,391
there's a definite discrepancy. There must
be a very large mass of iron underneath.

551
00:56:16,189 --> 00:56:19,338
I tell everybody to
"Get up there and you'll see,

552
00:56:19,632 --> 00:56:21,648
you’ll come down different”.

553
00:56:21,942 --> 00:56:25,050
Some never get fully back
down, they stay perched up there!

554
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:11,662
The truth is that when
I heard about this event,

555
00:57:11,956 --> 00:57:20,984
I notified the prefectoral authorities so
they'd take an interest in the phenomena.

556
00:57:21,446 --> 00:57:27,745
In turn, they notified MIVILUDES, the government
department that monitors cult activity

557
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:31,776
and which have investigated
the three regional divisions around here.

558
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:34,968
They indeed thought there was
something going on

559
00:57:35,262 --> 00:57:40,049
and following that discovery, the prefect
decided to put this place under surveillance.

560
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:45,382
Maybe they'll call in the military.
There's always that possibility.

561
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:53,319
JEROME VIGUIER - mountain guide
- The mayor's office and the mayor in particular

562
00:57:53,613 --> 00:57:56,426
is very down to earth.
So he's probably afraid

563
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,030
that people are going to climb
the mountain of Bugarach

564
00:57:59,324 --> 00:58:01,970
and throw themselves
into a vortex or portal.

565
00:58:02,264 --> 00:58:06,295
When the month of December is over,
they'll just find another date to hold on to.

566
00:58:06,589 --> 00:58:09,066
They'll all look like idiots.

567
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,636
That's what I believe.
It's all bogus stuff.

568
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:14,484
It's a complete delirium.

569
00:58:14,946 --> 00:58:17,759
I still have my feet firmly planted
on the ground, I'm not gone yet!

570
00:58:18,977 --> 00:58:21,538
If I'd wanted to set

571
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,142
all this up myself...

572
00:58:24,436 --> 00:58:26,284
Already, with an advertising agency,

573
00:58:26,578 --> 00:58:29,895
it would've cost me a fortune.

574
00:58:30,189 --> 00:58:33,002
It probably wouldn't have
had the same impact.

575
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:36,320
I'm completely baffled...

576
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:38,923
by the proportions
this fad has taken.

577
00:58:39,217 --> 00:58:45,978
Of course, these stories about the end
of the world periodically resurface.

578
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:49,926
We humans are haunted
by the demise of our planet.

579
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,941
I think the real problem
lies therein.

580
00:59:20,496 --> 00:59:22,302
One night, it must've
been around 2 a.m.

581
00:59:22,596 --> 00:59:24,947
I was spending the night
in a cave with friends...

582
00:59:25,703 --> 00:59:27,845
Just near its entrance.

583
00:59:28,223 --> 00:59:32,212
And around 2 a.m.,
I woke up for no reason.

584
00:59:33,346 --> 00:59:35,782
And I saw this huge
white light outside.

585
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:38,511
It filled up the whole
entrance to the cave

586
00:59:38,805 --> 00:59:40,611
which must've been...

587
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:44,516
30-50 feet wide.

588
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:47,876
I didn't have the presence of mind
to get up and check it out.

589
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:51,193
The next morning,
I talked it over with my friends

590
00:59:51,739 --> 00:59:55,182
and one of them said
he'd seen the same thing.

591
00:59:56,190 --> 01:00:00,515
Like me, he didn't get up
to see what was going on but...

592
01:00:01,985 --> 01:00:05,428
A great white light...
On a moonless night.

593
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:10,005
We were far from the road
so it couldn't have been car lights.

594
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,702
The mystery remains.

595
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,236
The story stems from a character who lived
- he's passed on, now -

596
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:22,016
he lived near the "Source Salée" domain
on the edge of the village...

597
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:26,173
He claimed to hear

598
01:00:26,887 --> 01:00:30,330
humming coming from a cave

599
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:33,648
and believed the sound was coming from

600
01:00:33,942 --> 01:00:37,343
an underground garage where

601
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,122
they repaired flying saucers, etc...

602
01:00:41,501 --> 01:00:44,188
The myth started from this.

603
01:00:44,482 --> 01:00:47,421
It got in print in UFO magazines

604
01:00:47,715 --> 01:00:51,075
and then the story
came back on the internet, etc, etc.

605
01:01:05,772 --> 01:01:09,720
A trekker took this picture
in Montferrier in 1976...

606
01:01:10,055 --> 01:01:13,499
It shows a flying saucer that

607
01:01:13,919 --> 01:01:17,363
supposedly appeared
in the sky one morning.

608
01:01:17,866 --> 01:01:21,310
The picture has never been
authenticated by professionals

609
01:01:21,687 --> 01:01:25,132
so nobody knows
whether it's fake or not.

610
01:01:25,845 --> 01:01:29,204
The person whose idea it was

611
01:01:29,498 --> 01:01:32,732
to print a postcard
representing a flying saucer

612
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:35,377
is a photographer

613
01:01:35,671 --> 01:01:39,031
who lives one village over.

614
01:01:39,408 --> 01:01:44,700
He sold it to us.

615
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:51,629
There's another postcard with a small
blue-green creature next to the peak

616
01:01:51,922 --> 01:01:54,065
who's obviously
an extraterrestrial.

617
01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:58,222
Some people firmly believe that Montségur
is an extraterrestrial landing base.

618
01:01:58,516 --> 01:02:02,547
There was this group who came in
with all sorts of electronic equipment

619
01:02:02,841 --> 01:02:06,200
and who set up antennaes
all over the mountain.

620
01:02:06,494 --> 01:02:09,728
So l went up to them
to ask what was going on...

621
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:15,481
They told me they were communicating with
extraterrestrials who were living inside the mountain.

622
01:02:15,769 --> 01:02:18,969
I have a lot of friends who are
very much in touch with Nature...

623
01:02:22,609 --> 01:02:32,369
They see faeries, gnomes and goblins
in Bugarach. All sorts of phenomena.

624
01:03:52,052 --> 01:03:53,852
You pass through a gate

625
01:03:54,132 --> 01:03:56,492
where you see
all things material

626
01:03:56,772 --> 01:04:01,132
such as houses, standing stones,
dolmens, trees, hills, mountains, earth...

627
01:04:01,932 --> 01:04:03,452
That's what you see.

628
01:04:03,733 --> 01:04:07,092
And then, there's another gate

629
01:04:07,372 --> 01:04:09,852
where you hear voices,
sounds of horses,

630
01:04:10,132 --> 01:04:12,613
but you can't
communicate with them.

631
01:04:12,893 --> 01:04:14,413
It's as if they don't see you at all.

632
01:04:14,693 --> 01:04:17,092
All the places like that,
like in Montségur, are doors.

633
01:04:17,372 --> 01:04:20,772
There are certain periods of
the year when those energies

634
01:04:21,813 --> 01:04:24,133
are more active than at others...

635
01:04:24,813 --> 01:04:27,493
It's a sort of...

636
01:04:28,572 --> 01:04:31,093
it's a celestial gate...

637
01:04:31,373 --> 01:04:33,133
and at the same time infernal.

638
01:04:35,733 --> 01:04:38,414
Because it's also a gateway to Hell.

639
01:04:39,053 --> 01:04:41,174
If you invoke the Devil
here, no problem,

640
01:04:41,454 --> 01:04:46,374
he'll show up and
ask you what you want.

641
01:04:49,013 --> 01:04:50,133
In general, when
passing through a gate,

642
01:04:51,694 --> 01:04:53,854
there's a mix of the past,

643
01:04:54,134 --> 01:04:56,734
the present and the future.

644
01:04:58,534 --> 01:04:59,894
Let's say that,

645
01:05:00,174 --> 01:05:01,934
a few years back,

646
01:05:03,654 --> 01:05:07,334
I had an intense experience
about Montségur.

647
01:05:08,134 --> 01:05:10,814
I came across a book
about the Cathars

648
01:05:12,175 --> 01:05:14,095
which I'd never
heard about before.

649
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:18,975
When I looked at the cover picture
of Montségur, I had a revelation.

650
01:05:19,535 --> 01:05:21,735
I think I may have lived
a previous life here.

651
01:05:22,015 --> 01:05:24,855
The first time I went to Montségur,
I remembered who I was...

652
01:05:25,135 --> 01:05:27,615
I don't know...

653
01:05:27,895 --> 01:05:30,294
They say that before you die, all
the important things in your life

654
01:05:30,575 --> 01:05:32,655
flash before your eyes...

655
01:05:32,935 --> 01:05:36,055
I experienced that but
the other way around. In fact...

656
01:05:36,335 --> 01:05:39,215
I was Arpaïx de Péreille,

657
01:05:39,695 --> 01:05:43,255
one of Raymond de Péreille's daughters.

658
01:05:43,535 --> 01:05:45,616
He was co-lord of Montségur.

659
01:05:46,056 --> 01:05:50,296
My role was very important.

660
01:05:51,536 --> 01:05:55,616
But I didn't end up
at the stake with the others.

661
01:05:56,056 --> 01:06:00,496
We ran off... in the direction
of the mountains.

662
01:06:01,136 --> 01:06:05,216
And we were arrested there by our own men.

663
01:06:06,056 --> 01:06:08,016
I don't know the reason why.

664
01:06:09,377 --> 01:06:11,697
It was very hard for me

665
01:06:11,977 --> 01:06:14,376
because I ran away with my husband

666
01:06:14,656 --> 01:06:16,816
and he had our child in his arms.

667
01:06:17,096 --> 01:06:19,377
It was a little boy but I don't know
exactly how old he was.

668
01:06:19,657 --> 01:06:22,257
And we were separated at that point.

669
01:06:23,217 --> 01:06:26,777
I spent the rest of my life
in a prison in Carcassonne.

670
01:06:28,097 --> 01:06:31,497
This is a place I need to
return to regularly

671
01:06:31,777 --> 01:06:34,337
to renew myself.

672
01:06:34,617 --> 01:06:36,537
I feel at home here.

673
01:06:38,178 --> 01:06:40,857
Not so long ago, about
three or fours years back,

674
01:06:43,057 --> 01:06:45,737
I realized that I'd lived
several past lives.

675
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:50,257
During an akashic lecture,
it was explained to me that

676
01:06:50,537 --> 01:06:55,138
I'd lived a very important one in the
Middle Ages and it had made a mark on me.

677
01:06:57,298 --> 01:06:59,978
Which explains the problems
of my present life.

678
01:07:00,498 --> 01:07:02,378
So I delved into this...

679
01:07:05,498 --> 01:07:07,898
...and I realized that

680
01:07:08,178 --> 01:07:10,778
everybody has had several lives
filled with different experiences

681
01:07:11,058 --> 01:07:13,018
<i>- good and bad -</i>

682
01:07:13,298 --> 01:07:15,579
and that one needs
to find a balance between the two

683
01:07:15,859 --> 01:07:18,339
in order to become
an accomplished soul

684
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:20,178
and no longer have the need
to reincarnate.

685
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:22,938
Maybe that's the reason I chose
medieval names for my children.

686
01:07:23,218 --> 01:07:25,378
I didn't yet know
about this past life,

687
01:07:25,658 --> 01:07:28,419
I didn't feel anything towards reincarnation.
I didn't even understand it.

688
01:07:28,699 --> 01:07:31,179
The names I'd chosen

689
01:07:31,459 --> 01:07:34,059
for my children were

690
01:07:34,779 --> 01:07:38,819
Aliénor, Margaux,
Childéric and Alaric

691
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:44,019
and I know now that it was no coincidence.
I've always been attracted to the Middle Ages.

692
01:07:44,499 --> 01:07:49,900
So evidently, there's a problem with those who mistake
their desires for reality or their dreams for reality.

693
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:52,419
Still, it's kind of amusing

694
01:07:52,699 --> 01:07:55,139
that during the course
of one year,

695
01:07:55,419 --> 01:07:57,820
four different Raymond de Péreilles
stop by the museum of Montségur

696
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,980
to introduce themselves...

697
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:01,820
If all the people pretending

698
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,020
to have been reincarnated
were accounted for,

699
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,540
I think the number of Cathars
burned at the stake

700
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:09,420
would greatly supersede 225. The number
would be closer to the thousands.

701
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,380
I think we're all destined
to find each other.

702
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:16,060
I've met people in Lavalanet

703
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:18,980
or in other places who've had
the same experience as me.

704
01:08:19,901 --> 01:08:22,740
<i>- Even on Facebook -</i>

705
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,460
So it's more or less of a coincidence...

706
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:31,021
JAAP'S VISION OF THE MAGDALENE

707
01:09:55,344 --> 01:09:58,823
I put this clock here
to be sure of what time it is...

708
01:10:00,623 --> 01:10:03,304
Because we're not in the real time.
If you check your watch,

709
01:10:04,624 --> 01:10:07,264
it's probably around 2 p.m.,
maybe a little more?

710
01:10:07,544 --> 01:10:08,664
A little later,

711
01:10:08,944 --> 01:10:10,504
2230 p.m.?

712
01:10:11,224 --> 01:10:13,904
And in fact, there's a two hour gap here

713
01:10:14,184 --> 01:10:16,864
so we live on fake time.

714
01:11:22,148 --> 01:11:23,733
So here's our famous pentagram.

715
01:21:22,568 --> 01:21:25,688
You just have to open
your heart and soul.

716
01:21:28,487 --> 01:21:31,367
The key is the heart.
That's where the grail is.

717
01:21:33,647 --> 01:21:36,326
Since our souls are locked
in this world of flesh

718
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:40,524
it is our destiny to rise and return
to the Father of all good souls.

719
01:21:43,884 --> 01:21:48,683
That's it. Have a nice journey home...

720
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,000
