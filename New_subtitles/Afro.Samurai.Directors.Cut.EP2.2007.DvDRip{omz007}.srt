       AFRO SAMURAI
           Episode : 2

3
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,580
You can't get away, kid.

4
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:49,290
Don't make it hard on yourself.

5
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:53,290
Be a good boy and hand that Number
Two headband over nice and slow-like...

6
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,810
Stop right there, Kiddo.
You draw that sword and you're dead.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,920
What the hell is with you kid?

8
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,070
You gotta learn to respect your elders.

9
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,480
Lookee here,
now I'm the Number Two warrior.

10
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:20,970
I'm coming for you, Number One.

11
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:22,470
What the hell is this?

12
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:24,410
This kid is really some kind of freak.

13
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,570
He's carrying a rotten head around 
in his backpack.

14
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,920
Ew ! Wait a minute!

15
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:29,030
I know that guy!

16
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:30,650
Yeah, that's the old Number One.

17
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,940
Yeah you're right.

18
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:33,540
Here, give it to me.

19
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,250
You want this back kiddo?

20
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,140
Then catch!

21
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,240
Kids these days...

22
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,830
Yeah, they got no respect.
- Yeah, no respect at all.

23
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,910
Hey, wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

24
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,680
Oh sleepyhead! Hey Jinno, you 
should come look at this!

25
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:55,580
Wow, check this out!

26
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:57,200
Some piece of work.

27
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,670
He won't wake up, Jinno!

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,510
What? Whoa!

29
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,780
Master! Master!

30
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,190
The bandits must have got him.

31
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:13,280
This is bad! Two guys yesterday, 
and now a kid.

32
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,290
He is not a morning person.

33
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,680
My God! He's alive!

34
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,920
Master! Master! He's alive!

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,230
Mr. Sleepy.

36
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,690
Don't get up yet.

37
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,930
You've been badly wounded and 
poisoned.

38
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,250
It will take some time for you to 
recover.

39
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,190
We discovered you bleeding on 
the river bank.

40
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,950
I am called Okiku.

41
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:00,370
You must rest, mighty samurai.

42
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,000
I will take care of you.

43
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,330
Don't be alarmed.
Of course we know you're a samurai.

44
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,580
For who else but a samurai could 
clutch his sword in a raging river...

45
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:27,840
While poisoned, unconscious, 
and with a broken hand.

46
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,560
Sleep... When you awake,
I'll have a meal prepared.

47
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,510
Damn, you're one lucky dawg, Afro!

48
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,230
You look like a mummy.
- Cut it out, Otsuru.

49
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,470
Do not worry, young Afro.

50
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,570
In my dojo, we are all wounded orphans.

51
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,450
You are among friends.

52
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:56,030
Treat him well, my students.

53
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:57,030
Yes Master!

54
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,030
Go! Go! Go!

55
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,030
Strike the ground with yourself.

56
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,030
How can you wield a sword if you can't
dig a hole?

57
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,030
You're mad at the dirt Jinno?

58
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,030
Your body is all stiff. Think less. Relax.

59
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,030
I'll stay calm and constantly flowing.
Like a river.

60
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,030
Cheer up, Afro.

61
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,400
Oh! I see we up!

62
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:41,290
Think I wasn't gonna find you?

63
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,710
I just took a little R and R but 
look at you, boy!

64
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:53,260
Oh bright eyed and bushy tailed,
fish, flowers, sunshine...

65
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,350
I see somebody getting their little resort on.
HA HA!!!

66
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,490
Hoo, I bet ya that babe will...
wa-wa-what's her name? Okiku!

67
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,980
Bet she tastes a hell of a lot better 
than trout!

68
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:08,240
Don't think I didn't notice her 
checking you out?

69
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,220
Huh? Huh? Don't tell me...

70
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,290
You ain't noticed?

71
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,940
This place is bananas! Sh*t.

72
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,260
I'm thinking, sh*t, I'm even gonna 
find me a little hottie to go kick it with...

73
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:28,430
Beats and cold, cool massage... 
Get all sweaty...

74
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,170
If ya know what I mean.

75
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:33,170
She got a friend, maybe we can do an orgy.
Y'know, huh!? Huh!?

76
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,170
Awrightawrightawrightawrightawright, alright.

77
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:39,170
So you ain't the swinging type! Alright!

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,170
I still can get my sex on!

79
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:45,170
You know gettin' your jimmie waxed 
might help you recuperate.

80
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,040
All right, all right, you relax.

81
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:51,150
You wanna do your night solo on 
the low-low?

82
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:54,860
Cool! Don't forget, my cellie's off!

83
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:16,860
You must not fight over food.

84
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:20,860
Come on, Afro.

85
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,860
We're all waiting on you dude.

86
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:25,860
We got fishing duties, down at 
the river.

87
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:28,860
Don't you remember? Come on.
We're gonna be late.

88
00:07:29,191 --> 00:07:32,860
You know how everyone gets 
when there's not enough fish 
to eat around here.

89
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:36,860
Look, I don't mean to push. But, 
you really oughta wolf it down.

90
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:38,860
You'll need all your strength.

91
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:40,860
Tricking fish ain't easy.

92
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:42,860
Tricking fish ain't easy. 
Wolf 'em down!

93
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,860
Come on!

94
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,430
Let's get to it!

95
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,880
Look, they're escaping!

96
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,200
Let's grab 'em!
- Yeah!

97
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,710
Yeah! grab 'em !

98
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,850
You're ready for this, Otsuru?

99
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,970
Yeah, a fish!

100
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:22,110
Nice and fat... just like the doctor ordered.

101
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,560
It's what the master calls the single beat.

102
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:27,210
Well, cook it up!

103
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:29,600
Then we can have a quadruple treat!

104
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,810
But there are six of us.
Isn't that a sextuplet treat?

105
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,570
Huh?

106
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,240
uh... I mean...

107
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,710
Oh, I must have disturbed you in 
the middle of a dream.

108
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,140
Was it pleasant?

109
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,080
Forgive me, I'm being nosy.

110
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,640
It's time for you medicine.

111
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,600
Your wounds heal well, master samurai.

112
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,300
So tonight, I will cook my special 
fish for you.

113
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,920
You do like fish, don't you?

114
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,000
Fresh vegetables! Fresh vegetables!

115
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,030
Not interested kid. Beat it.

116
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,320
No luck today. Let's go home, Afro.

117
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,890
So, 'bout Number Two... Is it true?

118
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,270
That's what they say.

119
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:59,450
Apparently, he's back in town.

120
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:01,310
Maybe I'll give it a shot.

121
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:05,440
Whatever. Like you got what it 
takes to be the Number Two warrior 
of the world.

122
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,810
What the f*ck?
What's this kid doing here?

123
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,650
Where is the Number Two?

124
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,130
Who?

125
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,880
The Number Two headband, tell 
me who has it.

126
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,600
Er, I don't know what you're talking about.

127
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,440
Tell me where he is.

128
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,440
You little c*ck sucker!

129
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,020
You think you're a killer, boy? Huh?

130
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,280
I'll show you a killer.

131
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,270
When you fight to kill, finish the job.

132
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,210
Target is confirmed.

133
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:56,130
Yes, he's still injured. An easy prey 
for my skills.

134
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,260
Yes, I understand your point...

135
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:04,020
But! My master brother, I would 
give my life to work in your inner circle.

136
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,630
Can you do it?

137
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:09,740
Yes, please let me slay the Afro Samurai.

138
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,540
Your supper is ready.

139
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,380
What's the matter?

140
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,300
Thanks for everything.

141
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,830
You're leaving?

142
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,830
Tomorrow.

143
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,260
Please, keep it for your travels.

144
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,000
Thank you.

145
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,840
Will you not stay with me?

146
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,440
For just, one more day?

147
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,330
There'll be a summer festival
tomorrow night at the village below.

148
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,630
If it's not too much to ask.

149
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:17,370
Will you stay and watch the 
fireworks with me?

150
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,400
Foolish boy!

151
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:26,720
Never speak to me of such things 
again!

152
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:29,900
Games of power or revenge, they 
lead to nothing!

153
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,610
Do you really know what it
means to be the Number Two?

154
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:36,170
It is a life of murder.

155
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,330
We are born men in order to live, 
not to kill.

156
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,070
You must break the chain.

157
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:46,010
Only then can we be free of this 
terrible cycle.

158
00:13:55,111 --> 00:13:56,010
What is this?

159
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:58,010
Swampwater.

160
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:00,010
Just try it.

161
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,010
Will it put hair on my chest?

162
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,010
Eww. eww! Taste like crap!

163
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,010
Here Afro, you try it.

164
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,010
ewwww...

165
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,010
This boy's the only one with real taste.

166
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,010
Can I have some more?

167
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,010
Is he for real! 
Afro, you don't have to be polite.

168
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:35,010
It's like I always say, if heaven could 
be bottled, it just might taste like my 
lemonade.

169
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,010
Le.. na.. mode?

170
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,010
Lemonade...

171
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,010
Lemonade.

172
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,010
Jinno - Lemonade.

173
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,010
Otsuru - Lemonade

174
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,320
Hey kid! We know it was
you that killed our brother.

175
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,690
Too bad you have to pay for it!

176
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,530
You little son of a b*tch.

177
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,280
What the... huh?

178
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,160
Hey, that's my knife!

179
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,760
How did you...

180
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,370
You little...

181
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,340
You ain't gonna get away from me!

182
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,600
This can't be...

183
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,760
I got him!

184
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:44,570
Good. Don't let him get away.

185
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,980
Now let's see you spit swamp water, 
brat.

186
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,590
You are dead now.

187
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:53,950
Hey shorty!

188
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,600
What was that?

189
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,040
What did you just call me?

190
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,900
Sh*t!

191
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:05,140
Afro!

192
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,040
Yeah !
- Leave him alone!

193
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,840
Behind you!

194
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,570
Afro!

195
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,680
F*ckin' brats! What the...

196
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:18,550
Sh*t, it's stuck! Damn it!

197
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,520
I'll kill you!

198
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,270
Holy smoke!

199
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,990
Killing some little kid is
normally against my principles.

200
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:39,340
But when you cut my pal's brother, 
you enter the world of killing, boy.

201
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:41,230
Before I kill you, remember this.

202
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:45,160
If you're gonna swing a sword, 
you better be ready to get cut by 
one too.

203
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:46,790
Say your prayers...

204
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,510
Damn it!

205
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,460
You missed!

206
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,350
You piece of sh*t!

207
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,960
Freaking kid... I should have...

208
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,460
Do you know where Number Two is?

209
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:12,570
What was that?

210
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:14,400
I want to see Number Two.

211
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:15,940
What for?

212
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:18,150
To kill him! I'll kill him!

213
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,110
Stop laughing and tell me!

214
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,490
He's already dead.

215
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:23,590
What?

216
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:25,620
There's a new Number Two.

217
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:27,620
You'll never find him.

218
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,100
He's probably long gone.

219
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,250
Yes. Yes.
No, I need more time.

220
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,720
I haven't acquired that data yet.

221
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,620
What I do have has been
downloaded onto my cellphone.

222
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,660
Yes. Yes. Understood.

223
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,560
Sorry.

224
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,770
Okiku.

225
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,480
Are you there?

226
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,900
Yes.

227
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,310
What is the matter, disciple Okiku?

228
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,600
Nothing.
Everything will be taken care of.

229
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,240
Yes, hello, Brother 2 here.

230
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,240
Yo yo yo yo yo, Afro.

231
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:57,840
Can I ask you something?

232
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,670
I know you cast away your feelings 
and all...

233
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:04,010
But does that mean casting
away your manhood too?

234
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,010
Hoo my massage don't get
much better than no girl...

235
00:19:09,051 --> 00:19:14,180
She's sweet, pretty, knows a first 
aid, can brawl a mean fish dinner!

236
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,610
I call that practically marriage material.

237
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,690
Come on now, confess.

238
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:21,900
You wanna hit that booty.

239
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,030
I just wanna see my boy happy, you know.

240
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,810
Seriously man! Now don't you think there's
something vaguely familiar about that woman?

241
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,000
Look. If you ain't gonna
knock them boots, I will.

242
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,000
Go on then.

243
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,530
Care for some?

244
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,550
It's lemonade. Do you like it?

245
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,310
I do.

246
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,540
I'm glad.

247
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,130
Oh, they're beautiful.

248
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,860
This is my favorite time of the
year, fireworks and the festivities.

249
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,940
The people coming and going.

250
00:20:11,981 --> 00:20:14,460
Everyone just simply having a good time.

251
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,540
May I ask where you're traveling to, 
mighty samurai?

252
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,580
East.

253
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,300
East.

254
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,140
Oh, don't you love the sky, they're 
my favorite.

255
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,140
It's all because of you!

256
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,570
Forgive me ! I've become
a ninja of the Empty Seven clan!

257
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:30,670
I've been siphoning your
memories to copy your sword skills.

258
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,040
But I can't.
I can't do it anymore.

259
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,360
Tell me you're still that same boy
from those wonderful times so long ago.

260
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,360
Get out of my way.

261
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,360
Otsuru.

262
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,200
Run Afro!

263
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,480
Otsuru!

264
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,300
You f*ckin' whore! This is the price 
you pay for your betrayal.

265
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,460
The data...

266
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,170
We have obtained the data!

267
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,970
That's enough, Brother 6!

268
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:33,890
We are leaving!

269
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,930
Damn shame, ain't it?

270
00:23:56,971 --> 00:24:01,220
Just when you start getting your 
groove on, sh*t always gotta get 
killed, burnt down, or whatever!

271
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,360
Hey, ya know your afro got a little 
scorched there, homie?

272
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,570
You listening to me?

273
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,350
Ha! Man, you really are a cold-blooded 
motherf*cker!

274
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:21,070
Hey, how about we keep this little a...
momento of your lady friend, huh?

275
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,070
TO BE CONTINUED...
