1
00:00:23,355 --> 00:00:24,990
John Robinson: FINALLY...

2
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:28,361
THE WARRING NATIONS OF EARTH HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR DIFFERENCES

3
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,731
AND BANDED TOGETHER TO SAVE OUR PLANET.

4
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:34,967
THE UNITED GLOBAL SPACE FORCE

5
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,636
WAS SEARCHING THE GALAXY

6
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,838
FOR WORLDS RICH WITH DRINKABLE WATER

7
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:40,439
AND BREATHABLE AIR.

8
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:43,976
THE HYPERGATE WAS OUR BEST HOPE TO COLONIZE SPACE,

9
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:45,978
OUR BEST HOPE FOR SURVIVAL.

10
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,380
BUT AS WE PREPARED

11
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:49,982
TO LAUNCH OURSELVES INTO THE BLACK OF SPACE,

12
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,250
TERRORIST FORCES,

13
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,287
CALLING THEMSELVES "THE GLOBAL SEDITION"

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,156
WERE PREPARING TO STRIKE.

15
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,396
Pilot: GRISSOM BASE, THIS IS CARGO 7

16
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:04,897
REQUESTING LANDING CLEARANCE.

17
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,031
Control: ROGER, TRANSPORT.

18
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:07,167
THIS IS GRISSOM GATE CONTROL.

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,735
PLEASE DOWNLOAD SECURITY CODES.

20
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:10,370
Pilot: DOWNLOADING.

21
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,538
TRANSPORT, I'VE GOT 2 BLIPS INSIDE YOUR RADAR SIGNATURE.

22
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,140
SAL, THEY'RE HIDING IN YOUR SHADOW.

23
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:15,642
Pilot: I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

24
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,650
THIS IS GATE CONTROL. BATTLE STATIONS.

25
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,254
Control: BATTLE STATIONS.

26
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,857
2 SEDITION FIGHTERS ARE ATTACKING THE HYPERGATE.

27
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,258
BATTLE STATIONS.

28
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:33,592
Don West: GATE CONTROL, THIS IS EAGLE 1.

29
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,327
I'M LOCKED AND LOADED, READY TO FLY.

30
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:36,862
Control: ROGER, EAGLE 1.

31
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,566
YOU'RE CLEAR TO LAUNCH.

32
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,405
JEB, WHERE ARE YOU, BUDDY?

33
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:49,308
THIS COLD WAR JUST GOT HOT.

34
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,877
THEY'RE SEDITION RAIDERS.

35
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,347
IT'S ANOTHER MUTANT SUICIDE SQUAD.

36
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,950
HERE WE GO. MAN TO MAN. SPLIT THEM UP.

37
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,951
OK, LAST ONE TO KILL A BAD GUY

38
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,221
BUYS THE BEER.

39
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,357
Don: I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THE GATE,

40
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:06,759
TRY AND GET OUT IN FRONT OF HIM.

41
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,262
Jeb: THAT'S NOT STANDARD PROCEDURE, DON.

42
00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:14,300
I'M GETTIN' SOME HEAT.

43
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,745
DAMN, YOU GEN-TECHS ARE UGLY UP CLOSE.

44
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:26,779
Computer: TARGET LOCK.

45
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:27,914
SHOW TIME.

46
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:35,722
YEE-HAW!

47
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,990
BOGEY 1 DISPATCHED.

48
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,728
Jeb: DON, HE'S RIGHT ON MY TAIL.

49
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,329
DAMN! CAN'T SHAKE HIM.

50
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,002
I'VE BEEN HIT!

51
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:51,404
WEAPONS ARE OFF-LINE.

52
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,873
I'M GONNA JETTISON THE MAIN DRIVE CORE.

53
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:56,442
HERE YOU ARE.

54
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,283
AM I GOOD OR WHAT?

55
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,617
Computer: WARNING.

56
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:07,152
FAILURE IN REDUNDANT DRIVE SYSTEMS.

57
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:09,422
DAMN. GATE CONTROL, THIS IS RANGER 1.

58
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:12,191
ENGINES WILL NOT RESPOND.

59
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:15,194
DON, I'M FALLING TOWARDS THE HYPERGATE, MAN.

60
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,697
BREAKING THRUSTERS WON'T FIRE!

61
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,000
Computer: IMPACT IN 30 SECONDS.

62
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:22,435
RANGER 1, THIS IS BASE.

63
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,771
RESCUE CRAFT HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED.

64
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,640
GRISSOM, THIS IS EAGLE 1.

65
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,009
THOSE PODS WILL NEVER REACH HIM IN TIME.

66
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:31,610
I'M GOING IN.

67
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,045
MAJOR WEST, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO JEOPARDIZE--

68
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,213
[CLICK]

69
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:35,581
NEVER LIKED THAT STATION ANYWAY.

70
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,917
Computer: WARNING. PROXIMITY ALERT.

71
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:41,521
AAH!

72
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:44,157
HANG ON, JEB. I'M COMING IN.

73
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,427
ABORT. ABORT!

74
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,061
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A LITTLE KISS.

75
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:51,230
NOW, DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY.

76
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:52,932
Computer: IMPACT IN 5 SECONDS.

77
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,350
HEY, DON...

78
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,353
DOES THIS MEAN WE'RE GOING STEADY?

79
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,588
YOU'RE NOT GETTING OUT OF BUYING THOSE BEERS

80
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:16,956
THAT EASY.

81
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,503
Announcer: WITH INTREPID PIONEERING SPIRIT,

82
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:33,505
THE ROBINSON FAMILY WILL JOURNEY

83
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,507
TO THE DISTANT WORLD OF ALPHA PRIME.

84
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:38,844
WHAT KIND OF FUTURE CAN OUR CHILDREN LOOK FORWARD TO?

85
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:40,846
A FUTURE IN PARADISE.

86
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,247
THE JUPITER MISSION--

87
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,217
MADE POSSIBLE BY THE U.S. ARMY

88
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,984
AND SILICON GRAPHICS CORPORATION.

89
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:47,253
S.G.I...

90
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:50,289
...SAVING THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN.

91
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:51,958
GIVE ME A BREAK.

92
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,526
Computer: HOLO-CALL FROM HOUSTON MIDDLE SCHOOL.

93
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,628
Maureen Robinson: HELLO?

94
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:57,663
HELLO, PRINCIPAL CARTWRIGHT.

95
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:59,531
WHAT EXACTLY HAS HE DONE THIS TIME?

96
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:02,134
HE HACKED OUR MAIN POWER GRID

97
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,369
TO RUN HIS EXPERIMENT.

98
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:06,505
THE SCHOOL WAS IN CHAOS.

99
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,607
Will: YEAH, RIGHT.

100
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,910
WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE LIGHTS.

101
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:18,183
THIS IS NO LAUGHING MATTER, PROFESSOR ROBINSON.

102
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:21,654
WILL IS-- IS TERRIBLY GIFTED.

103
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:24,290
THE CHANGING SHAPE OF EDUCATION.

104
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:27,492
HIS LITTLE TIME MACHINES, THOUGH PURE FANCY,

105
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:30,830
ARE THE PRODUCTS OF A TRULY BRILLIANT MIND.

106
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,200
NO MORE MONKEY BUSINESS.

107
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,701
I MEAN IT.

108
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:38,537
THE BOY IS STARVED FOR ATTENTION.

109
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,041
I KNOW YOUR LIFE IS ANYTHING BUT NORMAL RIGHT NOW,

110
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:43,710
BUT WASN'T THERE SOME WAY

111
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,279
HIS FATHER COULD HAVE ATTENDED THE SCIENCE FAIR?

112
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,081
AS YOU ARE AWARE,

113
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:52,285
ALPHA PRIME IS THE ONLY OTHER HABITABLE PLANET

114
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:56,122
YET DETECTED BY DEEP SPACE RECON.

115
00:05:56,255 --> 00:06:01,060
MY CREW WILL SLEEP AWAY OUR 10-YEAR JOURNEY THERE

116
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,795
IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION.

117
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:04,864
ONCE WE HAVE RENDEZVOUSED

118
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,733
WITH THE RESEARCH COLONY ON ALPHA,

119
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,535
I WILL SUPERVISE CONSTRUCTION OF A HYPERGATE.

120
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:12,137
BY THEN, TECHNICIANS HERE ON EARTH

121
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,341
WILL HAVE COMPLETED THE COMPANION HYPERGATE

122
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:18,611
IN OUR PLANET'S ORBIT.

123
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,615
ONCE BOTH GATES ARE COMPLETE,

124
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:27,152
SHIPS WILL BE ABLE TO PASS INSTANTANEOUSLY BETWEEN THEM.

125
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:31,023
IMMEDIATE COLONIZATION OF ALPHA PRIME WILL BE POSSIBLE.

126
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:34,360
CAN'T YOU USE THE JUPITER'S HYPER-ENGINE

127
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,328
TO ZAP STRAIGHT TO ALPHA PRIME?

128
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,765
HYPERSPACE EXISTS BENEATH NORMAL SPACE.

129
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,769
IF YOU TRY TO ENTER HYPERSPACE WITHOUT A GATE,

130
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,904
YOUR EXIT FACTOR IS RANDOM.

131
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,374
THERE'S NO TELLING WHERE YOU'D COME OUT.

132
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:51,644
98% OF THE GALAXY IS STILL UNCHARTED.

133
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:54,646
THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE OUT THERE TO GET LOST IN.

134
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,648
PROFESSOR. PROFESSOR.

135
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:59,051
HOW IS CAPTAIN DANIELS RECOVERING FROM THE FLU?

136
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:01,253
WILL HE STILL BE ABLE TO PILOT THE MISSION?

137
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,188
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

138
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:07,193
YOU CAME TO GET YOUR FIRST LOOK AT THE JUPITER 1.

139
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:10,395
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH?

140
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:12,298
LET'S MOVE INTO THE LAUNCH DOME.

141
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,799
ONE MORE QUESTION, PROFESSOR.

142
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:16,469
NOW THAT THE MISSION'S BEEN PUSHED UP,

143
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,904
HOW DO YOUR CHILDREN FEEL

144
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,438
ABOUT LEAVING THE EARTH BEHIND?

145
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,475
THEY COULDN'T BE MORE EXCITED.

146
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,643
THIS MISSION SUCKS!

147
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,412
I DON'T WANNA LEAVE EARLY.

148
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:27,546
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANNA GO AT ALL.

149
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,815
WE WILL DISCUSS THIS AT DINNER.

150
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:32,818
FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS, I'VE MISSED EVERYTHING TRAINING

151
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,287
SO I CAN SPEND THE NEXT 10 YEARS

152
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,422
MISSING EVERYTHING ELSE.

153
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,425
I'M NOT STAYING HOME FOR DINNER.

154
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:41,427
I'M GOING OUT TO SEE MY FRIENDS.

155
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,029
Maureen: PENNY.

156
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,563
I'M GOING OUT TO...

157
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,199
SAY GOOD-BYE TO MY ENTIRE LIFE.

158
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,869
PENNY, I NEED YOU HERE TONIGHT.

159
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,003
W-WAIT A MINUTE.

160
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,512
ON THIS EVE,

161
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,047
BEFORE SHE'S TORN FROM EVERYTHING SHE KNOWS--

162
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,050
KIDNAPPED...

163
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,184
HURLED INTO DEEP SPACE

164
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:07,820
AGAINST HER WILL--

165
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:10,456
WHAT THOUGHTS FILL THE MIND OF THE DARING SPACE CAPTIVE?

166
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,290
WILL THERE BE BOYS ON ALPHA PRIME?

167
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:14,260
WHAT WILL I WEAR?

168
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,864
I WONDER WHAT IT'LL BE LIKE

169
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,100
TO JETTISON YOUR BODY INTO DEEP SPACE.

170
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:23,569
FIRST...

171
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,871
YOU'LL TRY HOLDING YOUR BREATH...

172
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:29,375
BUT YOUR BLOOD'S ALREADY BEGUN TO BOIL.

173
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,610
AND THEN YOUR SKIN...

174
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,246
INFLATES LIKE A BALLOON.

175
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,481
AND THEN...

176
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:36,882
POP.

177
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,985
DO THEY HAVE A NAME FOR WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

178
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,089
DAD SAYS DON'T BRING THEM,

179
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,625
LIKE ANYTHING I DO MATTERS TO HIM.

180
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:48,860
DON'T SWEAT IT, KID.

181
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:51,496
I GOT APOLOGY VIDEOS FOR 2 BIRTHDAYS.

182
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,864
[BREAKS VACUUM SEAL]

183
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:55,301
AND HE FORGOT LAST YEAR COMPLETELY.

184
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:59,539
THIS MISSION'S THE ONLY THING HE CARES ABOUT ANYMORE.

185
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,513
SO THAT'S A "NO" TO FAMILY DINNER?

186
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:09,515
LET'S SEE.

187
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,316
DO I SPEND MY LAST NIGHT ON EARTH

188
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,320
WATCHING MOM AND DAD PRETEND NOT TO BE FIGHTING AGAIN

189
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:18,224
OR BLOW 10-YEARS-WORTH OF ALLOWANCE AT THE MALL?

190
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:21,159
YOU DO THE MATH.

191
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:22,728
MOM'S GONNA GO THERMAL.

192
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,530
WHAT'S SHE GONNA DO, GROUND ME?

193
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:29,568
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT JAMMING IN A NEW PILOT THE LAST SECOND.

194
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,536
THE GLOBAL SEDITION IS GETTING BRAVE.

195
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,772
FIRST THE HYPERGATE, THEN DANIELS.

196
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,974
NEXT TIME THEY MAY ATTACK THE LAUNCH DOME.

197
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:36,775
DAMN.

198
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,277
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT.

199
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,545
WILL'S SCIENCE FAIR.

200
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:41,546
REMINDER. APOLOGY VIDEO FOR WILL.

201
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,915
HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

202
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,349
BEN, LISTEN.

203
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:47,152
MY FAMILY IS ON THIS MISSION.

204
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:50,155
I NEED A PILOT WHO'S MORE THAN JUST SPIT AND POLISH.

205
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,590
I'VE GOT YOUR MAN.

206
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:53,926
HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT YET.

207
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:00,499
AT EASE, MAJOR.

208
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,101
SIR, WHY WAS I PULLED FROM ACTIVE DUTY?

209
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,169
THOSE GEN-TECHS MAY ATTACK AGAIN. I--

210
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:05,838
I NEED TO BE UP THERE.

211
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:07,606
DO YOU KNOW PROFESSOR ROBINSON?

212
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:09,342
BY REPUTATION ONLY.

213
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,143
YOUR FATHER'S BATTLE STRATEGIES

214
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,178
WERE REQUIRED READING AT THE ACADEMY.

215
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,916
Ben: WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE JUPITER MISSION?

216
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,985
THE JUPITER IS AN OVERSIZED ROBOT.

217
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,321
EVERYTHING'S AUTOMATIC.

218
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,257
ANY MONKEY IN A FLIGHT SUIT

219
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,592
CAN PILOT THAT SHIP OUT OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM

220
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:29,728
AND SET HER DOWN ON ALPHA PRIME.

221
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,731
IT'S A BABY-SITTING JOB, SIR.

222
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:33,999
NO OFFENSE.

223
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,601
Ben: MAJOR, ARE YOU AWARE

224
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,237
EARTH'S RESOURCES ARE SEVERELY LIMITED?

225
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,972
EVERY SCHOOLCHILD KNOWS

226
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:43,075
THAT OUR RECYCLING TECHNOLOGIES WILL CURE THE ENVIRONMENT.

227
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:45,778
SENDING A FAMILY ACROSS THE GALAXY

228
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,780
IS A PUBLICITY STUNT TO SELL COMPUTERS

229
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,181
TO PEOPLE OF ALL AGES.

230
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,882
EVERY SCHOOLCHILD HAS BEEN LIED TO.

231
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:53,752
RECYCLING TECHNOLOGIES CAME TOO LATE.

232
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,789
ALL FOSSIL FUELS ARE VIRTUALLY EXHAUSTED.

233
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,525
THE OZONE LAYER IS DOWN TO 40%.

234
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:02,027
IN 2 DECADES,

235
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,664
THE EARTH WILL BE UNABLE TO SUPPORT HUMAN LIFE.

236
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,065
THE NEW GLOBAL SEDITION

237
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:08,901
KNOWS THE TRUTH AS WELL AS WE DO.

238
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,903
THEY'RE BUILDING THEIR OWN HYPERGATE.

239
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,906
THEY HOPE TO COLONIZE ALPHA PRIME FIRST.

240
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,807
IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL,

241
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,377
WESTERN DEMONS LIKE YOU AND I, MAJOR WEST,

242
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,312
WILL BE LEFT ON EARTH TO DIE.

243
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:22,848
CAPTAIN DANIELS DOESN'T HAVE THE FLU, DOES HE, SIR?

244
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:26,217
CAPTAIN DANIELS WAS MURDERED IN HIS APARTMENT LAST NIGHT.

245
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:28,653
THE FLU STORY IS A COVER WE FED THE PRESS.

246
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:30,856
I FLEW WITH MIKE.

247
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:33,192
WE SHOULD PULSE-BLAST THEIR BASES!

248
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,593
A DECISIVE STRIKE NOW!

249
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:35,995
MY SQUADRON IS ALERT STATUS AND--

250
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,564
YOUR RESCUE STUNT WAS FOOLHARDY!

251
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,199
I HAD A FRIEND IN TROUBLE.

252
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,801
SO YOU ENDANGERED A $10-BILLION SPACECRAFT,

253
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:45,170
DISOBEYED A DIRECT ORDER BECAUSE OF A FRIEND?

254
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:46,571
YES, SIR.

255
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,307

256
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,810

257
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:54,313
HE'LL DO.

258
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,352
CONGRATULATIONS, MAJOR.

259
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,055
YOU'RE THE NEW PILOT OF THE JUPITER MISSION.

260
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:08,193

THE SEDITION HIRED ME TO PROVIDE ACCESS

264
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:18,570
TO DANIELS' APARTMENT AND NO MORE.

265
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:21,106
MY WORK IS DONE.

266
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,809
THEY'VE FOUND A REPLACEMENT PILOT.

267
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:25,877
OUR ATTACK ON THE HYPERGATE FAILED.

268
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,380
HOW TRAGIC...FOR YOU.

269
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:33,452
WE REQUIRE A MORE DIRECT INTERVENTION ON YOUR PART.

270
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,487
OH, I SEE.

271
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,489
WELL...

272
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,825
IT WILL COST YOU.

273
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,495
AND I'M AFRAID THAT MY PRICE

274
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,897
HAS JUST BECOME...

275
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,498

00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,532

286
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:21,533

288
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,542
THE MISSION PROTOCOLS ARE SIMPLE.

289
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,942
PROFESSOR ROBINSON IS IN COMMAND

290
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,945
UNLESS YOU ENCOUNTER A MILITARY EMERGENCY.

291
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,080

ON THIS BEAUTY.

00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,587
IF YOU HAVE TO BE A BABY-SITTER,

303
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,588
IT'S NOT SUCH A BAD NURSERY.

304
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,524
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE, MAJOR?

305
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:21,326

306

I CAN'T GET THE CRYO-SLEEP SYSTEMS

MY ONLY CONDITION FOR ACCEPTING THIS MISSION

348
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,060
WAS THAT WE COULD BRING THE CHILDREN WITH US

349
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,328
SO DOING OUR JOB WOULDN'T MEAN LEAVING THEM BEHIND,

350
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:40,031
SO FUTURE GENERATIONS WOULD HAVE A NEW HOME.

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,338
JUST TO GET HIS FATHER'S ATTENTION,

00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:49,541

00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:53,612

358
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,714

ATTEMPTING CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS.

544
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:50,288
I WANT TO GO HOME NOW.

545
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,324
Don: NAVIGATION'S DOWN, SYSTEM SHORTS EVERYWHERE.

546
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:56,060
DAMN. COMMUNICATIONS ARE OUT.

547
00:29:56,193 --> 00:29:58,162
LINK UP THE SECONDARY SYSTEM.

548
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,097
SHUNTING POWER FROM RESERVE.

549
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:00,898
COME ON.

550
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,634
John: TRY IT NOW.

551
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,769
Don: OK. NAVIGATIONAL BOARDS ARE LIT.

552
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,704
John: CAN WE REROUTE?

553
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:08,773
Don: I'M STILL LOCKED OUT OF THE HELM.

554
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:10,708
John: NOTHING IN COMPUTER CONTROL.

555
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:12,110
MAIN COM TO MANUAL.

556
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,478
SEE IF SHE'LL RESPOND.

557
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:15,747
Don: THE MAIN SUBROUTINE STILL WON'T OPEN.

558
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,049
I'M GONNA TRY REMOTE OPS.

559
00:30:20,317 --> 00:30:21,519
AAH!

560
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:23,955
GET BACK! GET AWAY FROM ME!

561
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,925
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?

562
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,761
MAJOR WEST, THANK GOD IT'S YOU.

563
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,997
I WAS IN HERE TO DO SOME LAST MINUTE CHECKS,

564
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,165
AND SOMEBODY HIT ME FROM BEHIND.

565
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:36,667
THAT'S SEDITION TECHNOLOGY.

566
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,536
YOU'RE A DAMN SPY.

567
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:39,637
YOU DID THIS.

568
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,638
NO!

569
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:42,006
AAH!

570
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:43,607
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

571
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:44,909
THROWING OUT THE TRASH!

572
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,944
Maureen: WE NEED HELP!

573
00:30:47,077 --> 00:30:50,014
I CAN'T GET JUDY OUT! SHE'S DYING!

574
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:56,086
TOUCH ME, AND THE GIRL DIES!

575
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,155
I DON'T DEAL WITH DEAD MEN.

576
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,891
KILL ME, KILL THE GIRL.

577
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,361
HOW MUCH IS YOUR REVENGE WORTH, MAJOR?

578
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:04,596
I CAN SAVE HER LIFE,

579
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,698
BUT ONLY IF YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD AS AN OFFICER

580
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:09,300
THAT YOU WILL SPARE MINE.

581
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,670
HELP HER.

582
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:15,306
I'VE GOT HELM CONTROL.

583
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,547
UH-OH.

584
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,151
WE'RE WAY OFF COURSE.

585
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,856
WE'RE CAUGHT IN THE SUN'S GRAVITATIONAL PULL.

586
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,324
IS THAT WHAT THAT BIG ROUND BALL IS?

587
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:36,461
[CLANG]

588
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:41,566
WE'VE GOT 4 MINUTES BEFORE THE OUTER HULL BEGINS TO MELT.

589
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,802
I NEED YOU TO CHECK ON THE THRUSTER ALIGNMENTS.

590
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:46,737
PROFESSOR!

591
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,472
I'M GONNA TRY FOR THE MERCURY MINES.

592
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:52,109
I'LL NEED DR. ROBINSON'S PORTABLE GURNEY.

593
00:31:52,242 --> 00:31:53,677
YOU'LL FIND IT BELOW.

594
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,080
Maureen: SMITH, COME ON!

595
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:00,918
YOU TRIED TO KILL MY FAMILY.

596
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:02,419
WE TRUSTED YOU.

597
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,855
IT'S THE WORLD BEHIND THE WORLD, PROFESSOR ROBINSON.

598
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:06,023
LIE ONCE, CHEAT TWICE,

599
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,326
AND EVERYTHING BECOMES CLEAR.

600
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:13,063
DO NOT MISTAKE MY DECEPTION FOR A CHARACTER FLAW.

601
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,465
IT IS A PHILOSOPHICAL CHOICE

602
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:17,635
THAT I'VE FOUND IN A STUDY OF THE UNIVERSE.

603
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:18,969
IT IS A WAY OF LIFE.

604
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,438
YOU'RE A MONSTER.

605
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:23,107
PERHAPS, BUT I'M ALSO THE ONLY ONE

606
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,109
THAT CAN SAVE YOUR DAUGHTER'S LIFE.

607
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:27,511
PENNY, PRECIOUS,

608
00:32:27,644 --> 00:32:29,714
I WANT YOU TO SHORT THE POWER ON MY COMMAND.

609
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:33,084
DOES HE HAVE TO CALL ME PRECIOUS?

610
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,520
PENNY, PRECIOUS.

611
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,423
NOW!

612
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:45,429
Maureen: SHE'S NOT BREATHING.

613
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:47,365
SICK BAY, MOVE!

614
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:48,833
Don: THE SUN WON'T LET US GO.

615
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,834
HEAT SHIELD BREACH IN 60 SECONDS.

616
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,203
I NEED OPTIONS, PROFESSOR.

617
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:54,772
WE HAVE TO DIVERT ALL POWER TO THE ENGINES.

618
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:56,808
I'M REROUTING LIFE SCIENCES.

619
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,976
Computer: REROUTING LIFE SUPPORT.

620
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,846
ENGINES AT 80%

621
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,248
Dr. Smith: THERE'S NO CARDIOPULMONARY

622
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:06,351
OR RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS.

623
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,061
CLEAR.

624
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:20,164
AGAIN. CLEAR.

625
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,405
Computer: ALERT.

626
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,908
MEDICAL.

627
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:32,076
Computer: REROUTING ERROR.

628
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:34,712
SYSTEMS ARE CRASHING.

629
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,447
JUDY.

630
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,916
WE'RE LOSING HER.

631
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:40,585
DO SOMETHING.

632
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,495
COME ON, CHILD.

633
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:52,863
PUT...

634
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,833
PUT A LITTLE HEART INTO IT.

635
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:59,537
THE OTHER LIFE I SAVE

636
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,773
WILL BE MY OWN.

637
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,244
Maureen: WAKE UP, BABY, PLEASE.

638
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,314
THAT'S ALL THE POWER WE'VE GOT.

639
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,750
I'M PUTTING THE PEDAL TO THE METAL. HERE GOES.

640
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,333
SHE CAN'T BREAK FREE.

641
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,335
SHE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH THRUST.

642
00:34:31,468 --> 00:34:34,505
THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY TO GET THROUGH THIS.

643
00:34:34,638 --> 00:34:36,774
THAT'S IT.

644
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,546
Don: IT'S WORKING!

645
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,148
WHAT IS?

646
00:34:44,281 --> 00:34:45,616
IF WE CAN'T GO AROUND THE SUN,

647
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:47,051
THEN WE GO STRAIGHT THROUGH IT

648
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:48,319
USING YOUR HYPERDRIVE.

649
00:34:48,452 --> 00:34:51,054
ENGAGE THE HYPERDRIVE WITHOUT A GATE?

650
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:53,090
WE COULD BE THROWN ANYWHERE IN THE GALAXY.

651
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,592
ANYWHERE BUT HERE.

652
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,733
ON MY MARK.

653
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,572
3, 2,

654
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,441
ONE, INITIATE.

655
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:37,868
John: HYPERDRIVE AT 100%.

656
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:41,005
MAJOR, YOU HAVE THE COM.

657
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:43,607
Will: DAD?

658
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,909
DAD!

659
00:35:46,076 --> 00:35:49,213
LET'S SEE WHAT THIS BABY CAN DO.

660
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:55,920
WILL!

661
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,884
MAUREEN, EVERYONE?

662
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:29,587
JUDY. WHERE IS JUDY?

663
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,521
SHE'S OK.

664
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:31,622
Dr. Smith: YES, SHE IS...

665
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:34,592
THANKS TO ME.

666
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,193
Judy: HERE I AM.

667
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:38,429
EITHER I SHOULD CUT DOWN ON THE LIQUIDS,

668
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:39,930
OR I SHOULD SEW IN A NEW FLAP

669
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,231
BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY HELL

670
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,867
GETTING OUT OF THAT THING.

671
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,201
YOU'RE...

672
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:45,402
VITALS ARE NORMAL.

673
00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:46,804
PULSE AND RESPIRATION SEEM TO BE.

674
00:36:46,937 --> 00:36:47,804
HEY, ARE YOU OK?

675
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:48,806
I'M FINE, REALLY.

676
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:50,307
COME HERE.

677
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,277
WILL EVERY LITTLE PROBLEM BE AN EXCUSE

678
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,213
FOR FAMILIAL SENTIMENT?

679
00:36:59,082 --> 00:37:00,484
HOW MUCH, SMITH?

680
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:03,220
WHAT WAS THE PRICE TAG

681
00:37:03,353 --> 00:37:07,525
THAT YOU PUT ON OUR FUTURE?

682
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:10,461
HUH?

683
00:37:10,594 --> 00:37:12,430
HUH?

684
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,907
YOU CAN'T DO IT, CAN YOU, JOHN?

685
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:28,980
YOU CAN'T KILL THE MAN WITHOUT BECOMING THE MONSTER.

686
00:37:37,988 --> 00:37:39,423
COWARD.

687
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,899
WHAT'S HAPPENED, JOHN?

688
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:50,334
WHERE ARE WE?

689
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,942
I BYPASSED MOST OF THE DAMAGED SYSTEMS.

690
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:03,380
WE'LL HAVE TO REPAIR THE REST MANUALLY.

691
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,981
YOU HAD ME WORRIED, DOC.

692
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:06,817
NICE TO SEE YOU THAWED.

693
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,587
YOU HAVE A PUZZLING DEFINITION OF A SMOOTH RIDE.

694
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:15,426
COMPUTER, MAP-- OUR CURRENT POSITION.

695
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:19,463
Computer: SEARCHING FOR RECOGNIZABLE CONSTELLATIONS.

696
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:24,335
THIS DATABASE...

697
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,837
HAS STAR MAPS OF ALL THE KNOWN GALAXY.

698
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,473
I DON'T RECOGNIZE A SINGLE SYSTEM.

699
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:34,178
WE'RE LOST....

700
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,880
AREN'T WE?

701
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:51,027
Don: UHH!

702
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:53,296
AAH! EASY, DOC. GOD.

703
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,865
OH, PLEASE.

704
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:58,302
THE CRYOSUIT ABSORBED MOST OF THE ELECTRICAL CHARGE.

705
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:00,338
YOU'RE LUCKY THIS WASN'T YOUR HIDE.

706
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:04,241
DOCTOR, IS THAT CONCERN I DETECT IN YOUR VOICE?

707
00:39:04,374 --> 00:39:06,443
OW!

708
00:39:06,576 --> 00:39:08,979
GREAT BEDSIDE MANNER.

709
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:13,117
Judy: WHAT'S THAT?

710
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,918
A BATTLE SCAR?

711
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:17,521
SORT OF.

712
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:20,457
IT WAS A TATTOO.

713
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:24,628
AN EX-GIRLFRIEND'S NAME, BUT I HAD IT REMOVED.

714
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:28,198
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER TO USE A MAGIC MARKER?

715
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:30,500
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S ME.

716
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,070
A GIRL IN EVERY PORT.

717
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:34,671
SO, MAJOR, NO FAMILY?

718
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,674
NOTHING TO TIE YOU DOWN, NO ONE TO MISS?

719
00:39:37,807 --> 00:39:41,445
NAH, I'VE NEVER BEEN THE FIT-IN AND PLAY-NICE TYPE.

720
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,215
I GUESS YOU THINK THAT'S ROMANTIC.

721
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:47,718
NO.

722
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,453
NO, I DON'T.

723
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:52,757
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU, DOC?

724
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,627
IS THERE SOME LUCKY LITTLE NERD YOU LEFT BEHIND?

725
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,229

01:07:56,204 --> 01:07:59,207
LIFE SUPPORT IS MARGINAL.

1095
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:00,509
IT'S GONNA GET COLD IN HERE TONIGHT.

1096
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:03,746
ALSO, THE POD AND THE CHARIOT

1097
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,381
ARE PRETTY MUCH SCRAP METAL.

1098
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:07,148
DON'T YOU WALK AWAY FROM ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU.

1099
01:08:07,282 --> 01:08:09,150
GIVE IT A REST, PROFESSOR.

1100
01:08:09,284 --> 01:08:10,852
I WAS TECHNICALLY STILL IN COMMAND.

1101
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,622
I AM COMMANDER OF THIS MISSION.

1102
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:14,824
LOOK, NO OFFENSE,

1103
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:17,793
BUT YOU'RE AN EGGHEAD WITH AN HONORARY RANK.

1104
01:08:17,926 --> 01:08:18,994
NO ONE EVER INTENDED FOR YOU

1105
01:08:19,127 --> 01:08:20,862
TO HANDLE COMBAT SITUATIONS.

1106
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:22,964
YOU HANDLED IT BRILLIANTLY,

1107
01:08:23,098 --> 01:08:24,266
SENDING US CRASHING DOWN HERE.

1108
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:27,770
THOSE ALIENS POSED A CONTINUING THREAT.

1109
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:29,238
I MADE A JUDGMENT CALL,

1110
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:31,807
AND, IF I HAVE TO, I'LL MAKE IT AGAIN.

1111
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:33,742
HELL, YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT.

1112
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:35,243
IF YOUR FATHER WERE HERE, HE'D BACK ME UP.

1113
01:08:35,376 --> 01:08:36,478
MY FATHER IS DEAD,

1114
01:08:36,611 --> 01:08:39,714
KILLED IN ONE OF THOSE COMBAT MISSIONS

1115
01:08:39,848 --> 01:08:41,216
THAT YOU ADMIRE SO MUCH.

1116
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:42,551
MY FAMILY IS ON THIS SHIP,

1117
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:44,019
AND YOU WILL FOLLOW MY ORDERS,

1118
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,020
WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THEM OR NOT.

1119
01:08:45,153 --> 01:08:46,154
IS THAT CLEAR, MAJOR?

1120
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:47,690
HEY, SAVE YOUR SPEECHES.

1121
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,525
I LIKE YOU, BUT I'M GONNA DO WHATEVER I THINK IT TAKES

1122
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,260
TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION,

1123
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:54,129
WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR HELP. IS THAT CLEAR, PROFESSOR?

1124
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:56,131
AM I INTERRUPTING SOMETHING?

1125
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:58,667
NO, REALLY.

1126
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,203
I THINK YOU TWO SHOULD GO AHEAD AND SLUG IT OUT.

1127
01:09:02,871 --> 01:09:05,674
I MEAN, HERE WE ARE, STRANDED ON AN ALIEN WORLD,

1128
01:09:05,807 --> 01:09:08,009
AND YOU BOYS WANT TO GET INTO A PISSING CONTEST?

1129
01:09:08,143 --> 01:09:10,546
PLEASE, GO FOR IT.

1130
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,815
I'LL HAVE JUDY DOWN HERE IN A HEARTBEAT

1131
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:13,983
TO DECLARE YOU BOTH UNFIT,

1132
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:15,417
AND I'LL TAKE OVER THIS MISSION.

1133
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:17,252
NOW, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER WORD FROM YOU.

1134
01:09:17,385 --> 01:09:18,454
IS THAT CLEAR?

1135
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:19,254
MAUREEN--

1136
01:09:19,387 --> 01:09:22,557
NOT...ANOTHER WORD.

1137
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:23,692
BETTER.

1138
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,161
NOW, IF YOU'VE FINISHED

1139
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:27,563
HOSING DOWN THE DECKS WITH TESTOSTERONE,

1140
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:29,631
I SUGGEST YOU COME WITH ME.

1141
01:09:29,764 --> 01:09:31,934
I MAY HAVE FOUND A WAY TO GET US OFF THIS PLANET.

1142
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:36,871
WOW.

1143
01:09:37,005 --> 01:09:38,908
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

1144
01:09:50,952 --> 01:09:51,954
[BEEP BEEP]

1145
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:17,646
[GROANING]

1146
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,481
DAMN BUG BITE.

1147
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:38,500
HMM. SHE...

1148
01:10:38,633 --> 01:10:41,703
SHE REALLY IS AN INTERESTING SPECIMEN.

1149
01:10:41,836 --> 01:10:42,437
HUH, DOC?

1150
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,306
SHE'S FASCINATING.

1151
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,376
THE RETINAL APERTURE DILATION

1152
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:50,145
SEEMS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE SKIN PIGMENTATION.

1153
01:10:50,278 --> 01:10:52,180
JUDY. JUDY.

1154
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,650
WHAT?

1155
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:57,786
CAN I KEEP HER?

1156
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:02,658
PENNY, SHE'S NOT JUST ANOTHER FAD

1157
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,393
THAT YOU CAN JUST PICK UP AND THROW AWAY.

1158
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:07,062
OH, PLEASE.

1159
01:11:07,195 --> 01:11:08,330
LOOK, SHE'S ALL ALONE HERE,

1160
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:10,332
AND I PROMISE I'LL LOOK OUT FOR HER.

1161
01:11:10,465 --> 01:11:12,501
I PROMISE.

1162
01:11:15,637 --> 01:11:17,673
SHE...SHE KIND OF NEEDS ME.

1163
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,212
THE MINUTE THAT YOU MISPLACE HER,

1164
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:24,313
THAT YOU FORGET TO FEED HER--

1165
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,482
DON'T SMILE. I MEAN IT, PEN.

1166
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,618
THANKS...DOC.

1167
01:11:32,587 --> 01:11:35,190
WE'RE BOTH A LONG WAY FROM HOME,

1168
01:11:35,323 --> 01:11:36,724
AREN'T WE, LITTLE ONE?

1169
01:11:36,858 --> 01:11:38,060
[BLARP]

1170
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:41,963
BLARP?

1171
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:44,667
[BLARP]

1172
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:48,570
THAT'S WHAT WE'LL CALL YOU,

1173
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,439
BLARP.

1174
01:11:56,044 --> 01:11:57,245
NICE GIRL.

1175
01:11:57,378 --> 01:11:59,315
PRETTY GIRL.

1176
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,557
Penny: NICE.

1177
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:16,031
Maureen: THE ATMOSPHERE HERE CAN SUSTAIN HUMAN LIFE.

1178
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:19,835
I'VE LOCATED 500 RADS OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL

1179
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:21,603
5 MILES WEST.

1180
01:12:21,736 --> 01:12:22,804
WE'LL NEED AT LEAST THAT MUCH

1181
01:12:22,937 --> 01:12:24,539
TO GET THE CORE FUNCTIONING AGAIN.

1182
01:12:24,672 --> 01:12:27,476
WE START OUT AT DAYBREAK.

1183
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:32,514
BE SAFER THAT WAY.

1184
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:37,486
THOSE ARE MY ORDERS, MAJOR.

1185
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,896
I AGREE WITH YOUR RECOMMENDATION, PROFESSOR.

1186
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:50,966
DáTENTE'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.

1187
01:12:56,838 --> 01:12:58,406
OH, MAJOR.

1188
01:12:58,539 --> 01:12:59,741
WELL, IT'S NICE TO SEE

1189
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,176
YOU FOUND A CALLING TO SUIT YOUR TALENTS.

1190
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,278
TURN DOWN THE BED BEFORE YOU LEAVE.

1191
01:13:03,411 --> 01:13:05,814
I GAVE MY WORD I'D LET YOU LIVE.

1192
01:13:07,348 --> 01:13:08,450
I NEVER SAID FOR HOW LONG.

1193
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:11,853
FAMILY HOUR IS OVER, MAJOR.

1194
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:13,688
WE'RE DYING HERE.

1195
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:17,158
ROBINSON IS OUT OF HIS LEAGUE.

1196
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:19,594
LOOK INTO HIS EYES AND TELL ME

1197
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:21,930
YOU CAN'T SEE HIS FEAR.

1198
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:27,235
I FOUGHT IN THE MILLENNIAL WARS, MAJOR.

1199
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,803
SURVIVAL IS A SOLDIER'S GAME.

1200
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:31,406
WE BOTH KNOW THAT THIS CIVILIAN FOOL

1201
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,573
WILL LEAD US STRAIGHT TO HELL.

1202
01:13:32,707 --> 01:13:36,177
ROBINSON NEEDS OUR HELP,

1203
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:37,813
IF HE WANTS IT OR NOT.

1204
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:40,449
WITH MINIMAL FORCE, WE COULD TAKE THIS SHIP

1205
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:41,650
AND ASSURE THEM THAT WE SHALL CONTINUE

1206
01:13:41,783 --> 01:13:43,652
UNDER YOUR COMMAND.

1207
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,254
OF COURSE.

1208
01:13:46,387 --> 01:13:48,857
MY GOD, SMITH...

1209
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:50,692
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1210
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:53,362
HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO BLIND.

1211
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:54,362
I'LL JUST RUN

1212
01:13:54,495 --> 01:13:55,497
AND GET YOU A GUN

1213
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:59,067
SO WE CAN HIJACK THE SHIP, OK?

1214
01:14:00,902 --> 01:14:03,738
SARCASM IS THE RECOURSE OF THE WEAK MIND.

1215
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:07,942
OOH. I'M HIDING THE PAIN.

1216
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:09,077
REALLY.

1217
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:13,715
LOCK.

1218
01:14:17,585 --> 01:14:21,156
YOUR PAIN, MAJOR...

1219
01:14:21,289 --> 01:14:22,825
HAS JUST BEGUN.

1220
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,832
STARLIGHT, STAR BRIGHT.

1221
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:36,638
A MILLION STRANGE STARS, AND ONLY ONE WISH.

1222
01:14:36,771 --> 01:14:38,574
I WISH WE WERE HOME.

1223
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:43,645
NEVER SEEN A SKY LOOK SO ALIEN.

1224
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:46,515
WE REALLY ARE LOST, AREN'T WE?

1225
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:55,424
WHEN THE FIRST SAILORS CIRCLED THE GLOBE,

1226
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:58,526
SAW A BRAND-NEW SKY,

1227
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,928
THEY THOUGHT THEY'D SAILED

1228
01:15:00,061 --> 01:15:01,896
RIGHT OFF THE EDGE OF THE EARTH,

1229
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,966
BUT THEY WERE REALLY JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

1230
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:08,436
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE SHOULD JUST BILLOW OUR SAILS

1231
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,171
AND LET THE WIND TAKE US HOME?

1232
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:11,773
IS THAT IT, MAJOR?

1233
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:15,277
SO THOSE SAILORS...

1234
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:20,549
FOUND FAMILIAR SHAPES...

1235
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,917
IN THE STARS...

1236
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:26,154
TO MAKE THE SKY SEEM MORE FRIENDLY

1237
01:15:26,287 --> 01:15:27,722
AND TO HELP THEM FIND THEIR WAY HOME.

1238
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,491
THAT'S HOW THE CONSTELLATIONS

1239
01:15:29,624 --> 01:15:30,959
WERE BORN.

1240
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:35,564
PORKY THE WISE AND MIGHTY PIG.

1241
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:55,117
THE GREAT...

1242
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:57,553
BIG-EARED BUNNY BUGS.

1243
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:04,593
AHEM.

1244
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,263
YOU KNOW, THE WAY YOU GOT US DOWN HERE,

1245
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:10,866
THAT WAS PRETTY FLYING.

1246
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:20,309
SO, MY QUARTERS OR YOURS?

1247
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:22,243
EXCUSE ME?

1248
01:16:22,376 --> 01:16:24,846
DON'T PLAY COY.

1249
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,448
WE'RE THE ONLY SINGLE MAN AND WOMAN

1250
01:16:26,581 --> 01:16:28,083
OF CONSENTING AGE IN THE GALAXY.

1251
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:30,819
HOW MUCH MORE OF A SETUP DO YOU NEED?

1252
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:34,622
SO YOU FIGURE, WHY NOT JUST...

1253
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:35,824
DISPENSE WITH THE PLEASANTRIES

1254
01:16:35,957 --> 01:16:37,058
AND GET DOWN TO BUSINESS?

1255
01:16:37,191 --> 01:16:40,729
YOU HAVE A WAY WITH WORDS, DOCTOR.

1256
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:44,165
DO YOU WANT TO SHOW ME HOW YOU HANDLE THE HELM?

1257
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,268
YEAH.

1258
01:16:49,003 --> 01:16:51,372
RIGHT HERE ON THIS CONSOLE?

1259
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:54,009
UH...

1260
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:58,680
YEAH, RIGHT HERE WOULD BE FINE.

1261
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:11,193
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HANG ON TO YOUR JOYSTICK?

1262
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,938
EXCELLENT TECHNIQUE, MAJOR.

1263
01:17:24,672 --> 01:17:25,874
REALLY.

1264
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:30,311
[DOOR OPENS]

1265
01:17:30,444 --> 01:17:31,846
HEY. HI.

01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:34,416
Maureen: WILL WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

1267
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:37,986
YEAH. I SENT HIM BACK TO HIS ROOM.

1268
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:41,590
HE'S DECIDED HE CAN REBUILD THE ROBOT.

1269
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,425
MMM.

1270
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:46,762
HE WANTS TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT AND SHOW ME HIS DESIGNS.

1271
01:17:47,561 --> 01:17:49,764
