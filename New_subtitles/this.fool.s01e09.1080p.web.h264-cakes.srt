1
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,130
Ugh, don't start, please.

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,007
Too early in the morning for that.

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,112
Why are you in such a good mood anyway?

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,822
'Cause I'm about to graduate.

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,199
This is my last delivery.

6
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,517
Guess I'm gonna have to
find a new jale after this.

7
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,746
I can't believe I'm actually gonna
miss your annoying ass around here.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,914
Oh, yeah?

9
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,190
Nope. Bitch-ass parasite.

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,253
Fuckity... fuck you, homey.

11
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,505
Just hold those.

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,530
Hurry up.

13
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,698
Whoa!

14
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,554
God... damn!

15
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,913
Shit. Sorry, guys.

16
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,308
Uh, my alarm didn't go off.

17
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,185
You're sleeping in the cupcake van?

18
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,645
Yeah, just the last couple of weeks.

19
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,105
Hey, g... Give me a minute.
Let me get decent.

20
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,440
Yeah, yeah. Take your time.

21
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,465
Thank you.

22
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,488
Can you believe that shit?

23
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,305
Fuck, no. That verga was massive.

24
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,951
Shit was like a machete
you cut down trees with.

25
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,494
I'm worried about that fool.

26
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,246
I think he has elephantiasis.

27
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,521
That didn't look natural.

28
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,065
You think he got
dick enlargement surgery?

29
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,110
- With what money?
- He's sleeping in the van.

30
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,071
Well, maybe that's where
he spent all his feria.

31
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,674
That's a good point.

32
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,908
Man, you think you know a guy.

33
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,027
It's been a rough couple of months.

34
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,863
The oven's been acting up,

35
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:38,408
we couldn't fulfill a few orders,
that created a cash flow problem.

36
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,535
So I've been sinking
my own money into the place,

37
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,811
and my ex-wife evicted me.

38
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,165
I'm sorry you had to find out
this way, Julio.

39
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,333
Lord knows I've tried
to shelter you from the truth.

40
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,003
- No, you haven't.
- You constantly complain about money,

41
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,337
and my paychecks are always late.

42
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,463
Luckily, I learned

43
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,882
it takes like four months

44
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,508
before the phone company realizes

45
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,218
that you aren't paying any bills.

46
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,970
I'm a little worried
about the electricity,

47
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,538
but so far those fuckers
haven't turned us off yet.

48
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,058
And now we're out of soap!

49
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,935
I can't even take a whore's bath.

50
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,253
Pass me some paper towels, please.

51
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,859
Well, what about our
big donor Stan what's-his-name?

52
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,152
No, I don't want that prick's money.

53
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,570
We got into a big fight

54
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,406
about his bullshit new stadium
in Inglewood

55
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,950
and how it's displacing
working-class people.

56
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:21,975
So he pulled the funding.

57
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,370
Payne, why'd you piss that fool off?

58
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,997
He's been donating to us for years.

59
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,167
All billionaires are pigs, Julio.

60
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,252
I'm tired of begging for their scraps.

61
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,462
Jesus, Payne, I get that you don't like

62
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,838
groveling to the rich,

63
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,923
but you run a nonprofit.

64
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,407
Suck it up and learn
how to fuckin' tap dance.

65
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,162
Happy?

66
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,393
What about this one? It's got a balcony.

67
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,437
Great. I can jump off of it
when I lose my job

68
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,939
and I can't pay my half of the rent.

69
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,316
- Dude, shut up.
- It's not that expensive.

70
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,425
There's a $500 pet deposit.

71
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,369
You think Roger's worth that much?

72
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:01,598
Roger, are you worth $500?

73
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,662
Please don't make that voice.

74
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,580
- Wait. Shut up, shut up.
- Shut up.

75
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,290
I wanna watch this.

76
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,834
My law firm represents this douche.

77
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:11,835
Richard Rowell,

78
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,962
scion of the controversial Rowell family,

79
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,714
inherited billions of dollars
from his parents

80
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,783
who made their fortune
through owning for-profit prisons.

81
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,346
Richard has been charged with
a number of DUIs over the years,

82
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,373
but always escaped legal consequences
until recently.

83
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,728
I remember where I was
when my lawyer first told me

84
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:35,400
that he got me off scot-free
off of my seventh DUI.

85
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,987
I was in my jacuzzi,
you know, jets on blast.

86
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,822
And I thought,
"Something doesn't feel right."

87
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,349
So I shut off the jets
and I felt much better.

88
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,037
And then I thought,
"You know what else doesn't feel right?"

89
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,730
What my lawyer is saying.

90
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,916
So I told him.

91
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,044
"No. I belong in jail."

92
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,048
So that's when I decided to lock myself up

93
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,158
in one of my parents' prisons.

94
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,220
No mames. These fools make me sick.

95
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,722
We over bill him all the time,

96
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,808
but he has so much money
he never even notices.

97
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,961
I was in prison for a month,
but it was a 31-day month,

98
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:17,108
and every day is like a week
when you're doing hard time.

99
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:21,428
So really it was 31 weeks,
which is almost a year.

100
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,658
God. Yeah, and I mean, it was
less time than what Mandela did,

101
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,536
but it was more time
than what Shia LaBeouf did.

102
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,579
Oh, come on.

103
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:34,083
We have an enormous problem
with mass incarceration in this country.

104
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,418
Okay, in our foundation,

105
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,212
what we wanna do is
we wanna take a stand

106
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:40,381
because we feel privileged
to be privileged enough

107
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:44,326
to help the least privileged members
of our society.

108
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:48,223
Hey, bet these guilty rich fucks
would donate to Hugs Not Thugs.

109
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,141
Yeah, they probably would.

110
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,227
I could put you guys in touch.
My boss is tight with his publicist.

111
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,937
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

112
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,230
That'd be great.

113
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,689
Payne's really losing it.

114
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,983
I gotta step up
and show that fool how it's done.

115
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,819
I'm gonna make this happen for you.

116
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,262
Thanks, boss. That'd be dope.

117
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,199
I don't know what else to put.

118
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,450
What was your last job?

119
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,868
Well, I babysit my nephews, you know,

120
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,787
and I helped my tía
and my grandma around the house.

121
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,646
Put "childcare and hospitality."

122
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,376
Hey, but what do I put for special skills?

123
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,484
What can you do?

124
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,409
Yeah.

125
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,888
Just put Microsoft Word.

126
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,098
Minister Payne.

127
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,808
You know those billionaires
I was telling you about?

128
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,310
They wanna come by and get a tour
and see what we're all about.

129
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,771
Oh, hell, yeah, my boy!

130
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,149
I never met billionaires before.

131
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,775
I got a lot of questions for those fools.

132
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,194
Those fuckers are only coming
for the photo op.

133
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,780
They'll leave giving us
nothing more than pennies.

134
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,658
I'd rather focus
on increasing cupcake sales

135
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,244
or win a fucking scratch-off
for once in my life.

136
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,246
Payne, stop being a little bitch.

137
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,789
Look, I'll do all the work.

138
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,441
All you have to do is
show up, smile, and look pretty.

139
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,212
Fine. I'll fuckin' do it.

140
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,697
So let's get you
some new clothes, and an iron.

141
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,758
It's good if I look like shit.

142
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,594
We're supposed to look like we need money.

143
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:08,761
Yeah, but not that bad.

144
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,847
Crease your fuckin' pants, playboy.

145
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,056
You look like a fuckin' bum.

146
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,708
I am a fuckin' bum. I live in a van.

147
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,048
You will not fuckin' beat box
for those billionaires.

148
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,324
Luis, come on, take that banner down.

149
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,075
We can't make it seem like
it's all about the money.

150
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,286
Hey, well, what if we just cross off
everything after "Bill"?

151
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,705
That could work. Because, you know,
Bill's short for Richard.

152
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,916
No, stupid. Bill's short for William.

153
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,626
The short form of Richard is Dick.

154
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,253
Well, there ain't nothing short
about Payne's Richard.

155
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,863
Honestly, I think I got PTSD
from seeing that thing.

156
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,383
Okay, Julio, here I am,

157
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,762
ready to be the smiling face
of the organization.

158
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,413
- Dawg, come on.
- Your shirt has fuckin' holes in it.

159
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,708
Fabian, give Payne your shirt.

160
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,686
It's my best shirt.

161
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,313
Yeah, Julio, it's his best shirt.

162
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,097
Stop fuckin' around
and give him the shirt.

163
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,134
Oh, shit, ghetto bird!

164
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:12,450
Alright, everyone, the future
of Hugs Not Thugs depends on today.

165
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:16,621
So act reformed, but we need their money,
so not too reformed.

166
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,481
Hey, you ready to kiss some ass?

167
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:35,831
Hey, everyone, please meet
Richard and Rhonda Rowell.

168
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,565
It's through the generosity
of people like you

169
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,525
that a place like this is able to survive.

170
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,277
Aw. Well, thank you for having us.

171
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,219
I mean, we are just so happy to be here.

172
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,406
Yeah, I've had a small taste

173
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,907
of what everyone here has been through.

174
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,392
So I feel great empathy for your pain.

175
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,914
- Whoa!
- Dominic, no, no need for that today.

176
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,625
That's okay. They're reformed.
Harmless now.

177
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,045
Hello. I'm Luis Hernandez,
future entrepreneur.

178
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,487
- Well, alright!
- Nice to meet you.

179
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,885
Luis is a shining example
of our program.

180
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,219
Hey, but on the real though,

181
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,329
how'd you guys come up on all that money?

182
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,976
Luis, our resident joker.

183
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,269
It's okay. I don't mind him asking.

184
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,087
I inherited all my money from my parents.

185
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,025
Damn. That's smart.

186
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:30,153
Let me introduce you
to our fearless leader,

187
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,322
Minister Leonard Payne.

188
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,824
He really gives everything
he has to the program.

189
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,911
No matter how frustrating
a situation might be,

190
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,788
he selflessly does
what he's supposed to do

191
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,397
for the greater good.

192
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,191
Always.

193
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,836
Nice to meet you both.

194
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,255
- Oh, come here.
- Oh, nice to meet you. What?

195
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,549
- You're a great man.
- Hmm.

196
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,635
We read all about you
on the helicopter ride over.

197
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,137
- An angel in human form.
- That's what we're looking at.

198
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,138
Mm-hmm.

199
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,362
- We should do some photos.
- Oh, let's get some photos.

200
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:02,918
Smile.

201
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,421
Hey, let's take a tour.

202
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,691
This is our computer lab.

203
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,693
We make do with what we have.

204
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,322
But the truth is, we have more applicants
than we can service at this facility.

205
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,826
And as you can see,
we're sorely in need of new technology.

206
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,311
Damn, these outdated computers
just won't load.

207
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,439
Wish we weren't working on Windows 95.

208
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,366
If only I had a new job,

209
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,970
I would be able to get a computer

210
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,972
and then I would get a new job.

211
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,015
And I would never go back to prison.

212
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,958
Before Hugs Not Thugs,

213
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,436
I didn't even have what computers were.

214
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,522
We need computers for the Internet.

215
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,316
Uh, you know, with Internet and computers,

216
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,260
we could connect more
and you could follow me.

217
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,762
Thugs Not Hugs is a great place.

218
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,599
But we need money
from kind rich white people.

219
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,911
No, no, I'm sorry,
all people are the same.

220
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,562
I'm not racist for computers.

221
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:08,233
Computers is the future and we need
some new computers 'cause these are,

222
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,944
you know, they're no good.

223
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,781
Recidivism. Thank you.

224
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:17,201
- Bravo.
- Oh! Great.

225
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,745
On with the tour.

226
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,166
These pieces are done
by our huggers in their art therapy class.

227
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,603
Absolutely amazing work.

228
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:30,106
Oh, my God.
I love this one of the crying peasant.

229
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,566
That one's cool, I guess.

230
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,758
But have you seen this one?

231
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,613
It's a Luis Hernandez original.

232
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,824
Well, you are very good at drawing, Luis.

233
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,951
- Seems like a wonderful young lady.
- Mm-hmm.

234
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,060
Yeah, she's nice.

235
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:47,290
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Cool it with the fuckin' flash.

236
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,732
Gonna give me a seizure.

237
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,214
Uh, Luis, why don't you show our guests
our tattoo removal center?

238
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,489
Ooh!

239
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,282
- Right this way.
- Okay.

240
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,553
Hey, so I hear you guys own an island.

241
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,455
Maybe I could be your cabana boy,
but not in a weird way.

242
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,083
Get your fuckin' head in the game.

243
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,977
We're gonna get that money.

244
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:12,899
Now do what you do best
and be empathetic as fuck.

245
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:16,009
Tell me you're gonna give 'em
that Minister Payne magic.

246
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:19,739
I'm gonna give them
that Minister Payne magic.

247
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,014
Damn right.

248
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,413
...and by the time I got parole,

249
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,689
I had missed so much.

250
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,440
I was a grandmother.

251
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,628
This place has helped me
get back on track.

252
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:38,031
But I've had to accept
that my daughter'd never forgive me

253
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,368
for all those years I was away.

254
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,279
Thank you for sharing, Kim.

255
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,832
Would anyone else like to share
in our circle of trust?

256
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,024
Um, how about you, Richard?

257
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,193
I-I know you served time as well.

258
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,178
No, I was only in prison for a month.

259
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,365
I know it doesn't compare
to what you've all been through.

260
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,118
- Oh, that's a really good point.
- Hold up, Minister Payne.

261
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,020
Aren't you the one that's always saying
all trauma is valid?

262
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,691
I do say that, don't I?

263
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,420
Yeah, and, uh, and while it's true

264
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:19,698
that Richard's had a very different life
than the rest of us, um,

265
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,118
I'm sure he's experienced
his own unique version of trauma.

266
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,098
So, please tell us,
what was it like growing up

267
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:30,518
the child of some of
the wealthiest people on Earth?

268
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,728
Well, I...

269
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:37,090
I, uh, felt a sense of... guilt.

270
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,029
You know, like I didn't deserve
the extreme privilege

271
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,780
that I was born into.

272
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,491
It's very brave of you to say that.

273
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,951
Yeah, my parents owned a lot of prisons.

274
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,080
Many of you probably served time
in one of my parents' prisons,

275
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,373
but that's neither here nor there.

276
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,335
Anyway, they were so busy
keeping inmates in check

277
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,487
that they basically just let me run wild.

278
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,965
The world was my playground.

279
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,926
You know, I just got away with everything.

280
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,201
So deep down,

281
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,247
I feel like maybe

282
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,768
I deserved to be punished.

283
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,102
- Aw.
- Ah, man, come on.

284
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,521
Mm.

285
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,648
I'd say it sounds like
you've been punished enough.

286
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,508
I mean, kids need boundaries,

287
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,736
clearly, you had none.

288
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,115
I mean, I-I did have a trust fund
and an international passport...

289
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,534
But you didn't know love,

290
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,643
and you certainly didn't know consequence.

291
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,540
Some people here had no parents,
had no money,

292
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,066
but I don't think anybody
would want to trade places with you.

293
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,151
Wow!

294
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,696
- You mean that?
- Yes.

295
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:44,050
You are a victim, Richard.

296
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,869
You deserve love as much as anybody.

297
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,707
Life just isn't fair, you know.

298
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,252
You know, they call us huggers
for a reason.

299
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,421
Come on, everyone.

300
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,400
- You deserve it.
- That's so nice. Thank you.

301
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,443
Come on, spread the love with hugs.

302
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,468
Mm.

303
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,680
And smile. Everyone, everyone, smile.

304
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:08,891
Payne?

305
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,602
Smile.

306
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,427
And first we have a baby spinach salad

307
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,387
with grilled smoked peaches.

308
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:33,600
Then for the main course, we have
Wagyu beef with a seared foie gras.

309
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,435
I ain't gonna fuck around, goddamn it.

310
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,813
I'm salivating just thinking about
all this scrumptious-ass food.

311
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,037
Y'all lucky I don't eat all this shit
my goddamn myself.

312
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:45,153
Now please, enjoy the bounty of my labor.

313
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:48,156
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Looks delicious.

314
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,074
- Well, all that crying has me famished.
- Oh.

315
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,868
If you don't mind, just help me out here.

316
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,746
Is this a salad fork or a dinner fork?

317
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,080
I can never tell which is which.

318
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,564
- Yeah.
- Such a gas.

319
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,359
You know which fork it is.

320
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:01,920
Pardon me?

321
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,255
I said, you know
which fuckin' fork it is,

322
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,615
you billionaire Illuminati fuck.

323
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,637
You people know
all about fancy fuckin' forks

324
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,805
and fancy fuckin' spoons.

325
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:17,668
And I am sick to death
of sucking up to monsters like you!

326
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,980
We don't need
your fucking nickels and dimes.

327
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,190
We're doing just fine.

328
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:26,885
So fuck you and fuck the helicopter horse
you rode in on!

329
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,973
Fuckin' electric company!

330
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:48,532
I completely understand
if you don't want to stay for dinner.

331
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:51,952
Or donate any money at this point. Um...

332
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,664
Truth is, I've always had resentment
towards rich people.

333
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,851
I've never had any money.

334
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,687
The little money I do have,
I've sunk back into this place

335
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,296
and now I live in the van outside.

336
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:06,776
But the reason I do this is because

337
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,696
I really, really care about helping people

338
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,656
who have nobody at all to fight for them.

339
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,576
Literally, I would do anything
for the people in this program,

340
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,977
so you can hate me,

341
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,582
but, uh, these people
really need your help.

342
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:24,651
And I hope you can find it in your hearts
not to punish the huggers for my behavior.

343
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,489
Well, I mean, the truth is

344
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,618
we deserve to be yelled at.

345
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:37,432
You guys can't even keep the lights on
and we came here in a chopper.

346
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:40,268
I mean, nobody should
have a billion dollars.

347
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,603
It's just, it's-it's too much.

348
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,438
It's too much.

349
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,648
I don't even know how many zeros
are in a billion.

350
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,774
- No.
- Right?

351
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:50,219
- No.
- A billion is like the opposite of zero.

352
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,572
So when you think about it, really,

353
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:55,283
there shouldn't be any zeros in it at all.

354
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,660
Well, I just want to tell you
I'm sorry for what I said.

355
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,287
No, don't you dare be sorry.

356
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,747
We need to hear this stuff.

357
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,707
We wanna hear from all of you,

358
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,459
what you hate about us.

359
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,252
- It's-it's good for us.
- Yes.

360
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,837
- Let's-let's go.
- Come on.

361
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,422
Julio, do you have anything to say?

362
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,865
And, please, just let us have it.

363
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,203
Well, um,

364
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,455
I think you guys are nice.

365
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:23,394
Um, but I do kinda
hate everything you represent.

366
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,063
- Great. That's great.
- I've heard that before.

367
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,481
That is really great.

368
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:29,901
Luis, I mean, you must despise us.
Please don't hold back.

369
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:31,611
Hell, no, I ain't a fuckin' hater.

370
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,029
I'll never pocket watch.

371
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,323
- On the real, you fools are my idols.
- Aw.

372
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,992
Hey, maybe after I
cabana boy for you for a while,

373
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,370
we can become close friends.

374
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,372
Well, that sounds alright to me,
Luis Hernandez.

375
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:43,581
Okay.

376
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:46,876
Thankfully, the gas company
hasn't caught on to us yet.

377
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,837
So dinner is still served.

378
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,548
Oh, look at it. This looks divine!

379
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,323
- Ooh.
- Hope I got the right fork.

380
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:59,347
So I told him,
"Why don't you take your stadium

381
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,225
"and shove it where the sun don't shine?

382
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,145
I'm sure it's gonna fit
'cause you're such a gaping asshole."

383
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,855
Wow.

384
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:08,839
You can't say that to a person!

385
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:11,442
Um, you know, speaking of people
with too much money,

386
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,696
uh, how about we get down to brass tacks?

387
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,822
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

388
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:19,450
Um, how much money
do you think you need

389
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:22,728
to keep this wonderful place afloat?

390
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,147
Oh!

391
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,234
A million dollars.

392
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,616
A million dollars?

393
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,745
I mean, I was thinking
more like ten million.

394
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,307
Ten million?

395
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,685
I don't know how much this all costs,
but it's gotta be a lot, right?

396
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:46,728
You know what?

397
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:50,899
Why do we make it an even 15, gumdrop?

398
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,549
Fifteen million dollars.

399
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,406
And for dessert, our famous cupcakes

400
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,325
made by our very own huggers.

401
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:01,451
- Oh-oh.
- Enjoy.

402
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,495
- Yay!
- Chef.

403
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,913
Oh my!

404
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:06,164
I don't have my glasses. What does it say?

405
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,790
Oh, it says "Hugs Not Thugs."

406
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,417
- "Hugs Not Thugs."
- "Hugs Not Thugs."

407
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,901
- Alright.
- Mm.

408
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,089
- Hmm. I like that.
- Let's do it.

409
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,424
Everybody, wave to the camera.

410
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,783
Everybody wave.

411
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,719
Great. And that's enough.

412
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:20,970
Alright. That's enough. That's enough.

413
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,056
You can both go. Thank you so much.
Wait in the chopper.

414
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,018
Wow, I-I just don't know what to say.

415
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,062
Um, thank you so much for your generosity.

416
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,313
I was wrong about you two.

417
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,815
Wait, we haven't given you
the money yet.

418
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,068
You know, some people consider sweets
a guilty pleasure,

419
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,320
and we don't often indulge in dessert.

420
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:41,449
But my hubby and I,
we have a guilty pleasure of our own.

421
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:46,120
So, I mean, did you want to start
telling them about our little thing?

422
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,563
Yes, I do, Richard.

423
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,254
- Alright, let's go for it.
- Okay, great. Great.

424
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:55,880
- Alright, here we go.
- Okay.

425
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,239
So...

426
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,910
I like it when he watches me
have sex with poor people.

427
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,766
I, um... I love it.

428
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,767
Mm.

429
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,854
We've just recently realized
this is our little kink

430
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,231
'cause he needs to be punished
for his wealth.

431
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,899
- Don't you, Richard? Yeah?
- Yes, I do.

432
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,318
Um, you see, she's the mommy,

433
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,737
one of you is the daddy,

434
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,658
and I'm the naughty little boy
who needs to be punished.

435
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,910
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you fools for real?

436
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,120
- Of course.
- 100%.

437
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,914
Now, the only thing left to decide

438
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:33,233
is which of you peasants
is gonna have sex with me.

439
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,587
I fuckin' knew it.

440
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:37,797
- Hey, pick me. I'm poor as fuck.
- Hmm.

441
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,048
I don't even have a bank account.

442
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,050
And my bed is actually a couch
in my tía's house.

443
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,677
No. You can't do this to us!

444
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:45,263
Okay, just get it over with,
you fuckin' psychos.

445
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:46,872
Which one of us do you want?

446
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,269
Trust me, alright?

447
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:52,812
I might be short,
but I got a lot of energy.

448
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:53,813
It's gonna be a good time.

449
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,190
Wow. Honey, honey, honey, honey.

450
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,192
It is a spoil of poor people riches.

451
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,301
- How will we ever choose?
- I know how, Mommy.

452
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,280
- Can I?
- Yes, you can, little Richie.

453
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,448
Okay.

454
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:05,891
Icka, bicka, soda cracker.

455
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,354
- I love that.
- Icka, bicka, boo.

456
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:14,316
Icka, bicka, soda cracker,

457
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,588
I choose y...

458
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:21,990
One potato, two potato,
three potato, four,

459
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:26,346
five potato, six potato, seven potato.

460
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,600
And will you excuse me, sir?

461
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:34,270
Excuse me.
I want to choose

462
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,815
you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,

463
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,192
you, you, you, you, you,
you, you, you, you.

464
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:40,425
Duck.

465
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,219
Duck.

466
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:44,054
Duck.

467
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,640
- Duck, duck.
- Oh. Hmm.

468
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:48,433
Duck.

469
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,352
Duck.

470
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,539
- This is fun.
- Mm-hmm.

471
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:54,356
Duck.

472
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,864
Duck. Duck.

473
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:04,116
Duck, duck.

474
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:10,807
Di-daddy-dee-goo-gooey.

475
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,852
Do... Goose.

476
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,019
Damn!

477
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,337
I could have been a high-end prostitute.

478
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,983
I just love how you

479
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,443
stood up to us earlier, Minister Payne.

480
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:26,656
I mean, it takes a lot of dignity
to confront the rich.

481
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,658
And I find that dignity

482
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:31,935
is the only thing that poor people have.

483
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,731
So I'm gonna fuck it right outta you.

484
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:37,792
I have a good idea, Mommy.

485
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:40,628
I think we should do it
in that van that he lives in.

486
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:41,713
Oh, the gross van.

487
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:44,781
Oh. Oh, yeah. So dirty. So dirty.

488
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,076
I'm gonna go freshen up.

489
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:50,871
Payne.

490
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,851
Payne!

491
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,479
Fuck these fools!
You don't have to do this.

492
00:22:57,503 --> 00:22:58,605
Thank you for saying that, Julio,

493
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,816
but this organization
is very important to me,

494
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,986
and it's my job to do whatever it takes
to keep it going.

495
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,595
No, fuck that!

496
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:09,932
Julio, it's okay.

497
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,017
Hand me some paper towels.

498
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:18,732
Here.

499
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,407
Thank you, Julio.

500
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:33,389
Damn, Dr. Payne,
you're a fuckin' G today!

501
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,707
I'm jealous, homey. Rhonda's fine as fuck.

502
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:38,520
Thank you, Luis.

503
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:41,922
Now, if you will, a beat, please.

504
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,471
Yeah.

505
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,058
Fuck. I can't believe
he's gonna go through with it.

506
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,228
- Hope he's okay.
- Who, Minister Payne?

507
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,146
With that big-ass camote?

508
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,274
He'll be fine.

509
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,141
It's Rhonda I'm worried about.

510
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:03,503
She's a nice lady, you know.

511
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,727
And after this, she's not
gonna be able to walk anymore.

512
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:09,283
Payne's about to Million Dollar Baby
that billion-dollar pussy, my boy.

513
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,535
Did we get the computers?

514
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,497
Yeah. Carlos, thanks to you,

515
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:18,518
we're about to get a lot of new computers.

516
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:19,751
Yes!
