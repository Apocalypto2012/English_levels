1
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,781
Thank you.

2
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:54,215
Japan was a place
where you could make money.

3
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:59,179
The strategy was to gain economic power.

4
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,930
<i>Thousands of young people
have joined the Unification Church,</i>

5
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,181
<i>which began in Korea.</i>

6
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:28,150
I believe he's a prophet
in a similar position to John the Baptist

7
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,903
to prepare the way
for the Second Coming of Christ.

8
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,212
Long live the true parents!

9
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,422
Long live!

10
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,243
We love our children.
They're beautiful.

11
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,914
They've been the subject
of a strenuous brainwashing exercise

12
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,207
by Moon and his people.

13
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,854
In the battle against communism,

14
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:17,693
Reverend Sun Myung Moon
has launched a crusade on a global scale

15
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:22,155
to bring about the total defeat
of this godless empire of evil.

16
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,848
<i>Reverend Moon faces
an 18-month prison sentence</i>

17
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:51,310
<i>for failing to pay income taxes
on the interest from large sums</i>

18
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,813
<i>of church funds
held in his personal bank accounts.</i>

19
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:03,113
Seems to me that IRS and the government
have overstepped their boundaries

20
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,449
in terms of separation
of church and state.

21
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,639
When I think of <i>The Washington Times,</i>

22
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,810
I think of a publication that has brought
much-needed balance

23
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,063
to the way
Washington is covered these days.

24
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,958
<i>True Father,</i>

25
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:47,003
<i>thank you
for your unparalleled investment.</i>

26
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:56,072
Father, we're so grateful
for the Second Amendment.

27
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,055
Long live the true parents!

28
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,604
The world is getting crazy.

29
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,659
It's all a play, isn't it?

30
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,953
Now that's the truth.
