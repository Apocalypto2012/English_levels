1
00:00:16,997 --> 00:00:19,124
It's the truth, sir.
- Truth, really?

2
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:27,399
It was just me in the riots.
Not my brothers. Let them go.

3
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:34,748
Believe me, it was only me... I'm
not lying sir. I'm not lying sir.

4
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:39,543
Lock him up.

5
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:45,619
Please let my brothers go... they
haven't done anything.

6
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:53,432
Sir I have information. - What?

7
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:56,162
I have information.

8
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:01,167
The city is about to be bombed.

9
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:14,446
Tell me. What? I'm telling the truth.
- Bombs. Mantralaya, Stock Exchange...

10
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:18,788
...Sena Bhavan, they
want to blow them all up.

11
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:22,620
That's bull shit. Who will blow up
Mantralaya, Sena Bhavan?

12
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:25,688
I'm not lying. No, it's the truth.

13
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:28,792
They're using RDX.

14
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:33,533
We smuggled it in. You
know Tiger bhai...?

15
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:36,542
Who?
- Tiger Memon.

16
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:41,474
Who's that? Sir Tiger...
- Yes, who is he?

17
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:43,880
He sent us for training...

18
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,477
They showed how to
make bombs and...

19
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:50,081
...throw grenades, pull
the pin and throw.

20
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:51,821
We learnt it all.

21
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:54,554
Now the Stock Exchange, Mantralaya,
they're going to blow the city up.

22
00:01:56,096 --> 00:02:02,695
Stock Exchange, Mantralaya,
Sena Bhavan...

23
00:02:05,105 --> 00:02:07,573
Blown up by an army
of pricks like you?

24
00:02:10,177 --> 00:02:12,577
I'm not making this up.

25
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:15,581
Look at yourself, you little runt.

26
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,813
Mantralaya, Stock Exchange,
they'll blow them up?

27
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:20,819
You think it's a piece of cake?

28
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:22,913
You think it's a piece of cake?

29
00:02:24,057 --> 00:02:25,217
Shut up.

30
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:30,522
Say another word, and I'll throw
your whole family into jail...

31
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:33,589
You can rot together forever.

32
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:37,530
You think we're morons?

33
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:42,268
Lock him up!

34
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:51,550
"Oh my Khwaja..."

35
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:55,554
"There is a carnival today..."

36
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:59,548
"At the home of the Khwaja..."

37
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:03,962
"He is blessed..."

38
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,091
"He is blessed..."

39
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:14,573
"Salutations to Mohammed..."

40
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:19,237
"It is my Maula's wedding...

41
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:24,174
You know Gullu sold us out...

42
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:28,621
But I swear that's not
going to stop us.

43
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,581
The police think they
still have time.

44
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,722
Like Napoleon we'll be done
and gone before they know it.

45
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:44,603
On Friday, the 12th, the
17th day of Ramadan...

46
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:51,872
The day the Prophet fought the
holy war and won, that day.

47
00:03:55,615 --> 00:04:05,616
BwTorrents. Com

48
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:39,958
What's this?
- T-shirts

49
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,220
You sell T-shirts too? - Of course.

50
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:44,661
Tomorrow's Saturday. The
Stock Exchange is closed.

51
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:47,063
So I sell T-shirts. Come Monday,
it's back to sandwiches.

52
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,397
What is it? Yes, tell me.

53
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:55,799
Greetings.

54
00:04:57,077 --> 00:05:01,013
O Ramesh, Ramesh, I'm
going to take a leak.

55
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:34,081
Hey move! The rest of you
clear out of here.

56
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:38,457
Ask the police to clear the area.

57
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:42,619
Hey clear away everyone from
here. Clear everyone.

58
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:53,028
Move back! Come on!

59
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:11,183
Just check him out!

60
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:28,632
Sir... Century Bazaar is
Completely destroyed.

61
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,733
There's glass shattered
over two kilometers...

62
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:36,309
You checked all the cars in the
area? - We didn't find a thing sir.

63
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:38,680
The jeep, there wasn't much left...

64
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:44,546
Seems at least 80 kilos
of RDX was used here...

65
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:47,058
And another 50 at
the Stock Exchange.

66
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:51,558
Control, come in!
Yeah Sawant speaking.

67
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:53,030
Crime asks Bomb squad to proceed
to Worli... Siemens factory...

68
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:55,397
Suspicious Maruti Van... over...

69
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:28,191
Car bombs used at Stock Exchange,
Plaza Cinema, Air India building

70
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:32,425
Scooter bombs in the market areas

71
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:37,128
Bombs were also planted in the
rooms of three major hotels...

72
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:41,731
We have the names of
the three guests.

73
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:48,213
The death toll has crossed 300...

74
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:53,810
1600 injured are being treated
in the city's hospitals.

75
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:00,355
Brother Is this scooter yours?

76
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:03,160
Watchman...
- Yes sir?

77
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:06,221
Whose scooter is that?
- I don't know, sir.

78
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:22,170
Did you hear about the
Bombay blasts on BBC?

79
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:24,477
Who do you think did it?

80
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:30,318
You said, the Muslims have bled,
you wanted to take revenge.

81
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:36,252
We are talking.
We'll call you. You go.

82
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:40,925
So, what did you do?

83
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:47,535
Those blasts that was me.

84
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:54,577
I got the boys together.
I. I put my money in it.

85
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:59,808
I got the others in as well.

86
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:03,449
The whole plan...

87
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:09,795
You were still planning your trip...

88
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:15,700
And I'd already reached the moon.

89
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:29,439
You won't get away.

90
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:35,253
What do you mean?
- The police...

91
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:39,247
...found a Maruti van at Worli
It was filled with weapons...

92
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:42,659
...and they tracked down the owner.

93
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:46,959
Something wrong?

94
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:18,295
Watchman! - Yes sir.
- Whose scooter is that?

95
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:20,559
I don't know...
- You've asked all the residents?

96
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:24,034
No... - This is no place
to park a scooter.

97
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:25,832
Ask everyone.

98
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:35,312
Sir, it might explode
if you open it.

99
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:46,019
So the moment I saw the
scooter there...

100
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,353
I knew something was wrong.

101
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:51,486
It doesn't belong to
anyone in the area.

102
00:15:51,564 --> 00:15:54,328
Sir, Shut all the shops.

103
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,925
We'll have to evacuate the area.

104
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:07,344
The moment I saw the scooter
I knew something...

105
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:10,405
Thank you. Please leave now.
It's dangerous here.

106
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:11,677
When did you realise...?

107
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:14,584
The moment I saw the scooter...
I knew something was wrong.

108
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:17,782
I immediately asked my watchman.
I asked the neighbours...

109
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:33,370
RDX...

110
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,771
Why didn't it explode?

111
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:39,970
When it was assembled... RDX must
have gotten into the detonator...

112
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:42,037
It blocked the movement
of the striker...

113
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:45,110
Whoever made it wasn't
being very careful.

114
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:47,681
Dangle, get me details
on the scooter.

115
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,482
Sir.

116
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:57,759
Get me something to eat.

117
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:03,493
I want to speak to Dangle

118
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:06,663
We're working on it, but I
Don't think it was stolen.

119
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:12,467
I sent Kambli to track
down the registration.

120
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:14,479
And the Maruti van...?

121
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:17,405
It's registered in the name of
one Rubina Suleiman Memon...

122
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:21,419
Resident of Al Husseini building,
Durgah Road, Mahim.

123
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:34,923
You know the Memons?

124
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,059
Fifth floor. - Come on.

125
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:56,185
Every one's gone away somewhere...?

126
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,480
They've not been here for a while.

127
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,552
Mushtaq bhai was here till
Day before. - Mushtaq bhai?

128
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:04,118
Mushtaq, Tiger.

129
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:07,723
Tiger Memon. A well known smuggler
with a long record...

130
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,834
Who's Rubina?
- Suleiman bhai's wife

131
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:16,136
Who is Suleiman bhai?
- Suleiman bhai lives here

132
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,142
What does he do?
- I don't know

133
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,644
He's Mushtaq bhai's older
brother... they're all in business.

134
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:22,544
Did they own a Maruti van?

135
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:24,474
They had two three cars.
- Did they file a report?

136
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,142
Report? Can't say... they had several
cars. - Any of them reported missing?

137
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:31,212
I don't know. Mushtaq
bhai was a very busy man.

138
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,124
All kinds of people have been coming
and going the last ten-fifteen days

139
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:38,095
Rubina was saying that they
were going home soon.

140
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:39,791
Where?
- Dubai.

141
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:45,026
Here in Mahim, Dubai's
home for most of us.

142
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:46,731
Break the door.
- What happened?

143
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:47,898
Nothing. Go.

144
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,241
Patil, break the door.

145
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,048
Shinde, open it.

146
00:18:57,116 --> 00:19:00,051
Patil. - Coming sir.
- Take a look inside

147
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:05,015
Check the lockers and shelves

148
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:07,116
Look under the sofa

149
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:20,231
Hathgowda. - Yes sir? - Telephone
diary, check-book. Keep it carefully.

150
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:30,874
What's this?

151
00:20:05,384 --> 00:20:06,715
Didn't I ask for something to eat?

152
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:08,616
I got you some thing sir, but
by then we were all leaving

153
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,592
Did you eat?
- No.

154
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:17,652
There's more. Tell everyone
to get some.

155
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:35,275
Scooter keys

156
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:41,050
Where's that scooter?
- Matunga Police Station

157
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:44,623
Go and try it. See if it fits.

158
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:48,286
There was a manager,
he came by often

159
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:50,622
A manager?
- Yes.

160
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:53,999
What's his name?
Where does he stay?

161
00:20:56,235 --> 00:21:02,174
What happened? Sir, it's time to
break our fast. Do join us.

162
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:19,851
Sir, Dangle sir's back.

163
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:27,256
That telephone diary has some Dubai
and Islamabad numbers... mostly...

164
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,800
Is Maria sir aware?

165
00:21:29,735 --> 00:21:34,399
Yes Dangle? - Sir, It's
the same scooter's key.

166
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:39,734
That manager. What's his name?

167
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:41,746
Asghar Muqadam.
- Look for the rascal.

168
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:43,873
Yes. - Sit straight.

169
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:48,678
How long have you been
working for Tiger?

170
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:50,120
One year

171
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:54,117
What do you know about him?
- I was only his manager sir

172
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:59,255
One year is a long time. Long
enough to learn enough.

173
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,694
I only kept accounts - You just
said you were his manager. - Yes.

174
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:10,399
Look, I haven't eaten
since the morning...

175
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:14,776
My head hurts, I'm hungry.

176
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:18,773
So if you don't cooperate,
I'll have to make you.

177
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:29,926
He smuggled silver and what else?

178
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:40,805
How much do you earn?
- Four thousand.

179
00:22:40,873 --> 00:22:42,738
If I lay my hands on you, you'll
have to spend forty-thousand...

180
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:46,972
...just to fix yourself.

181
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:52,079
What else does Tiger do?
- Hawala

182
00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:56,446
Money laundering?
- Yes

183
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:59,758
In the last year, how many
silver shipments came in?

184
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:03,888
Last year... Six landings.

185
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:07,489
All silver?
- Yes.

186
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:12,031
Where do you people work from?

187
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:15,005
Our office was burnt in the riots.

188
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:17,838
January riots?
- December

189
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,775
If the office was burnt then
where did you work from?

190
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:21,779
We were going to open
another office...

191
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:24,111
...but then there were
the second riots.

192
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:28,785
Now Tiger bhai just calls...

193
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:31,221
...or sends someone. To tell us
when the landing will happen.

194
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:33,485
When do you get informed?

195
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:38,091
Before the landing or after?
- Before.

196
00:23:38,163 --> 00:23:39,858
When was the last landing?

197
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:49,863
Who else did you deal with?
- Ayub and Yakub Memon.

198
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:51,000
And what do they do?

199
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:53,806
Ayub is a Chartered Accountant...

200
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:56,872
Sorry...

201
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:02,810
Ayub lives in Dubai. Yakub is
a Chartered Accountant, here.

202
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:05,847
Tea?

203
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:08,884
You want tea?

204
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:11,322
Okay.

205
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:25,268
Tea.

206
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:37,849
What?
- Nothing

207
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,948
Is it cold?
- No.

208
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:40,081
Not sweet enough?
- No.

209
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,251
Then drink up. - Yes sir.

210
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:58,875
What's wrong?
- You tell me.

211
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:00,606
Nothing.

212
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:05,883
These blasts that happened,
you know anything about them?

213
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:07,942
I swear I don't...

214
00:25:09,221 --> 00:25:13,920
Move back! Move back! - Sit! Sit!

215
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:17,325
You're his father? Make
him understand.

216
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:21,560
He's lying to me!
- Just tell him the truth.

217
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:24,158
I am telling you the truth,
nothing else.

218
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:28,137
Put the old man in a taxi.

219
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:30,434
We'll serve the rest some tea.

220
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:38,575
Come on old man, you have
money for the taxi? Okay, then go.

221
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,949
You all wait. You go home.

222
00:25:42,054 --> 00:25:43,544
Shut the door

223
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,326
Tell me.

224
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:02,132
Tell me quickly.

225
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:04,505
I didn't know what was
going to happen...

226
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:09,005
Everything was in place by the
time I was brought in on it.

227
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:13,507
Start from the beginning
- On February 11...

228
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:16,383
Tiger bhai and Javed
Chikna went to Dubai

229
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:20,357
Who is Javed Chikna?
- Tiger bhai's man

230
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:23,553
Why did they go to Dubai?
- I have no idea.

231
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:24,960
I got a call instructing me...

232
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:29,433
To get half a million from Chauksi
and give it to Dawood Phanse...

233
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:31,434
Who is Chauksi?

234
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,134
Tiger bhai has three Hawala
accounts with him

235
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:40,568
Who else?
- Javed Chikna

236
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,571
You said that already

237
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:46,983
Anwar Theba, Shafi, Abdul Gani...

238
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:49,987
Imtiaz Ghavate, Parvez Sheikh...

239
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:52,616
Parvez Sheikh, Salim...

240
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:56,654
Mohammed Rafique...
Mohammed Hussain...

241
00:26:56,728 --> 00:26:58,389
Salim Rafique Mohammed Hussain?

242
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:00,988
Salim Rafique Madi and
Mohammed Hussain.

243
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:05,230
Sir, I had no idea.

244
00:27:05,304 --> 00:27:12,676
My father was ill.

245
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:17,010
I wanted to leave, get another job.

246
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:21,018
I told Tiger bhai but
he got so angry...

247
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:23,020
...and the terrible
things he said...

248
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:25,216
...he told me to wait for him.

249
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:31,095
Then? Did he come?

250
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:35,463
The first week of the month.
Then he disappeared again.

251
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:37,762
Suddenly I got a call...

252
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:40,769
It was Holi, March 8...

253
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:47,271
He told me to get tickets
done for Dubai...

254
00:27:47,346 --> 00:27:49,041
His father, Ayub bhai,
Yakub bhai...

255
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:51,548
Suleiman bhai... all of them left.

256
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:53,049
A day before the blast
there was a call.

257
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:55,678
They said they want
tickets for Dubai.

258
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:58,181
This is time he asked for a ticket
only for himself.

259
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:00,747
I tried to talk about
quitting my job.

260
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,120
He hadn't paid me since the riots.

261
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:11,659
Tiger bhai, I need to talk
to you... - Ticket's done?

262
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:13,068
Yes of course.

263
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:15,436
Tiger Bhai. I really
need to talk to you.

264
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:16,565
Get my suitcases. Yes.

265
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:22,407
Ramzan has begun and
my father is ill...

266
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:23,812
Get the bags, will you?

267
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:28,553
I have to quit.

268
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:33,080
Just one more day. - One more, one
more, it goes on. Tiger bhai...

269
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,490
...this one more day has
taken a long time.

270
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:35,720
Look there's a lot of work.
I'm going to Dubai.

271
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:37,284
Do something...

272
00:28:38,697 --> 00:28:41,097
Go to Al Hussaini. You'll find
Theba and Chikna there.

273
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:45,694
I've spoken to them. You just have
to drop a car off somewhere.

274
00:28:45,771 --> 00:28:51,334
Do that then you can leave.

275
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:56,504
When I reached there I
couldn't find anybody.

276
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:58,515
I met Sardar, who was
going out for a smoke.

277
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:06,613
There was work going
on in the garage.

278
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:09,855
Maruti vans, scooters,
it was all there.

279
00:29:10,195 --> 00:29:12,129
They were packing some sticky
black paste into the...

280
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:14,631
scooters and the cars.

281
00:29:17,469 --> 00:29:22,133
Hey idiot! That's not bathing soap.
Keep it separately.

282
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:23,504
What is that?

283
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:26,143
RDX, sir. They call
it 'black soap'.

284
00:29:26,211 --> 00:29:30,147
Nails, glass, scrap iron... God
knows what else was put in.

285
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,278
Where's Sardar?
- Somewhere around.

286
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:37,150
Sardar.

287
00:29:37,189 --> 00:29:38,850
He went for a smoke.

288
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:42,319
Don't think he'll be back.

289
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:44,890
Nazir and Parvez?
- They have not come.

290
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:51,665
Lqbal... it's time.

291
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:56,401
Whatever happens,
don't fuck this up.

292
00:29:56,842 --> 00:30:01,245
We're doing this for our brothers.
Go on. Khuda Hafiz.

293
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:10,181
BwTorrents. Com

294
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:13,214
Where do you think you're going?
Get out of there!

295
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:16,260
Are you deaf? Move it! - I want
go there. - Move it!

296
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:18,626
Mohammed lqbal is from my village.

297
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:24,260
I introduced him to Tiger bhai.
He was an electrician.

298
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:27,534
He assembled most of the bombs.

299
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:31,372
Somehow, the scooter he abandoned
at Naigaon didn't explode.

300
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:34,378
Asghar. Come.

301
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:47,314
Here you are. Room 3078.
There are papers in that.

302
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:54,959
Take this. Here, this.
- What? - This.

303
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:57,359
1840.

304
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:59,596
You're booked as Alvani.

305
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:02,469
Listen, don't screw up
and say Advani ok?

306
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:14,309
Press it. - The button is pressed.
- Press it again.

307
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:18,953
This is taking forever.

308
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:21,958
Mushtaq Tarani and Anwer
Theba went to the hotels...

309
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,255
Theba to the Airport Centaur...

310
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:25,523
And Mushtaq to the Juhu Centaur.

311
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:28,332
Theba is from Navpada.

312
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,335
Until three years ago he
worked for Tiger bhai...

313
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:42,403
He brought lmtiaz Ghavate in.
He's a very short-tempered man.

314
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:56,621
Hello Sir.

315
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:05,501
Which floor...?
- Thirty. You mean 3rd floor.

316
00:32:07,572 --> 00:32:08,834
I'll press it sir.

317
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:15,875
Mushtaq is distantly
related to Tiger.

318
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:19,906
He owns a garment store
on the harbour line.

319
00:32:20,385 --> 00:32:22,353
He's a school dropout.

320
00:32:22,454 --> 00:32:24,547
A true Muslim. Prays
five times a day.

321
00:32:25,357 --> 00:32:28,019
He lived near Tiger's office.

322
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:30,326
He planted the bomb
at Juhu Centaur.

323
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:33,592
He then left a wired
scooter at Dhanji Marg.

324
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:46,609
Parvez Sheikh is a druggie.
He dropped out of college.

325
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:50,409
He is Abdul Ghani's elder brother,
Rehman's friend.

326
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:54,350
My sister is married to Abdul
Rehman, Abdul Ghani's brother.

327
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:57,547
Abdul Ghani asked Tiger
to let Parvez join.

328
00:32:57,589 --> 00:33:02,822
He was sent to Sea rock hotel,
and Katha Bazar.

329
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:08,490
Shahnawaz and I left a red Maruti
van at the Plaza cinema.

330
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:11,501
The movie was sold out, so we had
to buy tickets in the black-market.

331
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:17,439
We watched half an hour
of the film and left.

332
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:24,880
Abdul Ghani Turk took the jeep
to the Passport office at Worli.

333
00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:27,383
Back when Tiger was Mohammed
Dossa's driver...

334
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:29,613
...he was just a street vendor.

335
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:34,420
Later when Dossa fled to
Dubai, Tiger took over.

336
00:33:34,492 --> 00:33:40,829
Ghani became his driver, and also
handled Tiger's Hawala business.

337
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:43,697
He left the jeep outside
Passport Office.

338
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:46,729
Bhendi Bazar?
- Hop in.

339
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:57,976
We blow one up here... get the
biggest bastards of them all.

340
00:33:58,049 --> 00:33:59,414
We'll get them. After the
Municipal buildings...

341
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:00,712
Chikna will get them.

342
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:03,420
Tainur and Irfan Chougle
left a blue Maruti car...

343
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:06,947
...outside the Stock Exchange.

344
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:15,498
Farooq Pawle is from
a well to do family.

345
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:21,972
He's a high flyer, you often
see him at the Taj hotel.

346
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:35,519
He left the white Ambassador
car at the Air India Building.

347
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:39,787
And then accompanied Badshah to
the Shiv Sena Bhavan, in Dadar.

348
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:42,790
Badshah Khan almost didn't
show up that morning.

349
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:45,462
A real estate broker
from Vile Parle...

350
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,192
...he lost his business
in the riots.

351
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:53,602
You know what time it is?
- I just dozed off...

352
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:55,730
You know what time it is?
- I just dozed off...

353
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:57,900
Of all the days, today?
- I know...

354
00:34:57,976 --> 00:35:00,945
it's late but...
- What do you mean?

355
00:35:01,012 --> 00:35:03,879
Everyone's gone already?
- No, you were the chief guest.

356
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:05,882
Get your ass into the car.

357
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,076
Loaded?

358
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:10,715
Right outside their
fortress.

359
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:12,518
So much for the might
of the Marathas!

360
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:21,697
Hey this chimp is standing here.
- Hey stop!

361
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:26,867
You can't park here.
- It belongs to the HQ.

362
00:35:26,938 --> 00:35:28,838
I'm the boss' man

363
00:35:28,907 --> 00:35:31,171
The boss himself won't park here.

364
00:35:31,242 --> 00:35:34,075
Don't you understand
what I am saying?

365
00:35:34,145 --> 00:35:36,045
Farooq! - You do what you want.
I will park here.

366
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:37,979
Go ahead and book me asshole.

367
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:43,544
Hey come inside. - He's talking
about a ticket. - Come in.

368
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:48,115
Go ahead and park.

369
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,864
How can I help you?

370
00:35:59,604 --> 00:36:01,595
We're fine.
- You want to service the car?

371
00:36:01,673 --> 00:36:02,731
No.

372
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:06,170
Then please don't park it here.

373
00:36:06,611 --> 00:36:09,079
We'll take a minute. - Sir, my
boss will kill me. Please...

374
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:10,205
Hey, who is your boss?

375
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:14,608
Farooq, come on. - Who is your boss?

376
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,956
We'll leave it outside
Mohammed Ali's

377
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:23,892
But our people live there.

378
00:36:23,962 --> 00:36:26,157
It's right next to Sena Bhavan.

379
00:36:26,965 --> 00:36:31,698
Do one thing. Get down.
- Okay. - Get a taxi.

380
00:37:03,201 --> 00:37:06,602
Mushtaq, you and lmtiaz go...
Zaveri Bazaar, Dhanji Marg...

381
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:12,075
leave it at the mouth
of the lane. - Okay. - Go.

382
00:37:13,678 --> 00:37:18,172
Imtiaz Ghavate, a close friend of
Theba's, was also from Navpada.

383
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:20,617
They are neighbours.

384
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:24,018
Why so much traffic here?
Has something happened?

385
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:26,649
Can't you see? There's a jam ahead.

386
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:28,624
They're saying that there was a
bomb blast at the Stock Exchange

387
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:32,686
Cut through the traffic.
There's no time.

388
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:05,390
Time up.

389
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:14,729
You want to go see it? Sena
Bhavan... all the flying pieces...

390
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:16,671
That's not funny.

391
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:25,681
Tainur, Pawle, Bashir and Abdul
Akhar Yakub were sent to...

392
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,378
...the Macchimar colony at Mahim.

393
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:32,719
They were ordered to hurl grenades
amidst the resident houses.

394
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,692
During the riots all the timber
markets at Mahim were burnt...

395
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:42,427
...where Tiger used
to have a huge stake.

396
00:39:00,385 --> 00:39:03,843
Chikna, Badshah and
Sheikh Ali left last.

397
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:06,724
As they drove past the Passport
Office, Chikna noticed...

398
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:08,749
...that one of the detonators
was blinking.

399
00:39:09,794 --> 00:39:11,728
Mushtaq, stop the car.

400
00:39:12,797 --> 00:39:13,889
Stop the car.

401
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:24,036
Badshah. What is it?
- Why is it blinking?

402
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:26,868
No idea.

403
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:28,002
What do we do?
- How do I know?

404
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,107
Throw it! Throw it! Throw it!
Fast! Throw it!

405
00:39:39,357 --> 00:39:42,986
Somehow at that very moment the
Passport office bomb exploded too.

406
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:47,430
And they got trapped in the chaos.
Chikna was shit scared.

407
00:39:47,832 --> 00:39:51,165
He cancelled the rest of
the plan, then and there.

408
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:55,771
Mushtaq, ditch the car somewhere.

409
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:04,405
Mushtaq left the car outside
the Siemens factory.

410
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:08,775
In the night all the boys
met at Theba's place...

411
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:11,219
...to hear the blast news on TV.

412
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,790
According to latest reports there
have been twelve bomb blasts...

413
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:17,795
...in quick succession in different
parts of the city...

414
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:20,797
...Stock Exchange, Zaveri bazaar,
the Air India building...

415
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:23,800
...Macchimar colony, Hotel Juhu
Centaur, Hotel Sea Rock...

416
00:40:23,868 --> 00:40:27,167
...Plaza Cinema, and
Lucky Petrol Pump.

417
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:29,399
Who had gone there? - Shut up fool.

418
00:40:29,474 --> 00:40:32,272
I had planted it.
But if it didn't explode...

419
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:33,867
You... - Shut up! Listen!

420
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:36,436
Relief work is on in full swing.

421
00:40:36,514 --> 00:40:40,006
Chief Minister Mr. Sharad Pawar has
gone on record to say that...

422
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:42,814
Why did you put it off? Let us see.
- Shut up.

423
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:45,823
Whoever can get out of Bombay,
overnight, should get out.

424
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:50,817
...Tiger bhai's orders, none of you
should be seen in the city.

425
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:52,886
Go into hiding.

426
00:40:53,898 --> 00:40:57,834
Stay in touch with Tiger bhai.
You have the Dubai number?

427
00:40:57,902 --> 00:41:01,565
Stay in touch. Okay?
Come on get lost.

428
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:18,855
Sir. Your progress so far
has been commendable.

429
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:31,526
All we know is that Tiger Memon
planned and executed the blasts.

430
00:41:32,937 --> 00:41:34,199
He has fled.

431
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:42,477
There was not much at his house.
His properties have been sealed.

432
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:47,884
We have the names of those who were
involved in the conspiracy with him.

433
00:41:47,952 --> 00:41:51,911
But they won't be waiting
for us at their homes.

434
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:54,890
So here's what we do...

435
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:56,894
Most of them are from Navpada,
Behrampada and Dongri...

436
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:59,896
the places worst hit by
the communal riots.

437
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:07,598
Pick up everyone we grilled
during the riots.

438
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:09,470
Tap your informers.

439
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:15,139
Find out where these fellows eat,
sleep, walk, talk... everything.

440
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,971
Put together a list, give
it to your informers.

441
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:23,954
No one goes home till
we've got these people.

442
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:28,949
It's the holy month of Ramadan.
So be careful

443
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:32,518
Whatever you do, make sure you
don't hurt their religious sentiments

444
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:35,590
Dangle you'll handle this location.

445
00:42:36,534 --> 00:42:39,435
Vani, Nadgouda and you,
form your team.

446
00:42:39,503 --> 00:42:41,300
Tap everybody you know.

447
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,604
Be ruthless, be aggressive,
but be tactful.

448
00:42:47,011 --> 00:42:50,208
Do whatever is necessary.

449
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:52,175
Sarfaraz!

450
00:42:53,284 --> 00:42:54,546
Get down here.

451
00:42:56,554 --> 00:43:00,991
See these names? You
know any of them?

452
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,386
One or two. But not that well.
- Okay, sir.

453
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:08,523
Think about it. Keep your eyes
and ears open. - Okay, sir.

454
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:10,692
Let me know if you get something.
- Okay, sir.

455
00:43:16,574 --> 00:43:20,032
Who is it? Where is Parvez?
- He must be in the loo.

456
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:29,450
Parvez? Come on out.

457
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:34,082
Go to the next one.

458
00:43:34,191 --> 00:43:37,388
It's occupied. Come on I can't
hold it much longer.

459
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:41,727
Can't a man crap in peace?

460
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:43,125
Get out of there!

461
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,003
What the hell...? Come on,
to the police station.

462
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:49,596
My boss wants to see you.

463
00:43:53,077 --> 00:43:57,013
Open the door. What's the
point in hiding now?

464
00:43:57,081 --> 00:44:02,075
I'm telling you. We
break the damn door.

465
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,453
Parvez whenever, you open the door,
you'll find us.

466
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:09,354
Go and come through the door.

467
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:12,396
Are you a monkey that you are
coming through the window?

468
00:44:45,129 --> 00:44:50,066
Sir, you'll find Shoaib Ghansari in
the slums behind Sahara Airport.

469
00:44:55,673 --> 00:44:58,073
Listen where's Shoaib Ghansari?

470
00:44:58,142 --> 00:44:59,734
Do you know Shoaib Ghansari?

471
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:04,440
Are you deaf? We're talking to you.

472
00:45:04,515 --> 00:45:09,817
Hey who will put water? You are
always asleep. No work. You just eat.

473
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:13,084
Hey Shoaib... - Wait there! Wait!

474
00:45:13,124 --> 00:45:18,426
Where are you going? Come on!

475
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:23,497
Come on.

476
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,838
Come here.

477
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:42,646
Mother! Mother!

478
00:45:43,654 --> 00:45:46,248
What's your name?

479
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:55,190
Help me! Help me!

480
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,193
Leave us sir. We haven't done
anything sir.

481
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:03,206
Why are these people here?
Clear them out. - Come please.

482
00:46:03,274 --> 00:46:07,608
Clear them. Take them away.

483
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:25,757
One day...

484
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,161
we were playing cricket...

485
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:31,668
and our ball smashed Tiger
uncle's windscreen.

486
00:46:31,735 --> 00:46:35,899
He came over and whacked
Bablu really hard.

487
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,836
We don't play cricket anymore
if we see his car parked here.

488
00:46:40,911 --> 00:46:43,243
He gets so angry!

489
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:57,183
Where is lmtiaz Ghavate?

490
00:46:57,261 --> 00:47:00,788
I told you! I know nothing.

491
00:47:01,866 --> 00:47:03,697
I really know nothing.

492
00:47:03,767 --> 00:47:07,430
Mushtaq Tarani is still in Bombay.

493
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:10,702
Some of the others went to Dubai,
some to Rajasthan.

494
00:47:11,275 --> 00:47:13,607
You can pick him up tomorrow.

495
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,874
Hey you, hang on a minute!

496
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:24,720
Catch him!

497
00:47:25,823 --> 00:47:28,621
If he's innocent you have
nothing to worry about.

498
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:31,753
He might even be home right now.

499
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:38,291
No sir. I've been back and forth for
three days, you keep saying that.

500
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:40,837
What more can I do? What?

501
00:47:40,905 --> 00:47:43,601
If he's innocent he'll be let off.

502
00:47:44,842 --> 00:47:47,811
Look, this doesn't have to end
With your neck in a noose.

503
00:47:56,587 --> 00:47:57,679
I don't know.

504
00:48:08,832 --> 00:48:11,995
Where does lmtiaz Ghavate live?

505
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:14,503
Sir I don't know. Go ask over there

506
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:16,601
You look there.

507
00:48:20,611 --> 00:48:21,942
Add it to my account

508
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:26,346
Hi Sharief. - Imtiaz. - Imtiaz
Ghavate stays here? - There he is.

509
00:48:27,351 --> 00:48:28,784
Where's lmtiaz Ghavate?

510
00:48:29,353 --> 00:48:30,411
I don't know

511
00:48:30,487 --> 00:48:32,011
We've got him

512
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:34,582
Vani, grab him!

513
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:40,626
Start the car. Come on fast.
Move the car.

514
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:41,652
No sign of him here. Will
check the station.

515
00:50:15,993 --> 00:50:19,622
Water. Tea.

516
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:41,611
Get in you filthy animal. Come on,
get behind. Hey Nahadi sit ahead.

517
00:51:46,884 --> 00:51:50,513
Nahadi? Where are you? Found him?

518
00:51:50,621 --> 00:51:57,618
It's Nahadi. He's right in
front of me. On the pipeline.

519
00:51:59,563 --> 00:52:00,894
Keep him there. I am coming.

520
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:06,695
Sir... - Don't move from there,
we're reaching there.

521
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:14,503
Wait lmtiaz...

522
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:17,570
Wait lmtiaz...

523
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:48,004
Wait lmtiaz... don't move,
or I'll shoot.

524
00:52:56,620 --> 00:53:05,028
Imtiaz, wait.

525
00:53:07,898 --> 00:53:09,297
Wait!

526
00:53:22,145 --> 00:53:23,578
Wait lmtiaz...

527
00:53:25,082 --> 00:53:28,574
Wait lmtiaz...

528
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,720
Where did he go?

529
00:54:29,246 --> 00:54:30,907
You didn't do anything?

530
00:54:33,717 --> 00:54:35,048
Get me the hammer.

531
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,350
Hold him down. Hold him down.

532
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,654
Come on speak up.

533
00:54:45,729 --> 00:54:47,390
Speak up!

534
00:54:48,732 --> 00:54:50,666
You did nothing?

535
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:52,395
Nothing?

536
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:56,239
Nothing?

537
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,833
You did nothing?

538
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:06,281
Tell us. Tell us. You did nothing?

539
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:14,280
Stand straight.
- Straight!

540
00:55:22,899 --> 00:55:25,868
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

541
00:55:27,204 --> 00:55:28,432
Sign on the paper

542
00:55:29,439 --> 00:55:33,432
Sign here! Hold the pen upright

543
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:41,312
I will make sure you sign!

544
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:47,747
Stand straight.

545
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:54,320
Give me your finger print!
It pains or what?

546
00:56:01,805 --> 00:56:02,863
Take him away.

547
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:07,933
Come on move, you nut! Come on get
up or I'll break the other leg too.

548
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:09,945
Come on. Yes.

549
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:11,742
Remove the red.

550
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:15,410
Badshah Khan and Bashir
Khan are together.

551
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:18,977
Badshah is from Rampur and
Bashir is from Gorakhpur.

552
00:56:19,056 --> 00:56:21,388
You'll find them in
one of these places.

553
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,779
Bashir...
- What happened?

554
00:56:44,848 --> 00:56:46,941
That cop's looking at us.

555
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:49,784
Maybe he just looks like that.

556
00:56:49,853 --> 00:56:50,911
Let's go.

557
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:55,986
What happened?
- Let's call Tiger.

558
00:56:57,994 --> 00:56:59,791
The cop's gone.

559
00:57:04,968 --> 00:57:06,401
We should still call Tiger.

560
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:10,463
What the hell are you doing in
Delhi? What were my instructions?

561
00:57:10,874 --> 00:57:14,810
I told you people to
go underground...

562
00:57:14,878 --> 00:57:18,143
and you're bloody sightseeing
in the capital!

563
00:57:19,382 --> 00:57:21,213
You think Delhi's any
safer than Bombay?

564
00:57:21,885 --> 00:57:25,946
Before the police catches you,
get out of there.

565
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:31,385
Wherever you go next, call me.

566
00:57:31,895 --> 00:57:35,160
Why does Asghar talk like this?
- Even I was angry.

567
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:39,893
Where do we go now?

568
00:57:44,841 --> 00:57:46,138
To my village.

569
00:58:04,194 --> 00:58:07,595
Come.

570
00:58:11,368 --> 00:58:13,359
Greetings uncle. - Greetings.

571
00:58:13,937 --> 00:58:16,872
How are you?
- All well.

572
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,467
And your mother?
- Very well.

573
00:58:21,378 --> 00:58:25,109
Why the decorations?
- Sultana's wedding.

574
00:58:25,182 --> 00:58:26,479
Really?

575
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:28,884
This is my friend Bashir.

576
00:58:28,952 --> 00:58:32,410
Make yourselves at home. - Come.

577
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:40,555
If you sit around here who's
going to get me tea?

578
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:53,904
BwTorrents. Com

579
00:58:55,245 --> 00:58:56,644
Where are you?

580
00:58:56,713 --> 00:58:58,977
You said you'd be gone for two days.

581
00:58:59,983 --> 00:59:01,041
I'm in Rampur.

582
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:02,345
What are you doing there?

583
00:59:03,587 --> 00:59:05,316
Sultana's getting married.

584
00:59:05,355 --> 00:59:06,913
You remembered?

585
00:59:06,957 --> 00:59:08,015
Obviously.

586
00:59:08,124 --> 00:59:10,024
Wasik will join you.

587
00:59:10,994 --> 00:59:13,485
Know what? Shahnawaz
keeps coming round.

588
00:59:13,563 --> 00:59:14,928
Asking for you.

589
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:18,666
For what?

590
00:59:18,735 --> 00:59:21,602
I don't know.
- What does he want from me?

591
00:59:21,938 --> 00:59:23,132
Any message for him?

592
00:59:23,206 --> 00:59:25,606
Send him along with Wasik.

593
00:59:26,009 --> 00:59:28,443
What's he going to do there?
- Just send him.

594
00:59:29,346 --> 00:59:32,008
I'll hang up now. It's long
distance. I'll call you back.

595
00:59:34,351 --> 00:59:35,545
What happened?

596
00:59:37,988 --> 00:59:39,683
Shahnawaz is looking for me.

597
00:59:40,557 --> 00:59:43,958
I heard that in Bombay
some 5000 Hindus...

598
00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:46,689
were killed in bomb blasts.

599
00:59:47,364 --> 00:59:50,094
Around 300.

600
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:56,435
The count hardly matters. Spilling
blood isn't right.

601
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:01,033
Where are you? Rampur?

602
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:02,476
Yes, bhai.

603
01:00:03,046 --> 01:00:07,039
Okay, get to Jaipur.

604
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:10,046
I'll bring you to Dubai from there.

605
01:00:15,492 --> 01:00:19,519
Go to Tonk. To my friend
Salim Durani's place.

606
01:00:20,063 --> 01:00:23,521
I've spoken to him. Theba, Yeda,
everyone is there.

607
01:01:04,441 --> 01:01:05,772
Things are still hot in Bombay.

608
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,601
Imtiaz Ghavate, Asgar Muqadam...
they've all been caught.

609
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:13,046
The cops know about us.
They're hunting for us.

610
01:01:14,584 --> 01:01:16,176
Tiger bhai called.

611
01:01:18,088 --> 01:01:20,056
We need to get out of
here. Go to Jaipur.

612
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:22,650
But we've just come from there.
- Don't argue.

613
01:01:23,093 --> 01:01:26,722
What's going on? Back and
forth, back and forth

614
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:30,122
You're arguing with me?
- We were better off in Rampur.

615
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,065
You're arguing with me?

616
01:01:32,135 --> 01:01:35,764
What's this shit? - Easy, Badshah.
- You're arguing with me?

617
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,669
Shut up!

618
01:02:05,168 --> 01:02:06,362
Let's go

619
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:27,451
Who says this is the Pink City?
Everything's red here.

620
01:02:27,524 --> 01:02:31,119
Who are they trying to fool?
- Anwer bhai...

621
01:02:31,628 --> 01:02:33,493
when are we going to Dubai?

622
01:02:36,733 --> 01:02:37,859
What's so funny?

623
01:02:39,702 --> 01:02:42,136
No one's going to Dubai.
- Tiger bhai had promised...

624
01:02:42,205 --> 01:02:44,765
he'd get us to Dubai.
- He had promised all of us.

625
01:02:46,743 --> 01:02:50,406
He asked me to give you 10,000 each.
- I want to go to Dubai. Got it?

626
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,416
Without a passport?
- Answer has them.

627
01:02:55,752 --> 01:02:58,380
You have our passports, right?

628
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:02,184
I don't have anything.

629
01:03:03,193 --> 01:03:07,152
No? Why? You kept all
the passport...

630
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:09,164
. asshole after we
returned from Islamabad

631
01:03:09,232 --> 01:03:11,564
Badshah! Don't you abuse me!
- Where are the passports?

632
01:03:11,634 --> 01:03:13,761
Watch your tongue!
- Why the fuck?

633
01:03:13,837 --> 01:03:15,702
You had all the passports.
- Behave yourself!

634
01:03:15,772 --> 01:03:19,799
Behave yourself.
- Where is my passport?

635
01:03:20,243 --> 01:03:22,177
It's with Tiger bhai.
- They were all burnt.

636
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:23,303
What?

637
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:25,340
Passports

638
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:28,478
Burnt them?

639
01:03:29,853 --> 01:03:31,912
My passport was burnt...?
- All our passports.

640
01:03:34,224 --> 01:03:39,252
How could you do that?
- Tiger bhai did it.

641
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:41,797
Burnt my passport! And
I wasn't even told.

642
01:03:41,865 --> 01:03:44,390
It was Tiger bhai's idea. You
have a problem, talk to me.

643
01:03:44,467 --> 01:03:46,867
How could you burn my passport?
- Tiger bhai did it.

644
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:49,397
Why would he do it?
- Behave yourself.

645
01:03:49,472 --> 01:03:52,930
He's made other arrangements.
- Arrangements, my foot!

646
01:03:53,009 --> 01:03:56,206
You're fooling with us.
- Again! Watch it!

647
01:03:56,279 --> 01:03:58,213
You won't abuse me, Badshah.

648
01:03:58,281 --> 01:04:03,776
They told me go to Jaipur...

649
01:04:03,853 --> 01:04:07,254
They told me to go to Jaipur.
I came to Jaipur...

650
01:04:07,357 --> 01:04:10,224
...they are telling me to go there.
To hell with you, rascal.

651
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,228
They are fooling me.

652
01:04:12,295 --> 01:04:15,628
Coming here to Jaipur, he says...

653
01:04:15,698 --> 01:04:16,824
Look Badshah...

654
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:22,839
You get out of here Badshah!
- To hell with you.

655
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:26,366
Rascal!

656
01:04:50,867 --> 01:04:53,836
Enough. Everything
will be all right.

657
01:04:55,672 --> 01:04:58,971
Look Badshah.

658
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:04,541
I'm sure Tiger bhai knows
what he's doing.

659
01:05:05,882 --> 01:05:09,283
He's probably got some plan to get
us across the border.

660
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:11,582
That's hwy he sent
us to Rajasthan.

661
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:19,489
Theba was saying that new passports
are waiting for us in Pakistan.

662
01:05:20,897 --> 01:05:22,592
Just calm down.

663
01:05:34,377 --> 01:05:35,503
Look Badshah...

664
01:05:36,913 --> 01:05:38,676
forgive me if I'm at fault.

665
01:05:41,384 --> 01:05:42,976
I'm just following Tiger
bhai's orders.

666
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:49,951
We are all as worried as you are.

667
01:05:52,996 --> 01:05:55,055
Tiger wouldn't abandon us.

668
01:05:58,935 --> 01:06:03,395
You have no idea how much
Tiger bhai feels for you.

669
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:17,342
Look. Relax. Don't get so emotional.
Remember, you are one of us.

670
01:06:31,968 --> 01:06:37,565
It's too dangerous for all
of us to stay together.

671
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:41,041
Why? - There's danger.

672
01:06:44,447 --> 01:06:45,880
So then what's to be done?

673
01:06:45,948 --> 01:06:50,112
We split up. But stay in
touch with Tiger bhai.

674
01:06:54,424 --> 01:06:55,516
What next?

675
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:05,866
Another man came looking for you.

676
01:07:05,935 --> 01:07:08,460
Who? What did he want?

677
01:07:08,538 --> 01:07:12,804
He asked why you'd
shut shop and left.

678
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:14,809
I hope you are all right?

679
01:07:14,877 --> 01:07:15,935
Who was he?

680
01:07:16,479 --> 01:07:17,810
I didn't ask.

681
01:07:19,015 --> 01:07:21,006
He behaved very strangely.

682
01:07:21,484 --> 01:07:24,817
He walked right into Wasik's room.

683
01:07:24,854 --> 01:07:28,051
Opened all the cupboards, turned
everything upside down.

684
01:07:28,424 --> 01:07:32,485
That thug even stepped
on our food mat!

685
01:07:32,562 --> 01:07:37,022
If he comes back, don't
say you spoke to me.

686
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,159
Are you into...?
- Say nothing!

687
01:07:40,503 --> 01:07:41,993
Bye.

688
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:48,568
The police came to my house.

689
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:58,780
You spoke to Tiger?
- They're trying to connect me.

690
01:07:58,855 --> 01:08:01,688
Sir, I'm not getting through.
- No?

691
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:06,519
Come on.

692
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:09,588
The guys might've made
it to Pakistan.

693
01:08:11,868 --> 01:08:14,132
We should try Anwar then.
- Where?

694
01:08:15,004 --> 01:08:19,065
There's no one left. We don't
Know where anyone is.

695
01:08:19,142 --> 01:08:23,135
We can't get through to Tiger.
My mother's going hysterical.

696
01:08:25,882 --> 01:08:29,545
I can't stay under such stress.

697
01:08:29,619 --> 01:08:31,484
You think too much.

698
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:37,483
What else can I do? What?

699
01:08:37,527 --> 01:08:39,552
You know the scene in Bombay.

700
01:08:39,629 --> 01:08:41,756
And we've run out of ideas.

701
01:08:41,831 --> 01:08:44,231
Just go to sleep.
- I wonder...

702
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:50,735
if I should just give myself up.

703
01:09:16,132 --> 01:09:18,794
Have you seen Bashir?
- He went out.

704
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:28,668
Bashir

705
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:35,676
Bashir

706
01:09:41,157 --> 01:09:43,250
Uncle, have you seen Bashir?

707
01:09:43,593 --> 01:09:46,084
He went off this morning.
He left a note for you.

708
01:09:50,633 --> 01:09:52,191
I am going to Gorakhpur.

709
01:09:52,797 --> 01:09:54,890
Call Tiger bhai at this new number.

710
01:09:56,334 --> 01:09:58,393
I took some money.

711
01:10:23,294 --> 01:10:25,353
Greetings. - Greetings.

712
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,421
I need a room.
- Name?

713
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:31,768
Nasir Khan.
- From?

714
01:10:31,836 --> 01:10:35,169
Jaipur. Where can I make
a long distance call?

715
01:10:35,239 --> 01:10:36,297
Across the street.

716
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:40,835
Tiger bhai, I'm in Delhi.
Outside the Jama Masjid.

717
01:10:40,912 --> 01:10:47,112
As you had told me.
What now, Tiger bhai?

718
01:10:47,185 --> 01:10:48,812
I'll send you some money.

719
01:10:48,886 --> 01:10:51,514
The moment you get it,
leave for Calcutta.

720
01:11:03,868 --> 01:11:05,927
Did anyone...

721
01:11:06,003 --> 01:11:12,135
...ask for me? - No one. For
Nasir Khan or Badshah Khan?

722
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:14,804
No.
- No calls either?

723
01:11:21,419 --> 01:11:29,554
"It became a garland..."
- Badshah Khan.

724
01:11:32,897 --> 01:11:39,427
What is it? - It is for you?

725
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:41,028
Tiger bhai has sent it.

726
01:11:41,105 --> 01:11:44,074
I told him I'm staying
here as Nasir Khan.

727
01:11:44,142 --> 01:11:45,837
I'll leave. Good bye.

728
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:51,473
"I put my life in trouble..."

729
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:12,867
Lord!

730
01:12:12,937 --> 01:12:16,873
Lord!

731
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:19,375
Yes.

732
01:12:19,443 --> 01:12:25,109
I'm at the Natraj Hotel.
Outside Howrah Station, bhai.

733
01:12:31,956 --> 01:12:36,188
A man will come for you...
Go with him.

734
01:13:03,321 --> 01:13:10,659
"I thought the war's
color was golden..."

735
01:13:13,531 --> 01:13:21,495
"I thought the war's
color was golden..."

736
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:40,621
"But later I understood it later..."

737
01:13:51,435 --> 01:13:58,568
"I thought the war's
color was golden..."

738
01:13:59,043 --> 01:14:02,035
"I thought the war's
color was golden.

739
01:14:02,113 --> 01:14:04,013
But later I understood it later..."

740
01:14:04,115 --> 01:14:09,610
"It was black...

741
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:20,722
It's been four days and
no one's turned up.

742
01:14:24,268 --> 01:14:28,500
I can't get through
to Tiger bhai.

743
01:14:32,076 --> 01:14:35,011
What am I supposed to do now?
I'm running out of money.

744
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,209
I can't take it anymore!

745
01:14:42,053 --> 01:14:47,184
"Oh Ali..."

746
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,225
Yes, what do you want?

747
01:14:58,302 --> 01:15:00,497
A room. Cheap.
- Single, Double?

748
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:05,205
Even if there's no bed it'll do.
But cheap. Understand? Cheap.

749
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:34,627
Badshah Khan?

750
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:45,300
Uncuff him.

751
01:17:13,771 --> 01:17:15,295
Were you in Bombay on March 12?

752
01:17:22,246 --> 01:17:23,907
Where was the plan made?

753
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:34,182
You realise how many people
died that day...

754
01:17:34,258 --> 01:17:36,249
how much the city suffered?

755
01:17:38,262 --> 01:17:41,595
Oh but it's a big world, and for you
there are plenty of places to hide.

756
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,325
I didn't do anything
- Shut up!

757
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,425
Don't you dare lie to me.

758
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:49,665
See that file there?

759
01:17:51,275 --> 01:17:55,211
It has all their statements...

760
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:59,215
...lmtiaz Ghavate, Asgar Muqadam,

761
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:01,411
Shoaib, Mushtaq...

762
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,551
So who begins? You? Or me?

763
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:08,952
You? Or me?

764
01:18:12,296 --> 01:18:14,730
I worked for Tiger bhai...
- No one's a bhai here!

765
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:17,300
Give me his fucking name!

766
01:18:18,435 --> 01:18:19,732
Tiger Memon.

767
01:18:24,842 --> 01:18:26,707
They destroyed the Babri Masjid...

768
01:18:28,312 --> 01:18:30,371
slaughtered us Muslims...

769
01:18:35,853 --> 01:18:37,684
raped our women...

770
01:18:38,322 --> 01:18:42,258
it was inevitable, someone
needed to avenge us...

771
01:18:42,326 --> 01:18:47,263
That person was Tiger. He made a
plan, he brought us together...

772
01:18:47,331 --> 01:18:51,324
we all wanted revenge, it was jihad.

773
01:18:52,803 --> 01:18:54,270
Had we not carried out the blasts...

774
01:18:54,338 --> 01:18:56,272
life would've become miserable
for Muslims in this country.

775
01:18:57,775 --> 01:18:59,333
The Babri Masjid wasn't
made of straw.

776
01:19:01,345 --> 01:19:03,279
They said "No bulldozers,
no bombs...

777
01:19:03,347 --> 01:19:04,405
...we tore it down with
our bare hands".

778
01:19:04,481 --> 01:19:05,505
You might believe that. I don't.

779
01:19:07,318 --> 01:19:08,717
And then you beat us up.

780
01:19:10,321 --> 01:19:12,346
Burnt us alive on the streets?

781
01:19:15,893 --> 01:19:17,861
Murder our children?

782
01:19:20,364 --> 01:19:21,797
Where was the plan made?

783
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,596
I don't know.

784
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:27,701
Who made this plan? Whose
money was behind it?

785
01:19:29,373 --> 01:19:31,637
Who were the people involved?
- I did it! All by myself!

786
01:19:31,709 --> 01:19:32,903
Shoot me.

787
01:19:34,378 --> 01:19:36,812
I didn't do it for money.
Allah was with us.

788
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:41,908
That's why we won this Holy war.
We had His blessings.

789
01:19:44,922 --> 01:19:46,446
Actually, this time Allah
was on our side.

790
01:19:49,393 --> 01:19:50,655
You are joking sir...

791
01:19:53,397 --> 01:19:58,664
Look at how many we killed.
We got our revenge.

792
01:19:58,736 --> 01:19:59,930
That's bull shit.

793
01:20:01,739 --> 01:20:03,604
Allah would never harm the innocent.

794
01:20:05,409 --> 01:20:07,343
Every true man has
Allah on his side.

795
01:20:07,411 --> 01:20:09,402
We all have the same God.

796
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:11,473
Who doesn't see us as different.

797
01:20:12,983 --> 01:20:15,042
But idiots like you do.

798
01:20:17,921 --> 01:20:19,889
This time Allah was with us.

799
01:20:21,558 --> 01:20:24,618
Allah was with us, that's why you
had to abandon that Maruti van.

800
01:20:25,963 --> 01:20:29,421
That's why we made 200 arrests
within two months.

801
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:33,027
Had Allah been with you, you
wouldn't be here right now.

802
01:20:34,972 --> 01:20:36,530
And we would have no evidence.

803
01:20:39,777 --> 01:20:41,574
On your side was Tiger Memon.

804
01:20:41,645 --> 01:20:43,510
He saw your rage and
manipulated you.

805
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:47,877
He was gone before the first
bomb was even planted.

806
01:20:47,918 --> 01:20:50,079
He took his family, and
left you behind...

807
01:20:51,455 --> 01:20:54,390
so that you could be caught
and beaten like this.

808
01:20:59,997 --> 01:21:03,398
He fucked you over. Know why?

809
01:21:07,137 --> 01:21:09,469
Because you were begging for it.

810
01:21:11,942 --> 01:21:14,137
All in the name of religion.

811
01:21:14,478 --> 01:21:15,809
You're a fucking idiot...

812
01:21:17,014 --> 01:21:21,110
and so is every Hindu,
who murders one of you.

813
01:21:21,452 --> 01:21:23,420
Everyone who has nothing
better to do...

814
01:21:23,454 --> 01:21:25,422
but fight in the name of religion
is a fucking idiot.

815
01:21:29,026 --> 01:21:30,425
Because of bastards like you,
along the way...

816
01:21:30,494 --> 01:21:32,826
...we also crush innocent lives.

817
01:21:33,497 --> 01:21:36,432
We work ourselves to madness night
after night... We.

818
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,491
We, rascal!

819
01:21:48,512 --> 01:21:49,638
Get him out of here.

820
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,394
There is a man. - Yakub Khan.

821
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:06,588
He was involved, too.

822
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:09,865
Yakub Khan?
- They call him Yeda Yakub.

823
01:22:09,933 --> 01:22:12,561
Majid Khan owns M.K. Builders.
Yakub is his brother.

824
01:22:22,279 --> 01:22:23,610
Where did Yeda plant a bomb?

825
01:22:23,947 --> 01:22:26,415
I don't know, but he
put in a lot of money.

826
01:22:28,285 --> 01:22:31,118
He had all the RDX
smuggled into Bombay.

827
01:22:31,188 --> 01:22:33,156
He's close to Tiger and Dawood.

828
01:22:33,557 --> 01:22:35,957
You know the gangster Piloo Khan?
- Piloo Khan?

829
01:22:36,026 --> 01:22:38,153
The guy in the shootout
at National College?

830
01:22:38,228 --> 01:22:40,628
He deals in cocaine.

831
01:22:41,298 --> 01:22:43,892
He and Yeda were at loggerheads.

832
01:22:43,967 --> 01:22:48,233
Dawood tried to settle it, but
there are still problems, I hear.

833
01:22:49,973 --> 01:22:52,373
Piloo Khan was in it too?
- He knew about it, yeah.

834
01:22:52,976 --> 01:22:54,375
Stop it at the side.

835
01:22:55,446 --> 01:22:57,243
The cops are looking for you.

836
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:01,349
Did they come here?

837
01:23:01,952 --> 01:23:03,317
Not here.

838
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:09,992
Did you have anything
to do with this?

839
01:23:11,462 --> 01:23:13,657
Am I mad?
- So why are they looking for you?

840
01:23:13,997 --> 01:23:15,487
Don't they, always?

841
01:23:15,999 --> 01:23:18,934
Go to the police station.
Tell them...

842
01:23:19,002 --> 01:23:21,527
you were out of town.
- Why?

843
01:23:22,005 --> 01:23:25,600
I really wasn't here on March 12.
- All right, but go anyway.

844
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:30,069
What is the stuff you stashed
in the warehouse?

845
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:33,345
Your brother is in construction,
right?

846
01:23:33,984 --> 01:23:36,384
He owns M. K Builders.

847
01:23:38,121 --> 01:23:41,352
How many buildings are being made?
- Why? Wanna buy an apartment?

848
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:50,432
We need a place to hide some soap.

849
01:23:51,034 --> 01:23:52,501
Soap?

850
01:23:58,141 --> 01:23:59,335
Black soap.

851
01:24:00,377 --> 01:24:01,969
I'm moving the soap.

852
01:24:02,045 --> 01:24:03,171
Why?

853
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:05,715
I don't want to involve my brother.
- Where will you take it?

854
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:10,009
Some to Shahid's warehouse in
Mumbra, and some to Jindran.

855
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:11,520
This stuff have a name?

856
01:24:12,055 --> 01:24:15,650
It's just stuff. I haven't
christened it as yet.

857
01:24:15,726 --> 01:24:19,685
Don't you trust me?
- Damn trust. I need to know.

858
01:24:31,341 --> 01:24:32,706
It's not a bomb.

859
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:39,412
The warehouse won't blow up. Okay.

860
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:43,247
I just need to use it for a while.
I'll move the goods soon.

861
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:47,086
You owe me for this. Anyone
asks, I know nothing.

862
01:24:54,364 --> 01:24:55,763
Seal it off.

863
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:00,227
It's really heavy.

864
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:04,106
What?
- It's really heavy.

865
01:25:05,108 --> 01:25:06,700
I can kick your ass
and make it lighter.

866
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:09,544
I don't pay you for your
company, move it!

867
01:25:15,452 --> 01:25:16,749
Spread it on the sacks.

868
01:25:24,127 --> 01:25:28,120
Where does the rest go?
- Kashimira. Near Thane.

869
01:25:42,145 --> 01:25:43,476
Hey, come here.

870
01:25:44,581 --> 01:25:47,311
What's this?
- I don't know, sir.

871
01:25:47,384 --> 01:25:49,682
They told me it belongs
to Jindran sir.

872
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,210
Jindran? - Yes.

873
01:25:51,288 --> 01:25:53,620
But there's no work
going on right now.

874
01:25:55,292 --> 01:25:59,353
Uncle. - What's in it?
- No idea.

875
01:26:16,179 --> 01:26:19,842
One ton of this stuff? Excellent.

876
01:26:22,653 --> 01:26:26,851
It'll be half a million.?
- Half a million? Are you nuts?

877
01:26:26,923 --> 01:26:33,795
Why so much? You just
have to get rid of it.

878
01:26:33,864 --> 01:26:35,456
Do you know what this is?

879
01:26:35,532 --> 01:26:37,397
You're getting off easy.

880
01:26:38,201 --> 01:26:42,194
But I didn't know... Yeda asked
me to stash it for a while.

881
01:26:42,272 --> 01:26:44,137
I couldn't refuse. We do major
business with Majid.

882
01:26:44,207 --> 01:26:48,303
Then check it out yourself!
Or ask Majid directly.

883
01:26:48,378 --> 01:26:50,141
Where do we find Yeda?

884
01:26:50,213 --> 01:26:53,182
I'd tell you if I knew. You
should ask his brother.

885
01:26:53,283 --> 01:26:54,580
Where's Yeda?

886
01:26:54,651 --> 01:26:56,243
I don't know.

887
01:26:58,622 --> 01:27:01,819
Does that jog your memory...?
- He wasn't here on March 12.

888
01:27:02,726 --> 01:27:04,819
You think we're fucking idiots?

889
01:27:05,228 --> 01:27:06,661
You're married Majid,
what's her name...?

890
01:27:10,667 --> 01:27:12,157
What?
- Nafisa?

891
01:27:13,236 --> 01:27:15,830
You're wanted at the police
station. - I'm not well.

892
01:27:15,906 --> 01:27:20,570
No one asked if you were.
Get moving. I'll show you.

893
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,917
I'm not well.

894
01:27:38,695 --> 01:27:39,923
She's not well?

895
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:44,367
Tell me where Yeda is.

896
01:27:45,602 --> 01:27:47,797
I don't know anything.

897
01:28:05,288 --> 01:28:06,550
Doesn't know anything?

898
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:19,167
BwTorrents. Com

899
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:22,304
We didn't do anything, honestly.

900
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:33,680
Every person we arrest
says they're innocent.

901
01:28:34,751 --> 01:28:36,878
Being kind and patient doesn't
help us learn the truth.

902
01:28:36,953 --> 01:28:39,319
So we use other methods.

903
01:28:39,389 --> 01:28:42,449
People say there's been a
violation of Human rights.?

904
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:45,518
Human rights? - Yes. - Tell those
people to try solving this case.

905
01:28:45,595 --> 01:28:48,325
More than 400 innocent people were
blown to shreds in the blasts.

906
01:28:48,398 --> 01:28:52,994
There was no criminal among them.
What about their human rights?

907
01:28:54,604 --> 01:28:57,266
For every ten guilty, we may bring
in someone who's innocent.

908
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:58,830
I'm not perfect, nobody is.

909
01:28:59,342 --> 01:29:03,472
They aren't small time criminals.
They think this is jihad.

910
01:29:04,781 --> 01:29:07,579
They're the worst kind, they
work like terrorists.

911
01:29:08,685 --> 01:29:10,880
Chop off their fingers and they
still wouldn't say a word.

912
01:29:12,355 --> 01:29:15,290
They won't open their mouths until
you strip them of their dignity.

913
01:29:15,358 --> 01:29:18,850
They can't bear to see their women,
children and near ones humiliated.

914
01:29:34,644 --> 01:29:37,306
Hello Sir, Yeda Yakub here.

915
01:29:38,348 --> 01:29:42,011
The police have taken
Majid and Nafisa.

916
01:29:42,118 --> 01:29:45,053
I didn't pick them up.
- They're being tortured.

917
01:29:45,388 --> 01:29:48,380
The police think I have something
to do with the blasts.

918
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:51,916
That's not true. Please
get them out, sir.

919
01:29:51,995 --> 01:29:53,394
I'm not on the case.

920
01:29:53,463 --> 01:29:59,402
There is some Naik, sir. I'm being
set up by my enemies.

921
01:30:00,403 --> 01:30:03,895
I wasn't even here on March 12.

922
01:30:03,974 --> 01:30:08,411
Neither was Tiger. Why don't you
come in and sort this out?

923
01:30:08,478 --> 01:30:11,413
I can't, I'll never
be let out again.

924
01:30:11,481 --> 01:30:12,846
Then I can't help you.

925
01:30:13,383 --> 01:30:14,577
Sir.

926
01:30:16,853 --> 01:30:18,320
Bastard!

927
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:38,964
Tiger bhai, it's Yeda.

928
01:30:40,443 --> 01:30:44,971
The cops have picked
up Majid and Nafisa.

929
01:30:46,883 --> 01:30:48,976
This is jihad. Sacrifice
is inevitable.

930
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:51,682
True, bhai.

931
01:30:52,722 --> 01:30:58,126
Something. Please do
something, bhai.

932
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:02,129
Please talk to Dawood bhai.

933
01:31:03,733 --> 01:31:07,464
Sure, I'll see what I can do.

934
01:31:08,471 --> 01:31:10,996
Bloody lying son of a bitch!

935
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:28,422
Tell me... - Boss knows
you handled the RDX.

936
01:31:28,491 --> 01:31:35,090
What? You're telling me
now! - I just found out.

937
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,660
I told you.

938
01:31:38,735 --> 01:31:41,499
Sir, Majid and Nafisa
are in bad shape.

939
01:31:41,571 --> 01:31:44,165
It's a jail cell Yeda,
not a hospital.

940
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:47,004
Please, I'll do whatever
you want me to.

941
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:53,176
It's a trick, you fool. You can go
in, but they won't set Majid free.

942
01:31:53,249 --> 01:31:57,083
Piloo Khan has a hand in this.
I know for sure.

943
01:31:58,488 --> 01:32:00,183
I won't spare the fucker.

944
01:32:00,256 --> 01:32:02,986
Hang on, listen.
- I'm not going to spare the bastard

945
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:05,755
You will repent.
- You stay out of it.

946
01:32:07,530 --> 01:32:09,725
Sir, I'll give you a solid
piece of information.

947
01:32:10,533 --> 01:32:14,526
On one condition. You
let my brother go.

948
01:32:14,604 --> 01:32:17,767
I'll speak to my superiors.
- It's genuine.

949
01:32:17,841 --> 01:32:19,468
What is it? - Let Majid go.

950
01:32:19,542 --> 01:32:21,976
I'll try. Tell me.

951
01:32:25,815 --> 01:32:27,476
Tiger has stashed the RDX...

952
01:32:27,517 --> 01:32:32,545
in a warehouse near Amrut Nagar.

953
01:32:32,622 --> 01:32:34,214
Black soap.

954
01:32:35,892 --> 01:32:37,223
Zanjeer, good boy.

955
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:50,038
All you can smell is fish!

956
01:32:50,573 --> 01:32:52,564
It's all just dried fish.

957
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:54,906
I think he conned us.

958
01:32:54,978 --> 01:32:56,707
Double check it all. - Yes sir.

959
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:00,912
Why would he lie?

960
01:33:20,603 --> 01:33:21,831
Get me a knife.

961
01:33:44,894 --> 01:33:48,625
Wait! There is something.

962
01:33:48,698 --> 01:33:50,632
There is something.

963
01:33:54,637 --> 01:34:00,735
What is this?

964
01:34:35,678 --> 01:34:37,805
58 sacks in all. - 58?

965
01:34:39,649 --> 01:34:43,642
All marked with blue circles, like
the ones we found in Mumbra.

966
01:34:51,027 --> 01:34:55,157
Yes Dangle. - Sir, the RDX
came in these cartons.

967
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:58,962
They're marked with a blue circle.

968
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:08,972
Hello. - Sir, Piloo Khan was also
Involved with the blasts.

969
01:35:09,045 --> 01:35:10,171
Who is this?

970
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:13,841
He is Dawood's hitman.
He's still in Bombay.

971
01:35:13,883 --> 01:35:16,147
Who's speaking?
- A well wisher.

972
01:35:16,686 --> 01:35:19,246
Don't you want to take revenge?

973
01:35:19,322 --> 01:35:23,122
I don't have a problem. Piloo
here has the problem.

974
01:35:23,726 --> 01:35:26,991
He comes on my turf and messes
with my operations.

975
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:29,993
There won't be problems anymore.

976
01:35:30,733 --> 01:35:34,669
Forget you ever had
any. Shake hands.

977
01:35:36,172 --> 01:35:37,400
Shake hands.

978
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:41,173
C'mon, for Dawood bhai.

979
01:35:41,744 --> 01:35:43,336
He's asking you to
forget the past.

980
01:35:45,181 --> 01:35:46,375
Shake hands.

981
01:36:00,029 --> 01:36:02,361
Please take off your shoes
before you come in.

982
01:36:03,766 --> 01:36:05,165
Piloo Khan?

983
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:08,862
He's not here.
- Where has he gone?

984
01:36:08,938 --> 01:36:10,963
I don't know.
- When's he expected?

985
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,098
I don't know.

986
01:36:12,775 --> 01:36:15,710
There's a Chinese joint in Bandra...

987
01:36:15,778 --> 01:36:18,338
'Stomach'. That's where
they usually sit.

988
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:20,714
Who all?

989
01:36:25,922 --> 01:36:28,356
Sir, the cops want you.

990
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:30,190
Calling me? - Yes.

991
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:52,007
Rajkumar Khurana is here.
Shall we interrogate him?

992
01:36:53,149 --> 01:36:54,776
Sit the rascal down
outside the lock-up.

993
01:36:55,785 --> 01:37:02,213
You go. - Dangle? - Yes sir?
- Sir, madam on the line.

994
01:37:04,827 --> 01:37:10,766
Go, make Noor Mohammed talk.
I'll join you.

995
01:37:11,167 --> 01:37:13,761
Kadam, open it up.

996
01:37:19,342 --> 01:37:21,776
Said anything yet?
- Not yet.

997
01:37:21,844 --> 01:37:24,836
Nothing?

998
01:37:26,115 --> 01:37:30,176
Hold my gun. - Yes sir.
- You, get up!

999
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:33,846
Tell me. Who else was with you?

1000
01:37:33,923 --> 01:37:37,290
Go there!

1001
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,123
Why have I been brought here?

1002
01:37:39,862 --> 01:37:41,454
What have I done?

1003
01:37:41,531 --> 01:37:43,123
Take your shoes off! This
is a police station.

1004
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:49,536
Sleeping? You think
you own this place?

1005
01:37:49,605 --> 01:37:52,438
Take off your socks! Take
off your socks!

1006
01:37:53,209 --> 01:37:56,406
I'll trample those feet!
You won't stand again!

1007
01:37:56,879 --> 01:38:00,042
Speak up! Who else was with you?

1008
01:38:00,149 --> 01:38:03,118
No... no one. Show me your hand.

1009
01:38:03,219 --> 01:38:04,413
Take the watch off!

1010
01:38:08,891 --> 01:38:10,324
Why are you shouting?

1011
01:38:13,896 --> 01:38:14,954
Shut up!

1012
01:38:15,898 --> 01:38:20,301
Keep it in Kadam. Lock it.
- I'll lock it sir.

1013
01:38:32,849 --> 01:38:33,873
Are you thirsty?

1014
01:38:34,851 --> 01:38:35,875
No.

1015
01:38:38,454 --> 01:38:39,921
Dangle sir. - Yes.

1016
01:38:43,192 --> 01:38:45,319
Has he said anything?
- Nothing.

1017
01:38:46,929 --> 01:38:48,362
What's your name?

1018
01:38:49,265 --> 01:38:52,132
Rakesh Khurana.
- Who's Rajkumar Khurana?

1019
01:38:52,869 --> 01:38:53,927
I am.

1020
01:38:54,003 --> 01:38:56,938
Can't you tell us your full name?
- What do you do?

1021
01:38:58,941 --> 01:39:02,502
I own a restaurant
in Bandra. Stomach.

1022
01:39:02,578 --> 01:39:04,944
Big deal!
- Do you know Piloo Khan?

1023
01:39:07,917 --> 01:39:10,078
He's a friend.
- Where is he?

1024
01:39:10,119 --> 01:39:11,916
What has he done?

1025
01:39:13,222 --> 01:39:15,952
Answer to the point!
Where the is he?

1026
01:39:19,228 --> 01:39:20,627
I don't know.

1027
01:39:26,636 --> 01:39:30,094
Kadam. - Yes sir? - Lock him up.

1028
01:39:31,974 --> 01:39:33,168
Sir. - Sit.

1029
01:39:41,417 --> 01:39:43,510
I'm going to rest for a while,
you don't need me, right?

1030
01:39:43,953 --> 01:39:45,011
No.

1031
01:39:49,525 --> 01:39:51,584
Whose lawyer is that?
- Khurana's.

1032
01:39:51,994 --> 01:39:53,928
The Court has ordered his release.

1033
01:40:03,272 --> 01:40:04,466
Come on.

1034
01:40:05,441 --> 01:40:07,204
Prepare the documents. - Yes sir.

1035
01:40:10,012 --> 01:40:11,946
You're Khurana's lawyer?
- Yes.

1036
01:40:12,014 --> 01:40:14,448
The formalities will be done by
morning. Then we'll let him go.

1037
01:40:14,984 --> 01:40:16,645
Where's Kadam?
- Downstairs.

1038
01:40:16,986 --> 01:40:18,977
Get him here. - Sir that...
- Sit here.

1039
01:40:20,356 --> 01:40:24,690
Open the door. - Get up!

1040
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:31,029
Get in! I said get in!
Sit down! Sit!

1041
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:34,558
Wait! Wait there I said.

1042
01:40:34,637 --> 01:40:37,572
Don't talk rubbish I said.

1043
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:41,542
Quiet! No noise. - What is your
name? - Rajkumar Khurana.

1044
01:40:41,611 --> 01:40:44,239
Get up! - He got up!

1045
01:40:44,313 --> 01:40:46,679
You will become old.

1046
01:40:46,716 --> 01:40:49,207
Show me his face.

1047
01:40:49,285 --> 01:40:52,186
Are you sisters?
- She is my daughter.

1048
01:42:01,557 --> 01:42:06,790
Khurana!

1049
01:43:55,771 --> 01:44:00,231
We hadn't arrested Khurana.
We had only interrogated him.

1050
01:44:00,309 --> 01:44:04,177
We didn't suspect him.
We knew that he didn't know...

1051
01:44:04,246 --> 01:44:06,214
...what Piloo Khan does.

1052
01:44:06,315 --> 01:44:09,182
Samra says there's no smoke
without fire. He says...

1053
01:44:09,218 --> 01:44:11,186
...this man wouldn't have
killed himself...

1054
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:12,915
. if he hadn't felt really guilty.

1055
01:44:12,988 --> 01:44:15,183
Olga Tellis writes in
the Sunday Observer

1056
01:44:15,257 --> 01:44:18,249
The police have tended to preen
...they congratulate themselves...

1057
01:44:18,327 --> 01:44:20,192
on the completion of their task,
when in actual fact...

1058
01:44:20,262 --> 01:44:23,390
all that they have accomplished is
the arrest of a bunch of coolies.

1059
01:44:29,605 --> 01:44:33,666
Rakesh Maria is right. It's been
two weeks since we last met...

1060
01:44:34,276 --> 01:44:36,608
but I still remember his words.

1061
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:41,238
If Allah had been with us, our
plan would have succeeded.

1062
01:44:42,251 --> 01:44:47,951
Mantralaya, Sena Bhavan, Bal
Thackeray... all destroyed.

1063
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:52,226
That did not happen because
Allah willed otherwise.

1064
01:44:52,328 --> 01:44:55,786
"It swung..."

1065
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:01,565
"A cradle of gypsies swung..."

1066
01:45:01,637 --> 01:45:04,231
Some water please?

1067
01:45:05,307 --> 01:45:07,241
Get him some water.

1068
01:45:07,309 --> 01:45:12,770
"I have read the Quran, but..."

1069
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:17,842
I want to meet Maria sir.
- Why?

1070
01:45:19,288 --> 01:45:21,256
I have something to tell him.

1071
01:45:21,323 --> 01:45:24,986
He'll send for you if he needs
to. - It's important.

1072
01:45:25,661 --> 01:45:28,596
It's important. Just mention it,
Tell him it's Badshah Khan.

1073
01:45:28,664 --> 01:45:30,325
I now realise it. Tiger used us.

1074
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:35,336
He bore heavy losses
during the riots.

1075
01:45:35,604 --> 01:45:37,663
His office was torched.

1076
01:45:40,342 --> 01:45:41,673
He betrayed us.

1077
01:45:43,345 --> 01:45:45,336
He escaped and left us behind.

1078
01:45:47,316 --> 01:45:48,908
He burnt our passports.

1079
01:45:51,821 --> 01:45:54,289
From Delhi to Jaipur,
back to Delhi...

1080
01:45:54,356 --> 01:45:57,757
to Rampur to Tonk to
Calcutta to Rampur...

1081
01:45:59,361 --> 01:46:00,692
I was kicked around.

1082
01:46:01,363 --> 01:46:03,456
Finally he stopped taking
my phone calls.

1083
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:12,033
I want to become a state witness.
- Make an official request.

1084
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:17,302
Mr. M.N. Singh... My
name is Badshah Khan.

1085
01:46:17,379 --> 01:46:20,940
I met Javed Chikna, resident
of Mahim, two years ago.

1086
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:22,347
Writing a letter?

1087
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,320
It was at a business meeting
at Chikna's place...

1088
01:46:27,389 --> 01:46:30,916
where I first met Tiger.

1089
01:46:31,927 --> 01:46:35,920
I've known about him ever since.

1090
01:46:37,733 --> 01:46:41,066
In the December 1992 riots...

1091
01:46:41,937 --> 01:46:44,462
Javed was wounded
by a police bullet.

1092
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:47,407
Where are you going?
- To the station.

1093
01:46:47,877 --> 01:46:51,870
Stay here!
- I'll be back soon.

1094
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:53,574
Who's there?
- Shahnawaz.

1095
01:46:54,383 --> 01:46:57,045
Shall I go? - Greetings.

1096
01:46:57,086 --> 01:47:03,616
Greetings. - Yes, what is it?

1097
01:47:03,692 --> 01:47:08,857
The police shot Chikna. What? He's
at National hospital.

1098
01:47:23,946 --> 01:47:25,971
Javed Chikna?

1099
01:47:26,415 --> 01:47:28,815
It's Tailor.
- Sorry, Javed Dawood Tailor.

1100
01:47:28,918 --> 01:47:31,386
This lot's already dead.
Ask over there.

1101
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:33,911
Check inside.

1102
01:47:56,745 --> 01:47:57,803
Badshah.

1103
01:48:06,956 --> 01:48:09,481
Javed. - Greetings. - Greetings.

1104
01:48:12,761 --> 01:48:17,425
Even the police!
They're all a part of this.

1105
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:22,766
They opened fire on us! Now
they are watching our backs.

1106
01:48:22,838 --> 01:48:28,435
A few weeks later, my
friend Aziz's son died.

1107
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:32,446
He'd poisoned himself.
I went for the funeral.

1108
01:48:32,514 --> 01:48:34,846
There I ran into Javed again.

1109
01:48:35,484 --> 01:48:40,444
We were sitting at Aziz's place,
then Tiger's man Shafi came.

1110
01:48:41,056 --> 01:48:45,789
He took Javed aside, they spoke.

1111
01:48:46,996 --> 01:48:49,658
Javed bhai, he's calling you.

1112
01:48:50,532 --> 01:48:56,528
You're free tonight? Tiger bhai's
expecting a shipment. Come along.

1113
01:48:56,605 --> 01:48:57,799
But where are you going?

1114
01:48:58,540 --> 01:48:59,939
I told you, I don't know.

1115
01:49:01,543 --> 01:49:02,601
Who's going with you?

1116
01:49:03,812 --> 01:49:04,870
Shahnawaz will be there.

1117
01:49:06,882 --> 01:49:08,110
Money has to come from somewhere.

1118
01:49:08,517 --> 01:49:11,918
I can't go to work anymore, can
I? We need to eat, don't we?

1119
01:49:13,555 --> 01:49:14,886
Take him along, too.

1120
01:49:17,559 --> 01:49:19,550
He stays here! With you.

1121
01:49:22,097 --> 01:49:25,225
Every time I have to call and
ask whose number is what.

1122
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:27,029
You have come.

1123
01:49:27,102 --> 01:49:30,902
I thought you had been
killed on the way.

1124
01:49:31,573 --> 01:49:33,063
What news? Come in.

1125
01:49:33,575 --> 01:49:38,512
Look at the hotel. Superb.

1126
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:41,549
It will soon become a 5-star.

1127
01:49:41,650 --> 01:49:46,178
It's great.

1128
01:49:46,255 --> 01:49:51,022
Badshah, he had come
out 30 years ago.

1129
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:52,986
Like me.

1130
01:49:59,601 --> 01:50:03,264
I'll hit him. - Come. - Okay.

1131
01:50:03,338 --> 01:50:05,272
Come on.

1132
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:08,537
He's been landing Tiger's
consignments of silver...

1133
01:50:08,610 --> 01:50:10,805
for the last two years.

1134
01:50:10,879 --> 01:50:15,839
Tiger paid him 1.5 million
to get in the RDX.

1135
01:50:16,952 --> 01:50:18,544
He used to pay the locals
of Raigad a...

1136
01:50:18,587 --> 01:50:21,021
...few hundred bucks
to work for him.

1137
01:50:21,090 --> 01:50:23,149
They never sold him out
once, out of fear.

1138
01:50:23,225 --> 01:50:27,127
He had the police, the customs...
all eating out of his hand.

1139
01:50:27,896 --> 01:50:30,558
Dawood Phanse?

1140
01:50:30,632 --> 01:50:33,192
Yes.

1141
01:50:33,635 --> 01:50:36,035
Bombay Police. - Leave me!

1142
01:50:36,772 --> 01:50:39,741
Greetings. Greetings sir.

1143
01:50:40,809 --> 01:50:46,805
I have two partners. Dadabhai
Parker and Rahim Laundrywala.

1144
01:50:46,915 --> 01:50:49,008
We have been doing this
for the last five years.

1145
01:50:49,618 --> 01:50:50,983
Smuggling.

1146
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:55,784
We've been working for Tiger
Memon for more than a year now.

1147
01:50:55,858 --> 01:50:59,259
Till date, we've handled
six landings for him.

1148
01:50:59,661 --> 01:51:03,654
The first four were silver bars,
and the other two...

1149
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,725
Stop that banging!

1150
01:51:09,671 --> 01:51:13,198
You think it's the radio? Can't
you pick up the phone?

1151
01:51:13,675 --> 01:51:17,873
Who did you get... - Hello.
- Baldie... - Yes, Tiger bhai?

1152
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:20,341
The landing's at Mhasla.

1153
01:51:20,415 --> 01:51:22,144
Whose stuff is it?
- Dawood bhai's.

1154
01:51:22,251 --> 01:51:23,650
And what if it isn't?

1155
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:28,879
Take my guarantee. Dawood
Bhai is sending it himself.

1156
01:51:28,957 --> 01:51:31,858
He never said anything to me.
- My word isn't good enough?

1157
01:51:31,927 --> 01:51:36,296
Fine, what will convince you?

1158
01:51:36,365 --> 01:51:39,698
A guarantee of profit...
not like the last time.

1159
01:51:39,768 --> 01:51:43,226
Tell Dawood bhai if he
calls me personally...

1160
01:51:43,305 --> 01:51:46,297
Look Phanse get the goods,
I'll do it.

1161
01:51:46,375 --> 01:51:48,639
You want to talk to Dawood bha?

1162
01:51:50,245 --> 01:51:53,043
Why on the phone?

1163
01:51:54,683 --> 01:51:57,049
Why not in person?

1164
01:51:57,152 --> 01:51:59,620
One silver bar weighs
about 30 kilos.

1165
01:52:00,722 --> 01:52:03,384
For every landing we have
to pay off officials...

1166
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:09,654
customs, police, revenue department.

1167
01:52:10,999 --> 01:52:14,298
So that the goods are unloaded
and reach the city safely.

1168
01:52:14,736 --> 01:52:17,170
We get 7000 for each bar.

1169
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:21,402
But the last shipment was less.
We ran into a loss.

1170
01:52:21,476 --> 01:52:23,944
Why?
- Everyone's cut is fixed.

1171
01:52:24,012 --> 01:52:27,004
The more the bars, the
more the profit.

1172
01:52:27,082 --> 01:52:31,815
Only 65 bars came in last time.
We fell out over that.

1173
01:52:31,887 --> 01:52:35,288
If he hadn't mentioned Dawood bhai,
I would never have agreed.

1174
01:52:36,024 --> 01:52:39,960
Not Phaanse. Phanse.

1175
01:52:40,062 --> 01:52:43,225
Yes... yes I am Dawood Phanse.

1176
01:52:43,765 --> 01:52:46,325
Greetings.

1177
01:52:46,401 --> 01:52:49,768
They called my name... - The
plane's waiting for you sir.

1178
01:53:14,796 --> 01:53:16,821
Dawood lives here?

1179
01:53:19,801 --> 01:53:21,996
Take it easy.

1180
01:53:23,805 --> 01:53:26,797
Baldie, sit.

1181
01:53:44,826 --> 01:53:45,918
Hello?

1182
01:53:59,841 --> 01:54:00,967
Salaam.

1183
01:54:16,958 --> 01:54:19,927
Elder sister.

1184
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:41,849
Salaam, Dawood.

1185
01:54:41,950 --> 01:54:44,817
I don't want tea. No, thanks.

1186
01:54:44,853 --> 01:54:45,945
Can he pull it off?

1187
01:54:46,021 --> 01:54:49,149
Tiger thought I should come, I
asked to see, I wanted to see...

1188
01:54:55,097 --> 01:54:56,928
Why are you here?

1189
01:54:57,366 --> 01:55:01,427
I wanted to see you. Tiger bhai
said he'll fix a meeting for me.

1190
01:55:01,503 --> 01:55:05,564
What?
- No tea. Thank you.

1191
01:55:08,910 --> 01:55:10,104
A meeting?

1192
01:55:10,912 --> 01:55:14,143
It was my desire to see you,
so I asked Tiger bhai...

1193
01:55:14,349 --> 01:55:18,342
Give him whatever he wants.
His concerns are my concerns.

1194
01:55:18,887 --> 01:55:22,983
I just wanted to know what
stuff is being shipped this time...

1195
01:55:29,364 --> 01:55:30,422
Chemicals.

1196
01:55:31,066 --> 01:55:32,124
Chemicals.

1197
01:55:33,101 --> 01:55:34,227
Any doubts?

1198
01:55:34,936 --> 01:55:37,928
None. Forgive me.
You can count on me.

1199
01:55:49,918 --> 01:55:52,284
Dawood...

1200
01:55:52,921 --> 01:55:55,082
Make a parallel team.

1201
01:55:55,390 --> 01:55:58,291
Something goes wrong with one,
we can fall back on the other.

1202
01:55:58,427 --> 01:56:00,952
Who's sending it, where it's
coming from, I have no idea.

1203
01:56:01,963 --> 01:56:04,329
Another thing: Make a list
of those we have to pay off.

1204
01:56:05,967 --> 01:56:08,959
100,000, right Mr. Navalkar?

1205
01:56:09,104 --> 01:56:10,298
You'll get it.

1206
01:56:11,139 --> 01:56:14,370
But you've got to
cooperate hundred percent.

1207
01:56:15,977 --> 01:56:17,069
Don't worry.

1208
01:56:17,279 --> 01:56:19,907
Sub-inspector Rane and Kadam sa'ab...

1209
01:56:19,948 --> 01:56:25,011
have already accepted the offer.
Everybody does it, it's cool.

1210
01:56:28,256 --> 01:56:29,314
He's come.

1211
01:56:29,391 --> 01:56:32,258
It's the usual stuff, but I
don't know when it's arriving.

1212
01:56:32,327 --> 01:56:34,022
You must have some idea.

1213
01:56:34,996 --> 01:56:39,160
I'm sure that there's a time,
but I don't know it as yet.

1214
01:56:39,301 --> 01:56:40,996
One of Tiger Memon's shipments?

1215
01:56:42,170 --> 01:56:44,001
Or maybe the ISI?

1216
01:56:44,272 --> 01:56:46,365
This one will really cost you.

1217
01:56:46,475 --> 01:56:52,004
He already knew what the
stuff was and who was sending it.

1218
01:57:01,022 --> 01:57:04,480
Thapa. Tell him the names
of the officers involved.

1219
01:57:06,027 --> 01:57:11,260
Answer to the point.
Don't get too excited.

1220
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:14,333
No
- Badshah.

1221
01:57:15,036 --> 01:57:17,027
Come on.

1222
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:21,065
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1223
01:57:22,511 --> 01:57:27,210
So you're Badshah Khan...?

1224
01:57:27,282 --> 01:57:28,306
Yes, bhai.

1225
01:57:31,019 --> 01:57:32,179
Sit.

1226
01:57:34,322 --> 01:57:39,225
What is it? Didn't sleep last night?

1227
01:57:39,361 --> 01:57:40,419
I did.

1228
01:57:43,398 --> 01:57:45,195
Your eyes are bloodshot.

1229
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:51,063
The drive, the wind...

1230
01:57:51,706 --> 01:57:58,168
Badshah, the king. The
king of what exactly?

1231
01:58:07,522 --> 01:58:10,423
Do you pray?
- Yes, bhai.

1232
01:58:13,094 --> 01:58:14,186
All five times?

1233
01:58:15,263 --> 01:58:16,389
Yes.

1234
01:58:18,099 --> 01:58:19,191
Well...

1235
01:58:20,235 --> 01:58:22,499
Sometimes it's a little
difficult but mostly, yes

1236
01:58:22,771 --> 01:58:29,233
Where were you when
the riots broke out?

1237
01:58:30,245 --> 01:58:33,442
I was there, in Bombay.

1238
01:58:33,682 --> 01:58:35,149
How many Hindus did you kill?

1239
01:58:35,183 --> 01:58:36,275
What?

1240
01:58:40,088 --> 01:58:44,149
Lost someone dear to you?

1241
01:58:46,127 --> 01:58:47,219
Well...

1242
01:58:50,131 --> 01:58:53,259
I lost my livelihood.

1243
01:58:53,435 --> 01:58:55,369
Doesn't it make your blood boil?

1244
01:58:57,138 --> 01:58:59,163
In the last riots...

1245
01:59:00,141 --> 01:59:02,268
in Pratiksha Nagar...

1246
01:59:03,144 --> 01:59:08,104
those Hindu pimps posed
as housing officials...

1247
01:59:08,283 --> 01:59:10,217
went to every Muslim home...

1248
01:59:10,318 --> 01:59:12,513
and marked it with white chalk.

1249
01:59:13,588 --> 01:59:16,079
Then on the 8th, or
the 9th, they came back...

1250
01:59:16,157 --> 01:59:19,092
destroyed those houses...
everything. Fine.

1251
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:22,493
That was still bearable.

1252
01:59:24,332 --> 01:59:26,391
They killed the people who
lived there. Even that's ok.

1253
01:59:29,371 --> 01:59:34,104
But they dragged our
womenfolk out into the streets...

1254
01:59:34,476 --> 01:59:36,740
and raped them!

1255
01:59:38,613 --> 01:59:42,447
My man Hanif Qureishi...

1256
01:59:43,151 --> 01:59:44,311
was butchered.

1257
01:59:48,289 --> 01:59:50,314
Over there, they stoned the mosque.

1258
01:59:52,193 --> 01:59:56,755
They set four people
aflame in a Maruti car.

1259
01:59:58,333 --> 02:00:02,736
Just 400 feet away
was the police station.

1260
02:00:04,205 --> 02:00:08,232
Did any help come from there? Never.

1261
02:00:10,645 --> 02:00:11,703
You read the Quran?

1262
02:00:12,213 --> 02:00:13,305
Yes, bhai.

1263
02:00:15,183 --> 02:00:17,242
Have you been there, to Pakistan?

1264
02:00:17,485 --> 02:00:21,444
No, never had the chance.

1265
02:00:24,559 --> 02:00:27,460
Where are you from?
- Bombay, bhai.

1266
02:00:28,229 --> 02:00:29,355
Hometown?

1267
02:00:31,366 --> 02:00:33,596
Rampur

1268
02:00:33,735 --> 02:00:35,225
You didn't kill even one Hindu?

1269
02:00:45,246 --> 02:00:49,307
It's time to pay them back.

1270
02:00:50,585 --> 02:00:55,454
If you breathe a word
to anyone about this...

1271
02:00:57,358 --> 02:01:00,191
to your parents, brothers, sisters...

1272
02:01:00,395 --> 02:01:04,491
wife, kids, friends, anyone at all...

1273
02:01:07,702 --> 02:01:09,329
I'll bury you...

1274
02:01:10,271 --> 02:01:12,831
...after I bury your
whole fucking family!

1275
02:01:16,811 --> 02:01:27,949
BwTorrents. Com

1276
02:01:47,308 --> 02:01:49,333
Greetings.

1277
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:51,435
I don't see Phanse.

1278
02:01:51,579 --> 02:01:55,276
You know how it is. He's
taking care of some loose ends.

1279
02:01:55,483 --> 02:01:57,883
He had said something else. He's
saying this is not acceptable.

1280
02:01:57,952 --> 02:01:59,749
Talking about society!

1281
02:02:47,535 --> 02:02:52,404
Greetings Mushtaq.
- Come.

1282
02:02:53,374 --> 02:02:56,366
God willing, we'll go
down in history for this.

1283
02:02:57,478 --> 02:02:59,946
This one is packed with grenades.

1284
02:03:03,351 --> 02:03:08,653
Shift. Carefully boys!

1285
02:03:11,392 --> 02:03:16,386
Easy, easy... Watch your feet.

1286
02:03:16,464 --> 02:03:20,423
The foot is touching it.
Do you want to go or not?

1287
02:03:48,529 --> 02:03:52,795
Oh! What things!

1288
02:03:54,435 --> 02:03:56,460
What the... what is this?

1289
02:03:56,738 --> 02:03:58,433
AK 56.

1290
02:03:58,573 --> 02:03:59,733
The Pakistani army's stuff.

1291
02:04:02,443 --> 02:04:06,004
What things! - Bombay's going to
burn like one big firecracker.

1292
02:04:15,456 --> 02:04:19,586
RDX and AK 56... it
was all new to us.

1293
02:04:19,761 --> 02:04:22,457
Tiger said we would
be sent for training...

1294
02:04:22,730 --> 02:04:23,788
Islamabad.

1295
02:04:23,932 --> 02:04:26,457
Pakistan?
- Yes.

1296
02:04:26,601 --> 02:04:28,967
But how will we get there?

1297
02:04:30,805 --> 02:04:32,705
Dawood bha's 'Khancha'.

1298
02:04:32,907 --> 02:04:34,670
Khancha?
- An arrangement.

1299
02:04:35,910 --> 02:04:37,400
I don't know how...

1300
02:04:37,612 --> 02:04:40,445
But all the big mob
bosses in Dubai have it.

1301
02:04:40,815 --> 02:04:43,045
It allows them entry into
Pakistan without a visa.

1302
02:04:43,451 --> 02:04:46,420
On February 11, 1993 seven of us...

1303
02:04:46,454 --> 02:04:48,718
flew to Dubai on Cathay Pacific.

1304
02:04:49,490 --> 02:04:53,483
There we met Ayub, who
put us up in an apartment.

1305
02:04:53,928 --> 02:04:57,625
On the 13th we were taken
on Paled lbis to Islamabad...

1306
02:04:58,099 --> 02:05:01,535
Paled lbis?
- PIA. Pakistan Airlines.

1307
02:05:02,603 --> 02:05:06,505
When we reached Pakistan
we didn't have any visas.

1308
02:05:06,641 --> 02:05:07,801
There was this man
there called Jaafar.

1309
02:05:08,509 --> 02:05:13,640
He took us through quietly. No
one stopped us or asked anything.

1310
02:05:13,715 --> 02:05:17,981
They gave us new names.
I was called Nasir.

1311
02:05:20,054 --> 02:05:23,512
The next night we were
sent to a training camp...

1312
02:05:24,525 --> 02:05:26,993
two or three hours
away in the mountains.

1313
02:05:29,530 --> 02:05:31,555
Two men were waiting for us,
they looked like real soldiers.

1314
02:05:32,533 --> 02:05:34,694
We were shivering in the cold...

1315
02:05:34,769 --> 02:05:36,828
whereas they could have
been standing in a desert.

1316
02:05:37,739 --> 02:05:39,673
Move on.

1317
02:05:39,974 --> 02:05:41,999
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1318
02:05:42,076 --> 02:05:45,534
How have you been?
- Allah is kind.

1319
02:05:46,547 --> 02:05:51,575
Boys, this is Babaji.
From here, he takes charge.

1320
02:05:53,521 --> 02:05:55,716
Get up, move. Everyone!

1321
02:05:58,726 --> 02:06:00,591
Had enough sleep.

1322
02:06:00,795 --> 02:06:01,853
Out!

1323
02:06:04,565 --> 02:06:07,932
What time is it?
- It's only 8:30.

1324
02:06:08,002 --> 02:06:11,665
Not even two hours of sleep.

1325
02:06:30,591 --> 02:06:34,049
Three more boys joined us on
the 17th. That made us 19 in all.

1326
02:06:34,128 --> 02:06:35,186
Yusuf

1327
02:06:35,596 --> 02:06:36,688
Aslam

1328
02:06:38,766 --> 02:06:39,892
Akram

1329
02:06:39,967 --> 02:06:41,025
Your real names...?

1330
02:06:41,202 --> 02:06:43,636
One of them was Gullu. He was
wanted for the Behrampada riots.

1331
02:06:43,905 --> 02:06:45,532
Later, just before the
blast he gave himself up

1332
02:06:45,606 --> 02:06:47,767
...at Navpada police station.

1333
02:06:47,909 --> 02:06:49,672
No more of this vegetarian shit.

1334
02:06:49,877 --> 02:06:52,607
You want to be solid
men, you eat beef.

1335
02:06:52,914 --> 02:06:54,040
Down!

1336
02:06:55,049 --> 02:06:56,073
Up!

1337
02:06:56,584 --> 02:06:57,676
Down!

1338
02:06:58,753 --> 02:06:59,879
Up!

1339
02:07:00,588 --> 02:07:05,616
December 6 was a
fateful day for us Muslims.

1340
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:11,699
Accursed are those politicians
who martyred our sacred mosque.

1341
02:07:12,633 --> 02:07:14,658
They wrought great
suffering upon us.

1342
02:07:14,769 --> 02:07:17,636
Reduced our houses
and shops to ashes.

1343
02:07:17,805 --> 02:07:20,103
Our brothers were
needlessly drawn and quartered.

1344
02:07:20,308 --> 02:07:24,642
Our women were...

1345
02:07:24,779 --> 02:07:28,613
...endlessly violated.

1346
02:07:28,916 --> 02:07:32,613
Allah comforts us.

1347
02:07:32,887 --> 02:07:39,656
But how long can we resign
ourselves to this suffering?

1348
02:07:51,672 --> 02:07:53,902
It looks just like a pencil.

1349
02:07:54,108 --> 02:07:58,010
It's called a detonator,
what is it...?

1350
02:07:58,079 --> 02:07:59,671
Detonator.

1351
02:07:59,814 --> 02:08:00,940
But we can call it a Pencil.

1352
02:08:01,649 --> 02:08:03,913
The red one sets the bomb
off in fifteen minutes...

1353
02:08:04,118 --> 02:08:07,144
the white one takes an hour, the
green one, two and a half hours.

1354
02:08:07,288 --> 02:08:09,688
There are two
kinds of hand grenades.

1355
02:08:10,992 --> 02:08:15,725
Pin mechanism and string.

1356
02:08:21,869 --> 02:08:23,700
Was that a dummy?

1357
02:08:27,708 --> 02:08:29,005
This is RDX...

1358
02:08:29,143 --> 02:08:31,703
Research Developed Explosive.

1359
02:08:31,913 --> 02:08:34,677
It was manufactured
after the Second World War.

1360
02:08:34,849 --> 02:08:36,942
Use it to make bombs...

1361
02:08:38,152 --> 02:08:42,851
Hit him!

1362
02:08:42,924 --> 02:08:45,654
Come on!

1363
02:08:57,838 --> 02:09:01,296
Train hard, okay boys?

1364
02:09:03,811 --> 02:09:07,804
Dawood bha says that
you're good boys...

1365
02:09:08,716 --> 02:09:14,018
if you pull this off,
he'll reward you.

1366
02:09:14,355 --> 02:09:15,788
We'll give it everything.

1367
02:09:15,856 --> 02:09:18,757
After that we went back to Dubai.

1368
02:09:19,894 --> 02:09:22,294
Back to the same apartment.

1369
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:23,795
In the evening Tiger
sent a car for us.

1370
02:09:24,932 --> 02:09:28,766
We were taken to Al
Rashidiya bungalow.

1371
02:09:29,971 --> 02:09:32,940
It was the first time we were
all together under the same roof.

1372
02:09:33,074 --> 02:09:34,769
We swear...

1373
02:09:34,909 --> 02:09:36,069
We swear...

1374
02:09:36,210 --> 02:09:41,739
to never breathe a word to
anyone about our mission.

1375
02:09:41,916 --> 02:09:45,750
To never breathe a word to
anyone about our mission.

1376
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:49,720
That we ever came to
Dubai or to Islamabad...

1377
02:09:49,790 --> 02:09:51,815
or that we received training.

1378
02:09:51,926 --> 02:09:54,724
That we ever came to
Dubai or to Islamabad...

1379
02:09:54,795 --> 02:09:56,763
or that we received training.

1380
02:09:56,897 --> 02:10:00,731
And if caught, we will not
give up or betray our brothers...

1381
02:10:00,935 --> 02:10:03,961
We will take this to the grave.

1382
02:10:04,105 --> 02:10:05,868
We swear it the Holy Quran

1383
02:10:06,007 --> 02:10:08,373
We swear it the Holy Quran

1384
02:10:08,442 --> 02:10:13,277
On the fourth I returned
to Bombay... all of us.

1385
02:10:13,814 --> 02:10:15,839
We must get the Airport.

1386
02:10:16,083 --> 02:10:18,745
If we take down even one
international flight...

1387
02:10:18,786 --> 02:10:21,050
the whole world will take notice.

1388
02:10:21,289 --> 02:10:23,757
And if Chembur oil refinery blows,

1389
02:10:23,824 --> 02:10:25,815
they'll shit in their pants.

1390
02:10:29,263 --> 02:10:32,960
What about the Municipal Corporation?
- Mushtaq has a contact there.

1391
02:10:33,834 --> 02:10:37,031
Then we made a list...

1392
02:10:45,446 --> 02:10:48,904
Badshah bhai, this
will be a piece of cake.

1393
02:10:49,116 --> 02:10:52,176
Then Gullu's brothers were arrested.

1394
02:10:52,820 --> 02:10:55,220
They had been hunting
for Gullu since the riots.

1395
02:10:56,324 --> 02:10:58,417
Gullu freaked and turned himself in.

1396
02:10:59,860 --> 02:11:01,885
Tiger bhai was livid.

1397
02:11:01,962 --> 02:11:03,020
Shoot him...

1398
02:11:05,333 --> 02:11:07,927
He's having a hard time.
- I told you! Knock him out!

1399
02:11:08,002 --> 02:11:09,162
Let me talk to him.

1400
02:11:15,876 --> 02:11:17,070
It won't help.

1401
02:11:17,311 --> 02:11:21,008
Let me at least try.

1402
02:11:23,851 --> 02:11:26,911
Take Chikna with you.
- Come on, let's go.

1403
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:32,220
And tell him to keep his mouth shut.

1404
02:11:32,326 --> 02:11:35,818
Tell him to remember what I said.
If he blows this for me...

1405
02:11:35,896 --> 02:11:39,195
I'll wipe his entire
family before I knock him out.

1406
02:11:39,333 --> 02:11:41,130
Okay bhai.
- Go.

1407
02:11:41,235 --> 02:11:42,327
Let's go.

1408
02:11:45,239 --> 02:11:47,901
Why does Tiger bhai talk like that?
- Shut up!

1409
02:11:48,909 --> 02:11:51,901
Do as you're told.
You're no one to question him.

1410
02:11:52,046 --> 02:11:54,071
No, I was just saying.

1411
02:11:56,083 --> 02:11:57,175
Chikna!
- Yes.

1412
02:12:01,989 --> 02:12:03,957
Wait, I'm coming as well.

1413
02:12:04,024 --> 02:12:05,082
This way, bhai.

1414
02:12:05,192 --> 02:12:07,854
"There is a fair..."

1415
02:12:07,928 --> 02:12:09,054
This is his place.

1416
02:12:09,230 --> 02:12:12,131
Go on, find him.

1417
02:12:12,266 --> 02:12:14,393
Search every inch.

1418
02:12:14,468 --> 02:12:17,096
"May you be blessed..."

1419
02:12:17,171 --> 02:12:18,229
Gullu.

1420
02:12:18,305 --> 02:12:24,938
"Today my beloved is going to wed..."

1421
02:12:25,079 --> 02:12:31,917
"The Saint is going to wed today..."

1422
02:12:33,921 --> 02:12:35,980
Gullu sold us out you know.

1423
02:12:36,123 --> 02:12:37,954
He turned out to be a fool.

1424
02:12:40,961 --> 02:12:42,986
This is a little problem.

1425
02:12:45,132 --> 02:12:47,066
This shouldn't have happened.

1426
02:12:47,968 --> 02:12:49,265
He could make trouble for us.

1427
02:12:49,637 --> 02:12:53,971
But I swear that's
not going to stop us.

1428
02:12:54,108 --> 02:12:56,008
That night we met at the garage...

1429
02:12:56,243 --> 02:12:58,143
and assembled bombs all night.

1430
02:12:59,079 --> 02:13:02,105
Before dawn Tiger
bhai left for Dubai

1431
02:13:02,950 --> 02:13:07,444
Sir. Sir.

1432
02:13:07,655 --> 02:13:10,988
We have filed a charge sheet.
- How long is the charge sheet?

1433
02:13:11,125 --> 02:13:13,992
A total of 189 people have
been named in the charge-sheet.

1434
02:13:14,161 --> 02:13:16,994
Public prosecutor?
- Ujwal Nikam.

1435
02:13:17,298 --> 02:13:19,027
Has anyone from the
Memon family been arrested?

1436
02:13:19,433 --> 02:13:23,494
No, but we are hopeful.
It's just a matter of time.

1437
02:14:03,611 --> 02:14:04,669
Yakub Memon.

1438
02:14:13,487 --> 02:14:14,977
No one else from the Memon family

1439
02:14:15,055 --> 02:14:17,216
...was involved in
the blasts. Only Tiger.

1440
02:14:17,725 --> 02:14:21,058
Taufiq Jaliawala and
Tiger engineered everything.

1441
02:14:21,195 --> 02:14:26,064
The ISI used Tiger. On their behalf,
Jaliawala coordinated from Dubai.

1442
02:14:26,233 --> 02:14:27,359
For the ISI?

1443
02:14:28,068 --> 02:14:30,593
For the ISI. For Pakistan.

1444
02:14:31,705 --> 02:14:35,072
You're saying that no one from
the Memon family was involved...

1445
02:14:35,209 --> 02:14:37,575
but you all knew about it?

1446
02:14:38,078 --> 02:14:39,204
We didn't.

1447
02:14:39,346 --> 02:14:42,611
Then why did you leave Bombay
exactly three days before the blasts?

1448
02:14:43,517 --> 02:14:45,314
Tiger got us tickets to Dubai...

1449
02:14:45,419 --> 02:14:47,614
so we went. We did
that all the time.

1450
02:14:47,755 --> 02:14:51,088
You went for
Jaliawala's daughter's wedding?

1451
02:14:51,225 --> 02:14:57,391
None of us went for it,
we were told not to.

1452
02:14:57,531 --> 02:14:59,089
By whom?
- Jaliawala.

1453
02:14:59,166 --> 02:15:01,031
Why?
- At the time...

1454
02:15:01,101 --> 02:15:03,467
it seemed odd. But I
think now we all know why.

1455
02:15:03,604 --> 02:15:06,095
Why did you come back?

1456
02:15:07,207 --> 02:15:10,040
We were living like
second class citizens there.

1457
02:15:10,110 --> 02:15:11,236
Really.

1458
02:15:12,246 --> 02:15:15,044
Then I met a lawyer in Dubai
who said that if I cooperated...

1459
02:15:15,082 --> 02:15:18,677
I would get some special
considerations, a lighter sentence.

1460
02:15:18,752 --> 02:15:22,313
What were you doing at
New Delhi railway station?

1461
02:15:22,489 --> 02:15:26,721
The CBI left me there. -
You're saying the CBI arrested you?

1462
02:15:27,595 --> 02:15:30,462
The first time I was
arrested at Katmandu Airport.

1463
02:15:30,564 --> 02:15:33,761
Then the CBI took me to
New Delhi railway station.

1464
02:15:35,135 --> 02:15:37,160
There they released me,
and arrested me once again.

1465
02:15:38,572 --> 02:15:43,134
One last question.
Where is Tiger Memon?

1466
02:15:44,144 --> 02:15:46,169
You have to ask the ISI that.

1467
02:15:47,147 --> 02:15:49,411
He's your brother, you
must know something.

1468
02:15:49,817 --> 02:15:53,275
I've had no contact with
him for the past year.

1469
02:15:53,587 --> 02:15:56,147
I have absolutely no
idea where he is right now.

1470
02:15:57,324 --> 02:16:03,160
It is reported that the Memon family
has sought shelter in Pakistan.

1471
02:16:03,464 --> 02:16:08,163
Will Pakistan assist in
anyway to extradite them?

1472
02:16:08,302 --> 02:16:12,636
I can assure you the Memon family
has not sought asylum in Pakistan.

1473
02:16:12,773 --> 02:16:16,174
We have not issued a visa to them.

1474
02:16:16,310 --> 02:16:20,178
We don't know the
Memon family at all.

1475
02:16:20,481 --> 02:16:23,143
Unless these visas have been
issued by the Indian government.

1476
02:16:23,317 --> 02:16:25,615
That's a little far-fetched,
that the very people we want...

1477
02:16:25,653 --> 02:16:27,621
...we will issue visas to them.
- Well, you never know...

1478
02:16:27,655 --> 02:16:34,185
...because these are people who
have nexuses right across the board.

1479
02:16:35,195 --> 02:16:41,191
If it is true and it turns out
the Memon family are in Pakistan...

1480
02:16:41,502 --> 02:16:45,666
...and your government
agrees that they are there and...

1481
02:16:45,739 --> 02:16:48,207
...there's no denying that,
would you then extradite them?

1482
02:16:49,209 --> 02:16:54,203
First of all as I said, and I
repeat with authority at my command.

1483
02:16:54,348 --> 02:16:56,145
...that these people are
not there in Pakistan.

1484
02:16:56,183 --> 02:16:57,582
They are definitely not there.

1485
02:16:57,751 --> 02:16:59,184
They may not be there
right now, but maybe later...

1486
02:16:59,253 --> 02:17:01,187
...and I can assure you
will not allow them.

1487
02:17:25,579 --> 02:17:28,173
I'm telling you. Besides Tiger...

1488
02:17:28,215 --> 02:17:31,207
Not a single member of the Memon
family was involved with the blasts.

1489
02:17:32,386 --> 02:17:33,410
And Dawood lbrahim?

1490
02:17:43,263 --> 02:17:45,288
Hello.
- Hello.

1491
02:17:45,432 --> 02:17:48,560
Mr. Ram Jethmalani?
- Yes, who's that?

1492
02:17:48,702 --> 02:17:52,263
Sir, Dawood lbrahim here.
- How did you get this number?

1493
02:17:52,406 --> 02:17:54,306
I want to surrender.

1494
02:17:55,275 --> 02:17:59,268
I have done nothing, but
they're blaming me for the blasts.

1495
02:17:59,413 --> 02:18:01,347
What can I do for you?

1496
02:18:01,548 --> 02:18:05,712
I want to give myself
up. On two conditions.

1497
02:18:06,253 --> 02:18:09,222
All pending cases against me...

1498
02:18:09,289 --> 02:18:12,349
besides this one, are to be dropped.

1499
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:16,324
I want bail as
soon as I am arrested.

1500
02:18:16,764 --> 02:18:21,667
I can stay under house
arrest until the trial.

1501
02:18:21,802 --> 02:18:24,293
Tell him that he might
be the king of Dubai.

1502
02:18:24,438 --> 02:18:27,305
But he's not getting any
special Treatment from us.

1503
02:18:31,311 --> 02:18:32,403
I made a mistake!

1504
02:18:45,325 --> 02:18:49,318
Hey stop your boat. Don't move.

1505
02:18:50,497 --> 02:18:52,795
Hand's up or I will shoot!

1506
02:18:53,667 --> 02:18:55,328
Listen!

1507
02:19:01,341 --> 02:19:03,775
Give me your hand.
- Give me your hand.

1508
02:19:06,346 --> 02:19:07,438
Very good.

1509
02:19:16,356 --> 02:19:17,516
Wait.

1510
02:19:18,358 --> 02:19:20,451
Don't kill him.
He'll be the messenger.

1511
02:19:21,695 --> 02:19:23,890
Get all the cargo on the boat.

1512
02:19:24,031 --> 02:19:25,396
Don't you move.

1513
02:19:25,666 --> 02:19:28,931
Keep absolutely still. Lie back.

1514
02:19:29,369 --> 02:19:30,666
Hands to yourself.

1515
02:19:31,371 --> 02:19:32,463
Okay.

1516
02:19:44,351 --> 02:19:46,911
Okay fine.

1517
02:19:58,832 --> 02:20:01,392
Aslam and Jaat
hijacked the entire cargo.

1518
02:20:12,412 --> 02:20:13,504
Hello.

1519
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:15,377
How much did you lose this time?

1520
02:20:16,583 --> 02:20:17,641
Who is this?

1521
02:20:17,751 --> 02:20:21,380
We can get it back for you.

1522
02:20:25,425 --> 02:20:29,361
And we'll make sure that
Aslam Bhatti and Dawood Jaat...

1523
02:20:29,429 --> 02:20:31,522
don't ever get in your way again.

1524
02:20:38,438 --> 02:20:40,998
What do you say to that?

1525
02:20:41,742 --> 02:20:43,471
What will I have to do in return?

1526
02:20:43,877 --> 02:20:46,437
Help us land our
stuff at Shekadi beach.

1527
02:20:46,513 --> 02:20:47,673
Our stuff?
- ISI.

1528
02:20:51,418 --> 02:20:52,510
Will you do it?

1529
02:20:56,456 --> 02:20:57,684
What is it?

1530
02:20:57,891 --> 02:21:00,519
Remember December 6th?
Tehreek-e-inteqam.

1531
02:21:03,563 --> 02:21:04,689
I'll have to think about it.

1532
02:21:06,733 --> 02:21:08,564
Bhai, this just came from home.

1533
02:21:41,935 --> 02:21:45,496
For a brother, who did nothing
to protect his sister's chastity.

1534
02:21:45,639 --> 02:21:50,804
Dawood lbrahim Kaskkar!
- Down with you!

1535
02:21:50,944 --> 02:21:56,678
Dawood lbrahim Kaskkar!
- Down with you!

1536
02:21:56,783 --> 02:22:02,517
Dawood lbrahim Kaskkar!
- Down with you!

1537
02:22:36,556 --> 02:22:41,493
With the cries of 'Jai Shri
Ram' thousands of karsevaks...

1538
02:22:41,561 --> 02:22:47,864
Wielding spears,
hammers and with bare hands...

1539
02:22:48,001 --> 02:22:52,495
Stormed the 450 year
old Babri Masjid...

1540
02:22:52,572 --> 02:22:56,565
...and brought it down.

1541
02:22:56,710 --> 02:22:58,575
They clambered over the barricades.

1542
02:22:58,645 --> 02:23:02,547
They pulled down
obstacles on their way.

1543
02:23:03,650 --> 02:23:06,813
They stoned the walls and
tombs of a structure that...

1544
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:08,888
...has stood for four
and a half centuries.

1545
02:23:09,689 --> 02:23:11,714
Hail Lord Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1546
02:23:11,792 --> 02:23:14,727
464 year-old Babri Masjid
in Ayodhya crumbled down...

1547
02:23:14,861 --> 02:23:17,659
...crumbles under the blows
of thousands of Kar Sevaks.

1548
02:23:17,798 --> 02:23:21,666
It is very sad for all of us.
A matter of great shame...

1549
02:23:21,902 --> 02:23:25,963
For the entire Nation.
That is all I have to say.

1550
02:23:31,044 --> 02:23:34,605
Come on! Shut up!

1551
02:24:02,642 --> 02:24:06,578
24 hours after the Babri Masjid
demolition its effect was felt in...

1552
02:24:06,646 --> 02:24:10,605
...various parts of the country.
Electricity wires were cut.

1553
02:24:10,784 --> 02:24:13,014
Riots spread all around.

1554
02:24:13,186 --> 02:24:15,586
Men were burnt and
butchered inside their homes...

1555
02:24:15,655 --> 02:24:17,680
...in front of their families.

1556
02:24:20,827 --> 02:24:21,953
Tell me.

1557
02:24:22,095 --> 02:24:24,655
There are riots all over
the city. Please come home.

1558
02:24:24,798 --> 02:24:28,234
I know. Fucking bastards.

1559
02:24:28,668 --> 02:24:29,794
Just come back fast.

1560
02:24:29,936 --> 02:24:34,669
Yes love, I have to
finish a few things first...

1561
02:24:34,774 --> 02:24:35,900
Then I'll come home.

1562
02:25:47,747 --> 02:25:50,272
All of Mahim will burn for this!

1563
02:25:53,720 --> 02:25:55,915
Who the fuck had the
balls to touch my office?

1564
02:25:56,056 --> 02:25:59,787
Show yourselves if you dare! I'm
no Tiger unless I make you pay!

1565
02:26:01,761 --> 02:26:03,854
You dare burn MY office!

1566
02:26:09,135 --> 02:26:12,104
Bombay was rocked by
two spells of riots.

1567
02:26:12,205 --> 02:26:17,700
The first in December started
at Mahim with the hoisting of...

1568
02:26:17,777 --> 02:26:20,769
a black flag and took
on inhuman proportions.

1569
02:26:20,914 --> 02:26:25,908
The second round in
January were not spontaneous...

1570
02:26:26,052 --> 02:26:30,045
But organized and
politically motivated.

1571
02:26:30,223 --> 02:26:32,783
The week-long violence
that was unleashed in Bombay...

1572
02:26:32,859 --> 02:26:35,794
...from January 6th, was both
chilling and mind-numbing.

1573
02:26:35,962 --> 02:26:38,795
In an orgy of murder
and blood-letting...

1574
02:26:38,865 --> 02:26:40,799
...over 600 people lost their lives,
thousands were injured...

1575
02:26:40,867 --> 02:26:42,801
...lakhs were rendered homeless.

1576
02:26:43,069 --> 02:26:48,006
Hindus thirsting for Muslim blood
Muslims thirsting for Hindu blood.

1577
02:26:48,241 --> 02:26:51,142
Revenge begets revenge,
begets revenge.

1578
02:26:51,811 --> 02:26:56,748
In both communities,
strident fascism...

1579
02:26:56,783 --> 02:27:01,777
...has risen to the surface.

1580
02:27:02,088 --> 02:27:06,752
The communal
polarization is so deep...

1581
02:27:06,826 --> 02:27:11,263
...that it seems irreversible.

1582
02:27:29,816 --> 02:27:33,809
They killed my father, my
mother and my little brother.

1583
02:27:33,987 --> 02:27:36,114
And I can't find my
grandpa and grandma.

1584
02:27:36,289 --> 02:27:38,314
Thousands of minorities,
the main target...

1585
02:27:38,391 --> 02:27:40,154
...jammed the railway
stations while attempting to flee.

1586
02:27:40,226 --> 02:27:41,284
We are scared.

1587
02:27:41,361 --> 02:27:43,056
The police is the reason.

1588
02:27:43,296 --> 02:27:46,322
We wouldn't run if
the cops are amicable.

1589
02:27:46,466 --> 02:27:48,866
But the cops are hostile towards us.

1590
02:27:49,002 --> 02:27:51,971
They shoot us on sight.
- We're leaving Bombay for good.

1591
02:27:52,038 --> 02:27:53,801
We try to contain the fact that...

1592
02:27:53,873 --> 02:27:56,808
...so much human life and
so much property has...

1593
02:27:56,876 --> 02:28:00,903
...been saved in Bombay, that itself
is a testimony to the kind of effort.

1594
02:28:00,980 --> 02:28:04,347
...which we have put in. - So
that means many more lives and...

1595
02:28:04,417 --> 02:28:06,317
...much more property could
have been destroyed. - Obviously.

1596
02:28:06,453 --> 02:28:10,822
You think 500 is a less... - No, no
that is because of the dedicated...

1597
02:28:10,890 --> 02:28:14,155
...work of the law and
order machinery that...

1598
02:28:14,227 --> 02:28:16,161
...the damage has been
contained to this figure.

1599
02:28:16,329 --> 02:28:19,958
I don't say 500 is a small number.
It is too big a number.

1600
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:24,127
The savagery of the violence drove
away sections of the Hindus as well.

1601
02:28:24,904 --> 02:28:29,307
In pursuit of the single-minded
aim communities were systematically...

1602
02:28:29,442 --> 02:28:32,900
Hounded out of their homes.

1603
02:28:33,046 --> 02:28:36,140
People are asking us to leave.

1604
02:28:36,282 --> 02:28:40,048
They say there is no
place for Muslims here.

1605
02:28:41,888 --> 02:28:44,322
We shouldn't waste any time.

1606
02:28:44,924 --> 02:28:47,017
It would be wise to
leave immediately.

1607
02:28:50,029 --> 02:28:51,963
I'm not going to spare anyone.

1608
02:28:53,933 --> 02:28:56,060
I'll burn all of
Bombay if I have to.

1609
02:29:14,921 --> 02:29:18,357
Our army and our
intelligence are at your disposal.

1610
02:29:18,958 --> 02:29:22,951
You just need to round up the men.

1611
02:29:23,096 --> 02:29:27,533
We'll give you the arms, grenades
and explosives that our army uses.

1612
02:29:27,634 --> 02:29:31,968
The ISI will train your
men in using all of it.

1613
02:29:48,988 --> 02:29:51,923
We should first take out
Thackeray and Advani...

1614
02:29:51,991 --> 02:29:56,485
...so that no one will dare
take us for granted ever again.

1615
02:29:57,030 --> 02:30:00,989
Thackeray is easy to get to.

1616
02:30:02,001 --> 02:30:05,528
We could take him out tomorrow.

1617
02:30:06,673 --> 02:30:08,937
A handshake, a garland
of flowers, and boom.

1618
02:30:09,008 --> 02:30:13,001
Send Thackeray and Advani
on a one way ticket to hell.

1619
02:30:13,146 --> 02:30:15,546
You guys think it's that simple?

1620
02:30:15,982 --> 02:30:19,042
This is no plaything.
- You're setting me a challenge?

1621
02:30:19,285 --> 02:30:24,018
We'll never even get within
sniffing distance of them.

1622
02:30:24,157 --> 02:30:27,024
There are lots of ways. I
don't need to get into details.

1623
02:30:27,293 --> 02:30:31,024
If nothing else works we
buy off the security guy.

1624
02:30:31,164 --> 02:30:32,961
And if even that doesn't
work, wire up a truck...

1625
02:30:33,032 --> 02:30:35,466
and set it off at his home.

1626
02:30:36,202 --> 02:30:39,035
Like those terrorists in Lebanon.

1627
02:30:40,039 --> 02:30:43,031
Bha, can I say something?

1628
02:30:43,176 --> 02:30:44,234
What?

1629
02:30:46,513 --> 02:30:52,315
Knocking off their leaders
won't serve our purpose.

1630
02:30:53,486 --> 02:30:56,046
It won't do our jihad any good.

1631
02:30:57,056 --> 02:31:02,119
You kill them and the
Hindus will turn them into Gods.

1632
02:31:02,362 --> 02:31:04,159
They'll build temples for them.

1633
02:31:06,065 --> 02:31:09,398
It'll become worse for us.

1634
02:31:09,502 --> 02:31:13,063
But we must do something, bring
the whole Hindu race to its knees.

1635
02:31:14,073 --> 02:31:17,236
Why should Muslims
always cower in fear?

1636
02:31:18,344 --> 02:31:23,043
We must do something to make
every Hindu wish that he wasn't one.

1637
02:31:23,216 --> 02:31:28,654
Exactly. Otherwise not a single
Muslim in India will be spared.

1638
02:31:29,088 --> 02:31:33,081
600 million Hindus!
We can't get them all.

1639
02:31:33,226 --> 02:31:35,126
Bha, Bombay.
- What's the idea?

1640
02:31:35,395 --> 02:31:40,230
Bha, Bombay, India's
financial nerve centre.

1641
02:31:40,366 --> 02:31:47,499
Attack Bombay, and the
whole world feels it.

1642
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:51,132
International leaders, the
UN, it'll shake them up.

1643
02:31:52,412 --> 02:31:57,076
The entire system will be
fucked. It'll rattle them.

1644
02:31:57,584 --> 02:32:01,645
And bha, most important thing...

1645
02:32:02,555 --> 02:32:05,388
Show the entire world...

1646
02:32:07,293 --> 02:32:09,557
the strength of Islam.

1647
02:32:10,129 --> 02:32:14,065
I tell you, take down the
Chief Minister's Office...

1648
02:32:14,267 --> 02:32:16,064
Municipal Corporation, the airport...

1649
02:32:16,135 --> 02:32:18,603
knock out all the ministers.

1650
02:32:20,440 --> 02:32:22,704
If Bombay burns...

1651
02:32:23,676 --> 02:32:27,271
the system gets fucked
and they'll crumble...

1652
02:32:28,247 --> 02:32:30,215
the whole economy will crash.

1653
02:32:30,416 --> 02:32:33,579
If we can pull this off bha...

1654
02:32:36,222 --> 02:32:40,522
no one ever again will have the
guts to stare a Muslim in the eye.

1655
02:32:42,328 --> 02:32:44,228
The very thought of a Muslim...

1656
02:32:46,165 --> 02:32:48,531
will make him piss in his dhoti.

1657
02:32:54,574 --> 02:33:00,206
But the whole thing will
take a hell lot of money.

1658
02:33:00,346 --> 02:33:03,713
You are right. But
where's the money...

1659
02:33:06,519 --> 02:33:10,285
going to come from?
- You'll get the money.

1660
02:33:11,190 --> 02:33:12,748
But what do you propose?
