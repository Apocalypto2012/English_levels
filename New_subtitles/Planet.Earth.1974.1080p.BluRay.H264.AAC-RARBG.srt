1
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,113
<i>This is the 22nd century,
the land renewed.</i>

2
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:33,324
<i>The air and water pure again.</i>

3
00:00:34,158 --> 00:00:36,035
<i>The conflicts of the past are gone.</i>

4
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,830
<i>It is a new Earth.
New peoples and new customs.</i>

5
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,583
<i>In some places, bizarre savagery.</i>

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,961
<i>In others, advanced cities.</i>

7
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,838
<i>Everywhere new challenge
and new adventure.</i>

8
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,633
<i>And this is also the story
of Dylan Hunt.</i>

9
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,762
<i>Lost in 1979
in a suspended animation accident.</i>

10
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,642
<i>Over a century and a half later
in the year 2133,</i>

11
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,313
<i>he was found and awakened by
the people of this city called PAX.</i>

12
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,481
<i>Peace.</i>

13
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:08,734
<i>The one place on Earth which
escaped the final conflict</i>

14
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:10,111
<i>of the 20th century.</i>

15
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,031
<i>The one place on Earth
where civilization did not perish.</i>

16
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:16,576
<i>Dylan Hunt is one of them now.</i>

17
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:21,330
<i>Leader of a PAX Science team
exploring a much changed world.</i>

18
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:24,292
<i>Part of the PAX dream
of rebuilding on Earth,</i>

19
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,586
<i>a new and wiser civilization.</i>

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,755
<i>Their mission is mankind.</i>

21
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:31,340
<i>Rebirth of...</i>

22
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:33,092
<i>planet Earth.</i>

23
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,267
Dylan Hunt, log report
to the PAX Council.

24
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:26,604
Per instructions,
we were escorting Pater Kimbridge

25
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,731
on a survey
which has confirmed

26
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,858
that Central California
is now an inland sea.

27
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:34,362
Population along the shore
is a handsome racial mixture.

28
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:36,113
Illiterate but intelligent.

29
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:39,075
Although the land remains fertile,
famine is common.

30
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,202
Their primary need
from us is education

31
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,870
and agricultural techniques.

32
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,414
With those facts determined
we headed homeward

33
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:47,166
<i>when the ambush occurred</i>

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,918
<i>They were Kreegs.</i>

35
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:51,879
<i>That mutated form of human
capable of understanding</i>

36
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,215
<i>only machinery and warfare.</i>

37
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,550
<i>It was clear that
they recognized who we were</i>

38
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:58,052
<i>and wanted us alive.</i>

39
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,553
<i>Possibly because they've heard that</i>

40
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,556
<i>underground subshuttle tubes
honeycomb the earth</i>

41
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:05,059
<i>and that only we of PAX,
know the secret.</i>

42
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,563
<i>Slowing our progress was
the age of Pater Kimbridge,</i>

43
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,065
<i>his rapid exhaustion.</i>

44
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,984
<i>Each of us in turn tried
to divert the Kreeg vehicle</i>

45
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:16,404
<i>while the others moved
Kimbridge nearer and nearer</i>

46
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,448
<i>a subshuttle tube entrance,
where we hoped to escape.</i>

47
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,662
There he is, over there.

48
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,881
Team, switch to XY tranquilizers.

49
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,925
Our standard hypos
aren't stopping them.

50
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,511
Message received,
we're reloading.

51
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:44,974
Isiah, divert them.

52
00:03:57,778 --> 00:03:58,654
Isiah.

53
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:04,660
That thing is from your century?

54
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,370
Yeah, we call them automobiles.

55
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,038
It's fantastic
that it's still running.

56
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:11,792
It's a late 1970s chassis with
a converted wood gas fuel system.

57
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:27,057
There.

58
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,245
No, get the Pater.

59
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:08,182
There.

60
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,150
Dylan, don't.

61
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:32,748
Keep down.

62
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,667
They won't try to take us
alive anymore. Go ahead.

63
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:56,605
Isiah.

64
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,714
Lock it. Hurry.

65
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:36,061
Looks bad.

66
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:38,105
He's alive.

67
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,585
Hurry, it's still here.

68
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,404
Team 21, arriving in four minutes.

69
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,114
You'll have a medical team
standing by?

70
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:30,741
<i>And an operating room.</i>

71
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:33,702
<i>You say you saw signs of
still other Kreegs out there?</i>

72
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:35,162
<i>Perhaps a whole expedition?</i>

73
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:38,332
Affirmative, suggest you cut off
tube power at that point.

74
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,584
We can't get let them
get hold of a subshuttle.

75
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,337
<i>Agreed. Power is terminated.</i>

76
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:01,397
- How is he?
- There's definite heart damage.

77
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:03,816
You can close the medikit now,
I've done all I can with it.

78
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:10,531
And with your mind?

79
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:19,999
Try.

80
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,169
He's slipping away. He's dying.

81
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:25,898
Isiah, please..

82
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:27,441
Ah, let the savage pray.

83
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:30,527
It'll help as much as
anything I can do here.

84
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,735
<i>Concluding log report.</i>

85
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,780
<i>If Kimbridge dies,
the responsibility's mine.</i>

86
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:19,034
And our return to PAX
has made the burden no easier.

87
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,786
<i>To me, Kimbridge is PAX.</i>

88
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,705
<i>Its grace, its warmth,</i>

89
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,250
its dreams of helping Earth
rebuild again.

90
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,004
He is the man who discovered
my body in suspended animation.

91
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:34,383
Whose skill brought me to life again.

92
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,261
Whose wisdom helped me to understand

93
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:40,264
that the best of my own
20th century is not dead.

94
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:45,644
That Earth is still my home,
it's people still my people.

95
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,272
Dylan, Baylok needs you.

96
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:50,190
Pater Kimbridge
is coming out of surgery.

97
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:53,694
Dylan.

98
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,575
How is he?

99
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:01,952
Well, the bullet sheared of a section
of the pulmonary artery.

100
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,412
He can last only a couple of days

101
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,997
without bio-plastic prosthesis.

102
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:07,749
Now, the only surgeon qualified
in that is a Dr. Rabans who--

103
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,668
He's in the eastern
Mediterranean area.

104
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,045
How far is he
from a subshuttle station?

105
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,965
Uh, two weeks at least.
There's a slim second choice.

106
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,925
A Dr. Connor who trained under Rabans.

107
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:17,759
Jonathan?

108
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,137
But he disappeared on a team mission
about a year ago.

109
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,097
We've made attempts
to locate him, of course.

110
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,641
- Where was he last seen?
- Back the way we came,

111
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:26,560
several hundred kilometers further on.

112
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,021
Our equipment's waiting
at the subshuttle.

113
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,032
<i>Log entry 324.</i>

114
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,743
<i>As the first PAX team available,</i>

115
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,870
<i>we are headed for what seems
our best chance</i>

116
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,663
<i>of finding Dr. Connor alive.</i>

117
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:50,417
<i>Hope that the Kreegs are moving
in another direction by now.</i>

118
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,420
<i>Our destination is
an unexplored region out of which</i>

119
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:57,216
<i>have come stories of
a strange Amazon society.</i>

120
00:11:57,382 --> 00:12:00,469
<i>Where males are bought and
sold like captive animals.</i>

121
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:13,357
Women's lib.
Or women's lib gone mad?

122
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:22,282
Officer Smythe,
you call Dr. Connor "Jonathan."

123
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:23,951
How well did you know him?

124
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,079
I mean, did you know anything
not on the tapes

125
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,163
that might be useful to us?

126
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:32,376
He did once mention he'd heard of
some plant mutations in that area.

127
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,962
He was interested
in the medical properties

128
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:37,506
of any new plants,
found after the Great Conflict.

129
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:40,425
That could explain how he got
separated from his team.

130
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:43,595
That's our one hope.

131
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,641
He became separated
and was captured by those women.

132
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:51,311
The tapes list several reports
of men being taken captives.

133
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,939
Hands bound, led by a rope
around the neck.

134
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,817
Pater Kimbridge
has only 60 hours left.

135
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,694
Just finding Jonathan in that time

136
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,487
is once chance in a thousand.

137
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:04,866
There's one way we can
cut those odds a little.

138
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,288
We're going to split the team.

139
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,748
Baylok and Isiah
will take the subshuttle

140
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:14,209
to the old power station
that's listed in the diagrams.

141
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,128
It's near the heart of the area.

142
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,964
Hopefully near a main village
or a town of some sort.

143
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,842
You'll immediately
identify yourselves.

144
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:25,095
Try to explain to them
who and what PAX is.

145
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:27,222
And why they have a lot to gain
and nothing to lose

146
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,473
by co-operating with us.

147
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,686
As you say we will do, my friend,
but, to split the team--

148
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,437
Yes, isn't that--

149
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:37,107
It'll give us two separate
and different shots at our objective.

150
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:39,735
If yours doesn't work, ours might.

151
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:42,455
You'll drop us in part of the way

152
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,156
near a place where
we can pick up some horses.

153
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,700
We'll carry no weapons
and just one transceiver.

154
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:49,578
We'll ride into
the Confederacy of Ruth.

155
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,205
Where you'll tell the first women
that we meet

156
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,333
that you've heard of their
system of female dominance

157
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:55,334
and that you believe in it.

158
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,420
What makes you think
they'll accept that story?

159
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,923
I'll be proof. Your captive,
as described in the tapes.

160
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:06,511
Bound and led in by the neck.

161
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:55,519
You. Have Partha send out
a second team.

162
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,437
I want this field ready tomorrow.

163
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,372
You're on your own HS.

164
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:21,962
Who are you?

165
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:24,172
I've come to join your Confederacy.

166
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:26,341
I brought a male captive
from my country

167
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,301
to prove I agree with your beliefs.

168
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,595
What do you know of the women of Ruth?

169
00:15:31,012 --> 00:15:32,681
I subscribe to your principles.

170
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:35,642
Female dominance is
the natural order of life.

171
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,321
- Eyes down.
- Stop that.

172
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,199
Eyes down.

173
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,628
He hasn't been properly trained.

174
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:06,173
But he looks healthy enough
to bring a good price.

175
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:09,551
I challenge your ownership.

176
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,761
But--but it's obvious that I own him.

177
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:13,889
You saw me ride in with him.

178
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,849
I've just challenged you
for this male.

179
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,350
Will you fight for him or not?

180
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:19,186
But there's no reason to fight.

181
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:20,562
I have come in friendship. I--

182
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,025
He is my property!

183
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:29,488
He was your property.

184
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,975
Uh, there's another man
from my country, miss.

185
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:02,145
Uh, Jonathan Connor.
He came here about a year ago.

186
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,816
I've explained to you,
the rule here is silence.

187
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,904
But, perhaps this friend of mine
and myself can help you.

188
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,322
We can be a value to you.

189
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:15,575
You have men pulling wagons,
ploughing fields.

190
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,995
This friend of mine knows how to train
horses to do it better, faster.

191
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,163
Or even oxen.

192
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,625
Why? You Dinks are
more easily trained.

193
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,002
You take care of yourselves,
you grow your own food.

194
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,963
Why should we bother with animals?

195
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:30,090
That's the second time
you've mentioned training.

196
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:32,259
What kind of training?

197
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,472
We don't geld our males
if that's what worries you.

198
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,891
It would make them too fat and lazy.

199
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,894
But if you break the rule
of silence again,

200
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,146
I'll make an exception in your case.

201
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,501
This way, Dink, follow me.

202
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,259
- Greetings, Marg.
- Fine day, Bronta.

203
00:18:58,803 --> 00:18:59,804
Villar.

204
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,355
Another outsider?
You haven't enough of them, Marg?

205
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:12,108
I'm putting this one up for sale.
His manners are tricky.

206
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,611
Eyes down.

207
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,076
Hands don't show much heavy labor.

208
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,869
That'll affect the price.

209
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,748
Eh, but his lines aren't that bad.

210
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,377
Teeth are good, eyes clear.

211
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:33,254
Couldn't you use a new breeder
at your place?

212
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,888
No spirit.
No, he came along too willingly.

213
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,516
If you can get a breeder price
for him, all the better.

214
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:53,400
Now listen carefully, wherever
you're from, you're a Dink now.

215
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,944
Untrained, but still a Dink.

216
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:57,904
The rules are made simple

217
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,407
so that even a male
can understand them.

218
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:03,284
Show obedience at all times
and you'll find happiness

219
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:04,869
in service to the community.

220
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,372
As long as your behavior warrants it

221
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,583
you'll be protected, fed, clothed,

222
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,585
relieved of all the responsibilities

223
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:15,130
that your sex finds
so difficult in life.

224
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,528
It's a mutant group named Kreegs
and they're dangerous.

225
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,904
Silence.

226
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,699
Look, I'm trying to help you.

227
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,994
Your Confederacy may be attacked
any time now.

228
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,707
This is not a chaotic,
male-dominated society.

229
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,002
We are fully capable
of protecting ourselves.

230
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,601
Remember, you'll keep
eyes down and keep silent.

231
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,270
Look, I must have
the answer to one ques--

232
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,229
Silence!

233
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,565
One question!

234
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,651
And then I'll obey all your rules.

235
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,237
I thought Marg said he had no spirit.

236
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,697
Well?

237
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:26,326
I have a friend who disappeared
in this area about a year ago.

238
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,496
If he's alive and he's here,
I must find him.

239
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:33,792
Is there something about
this particular Dink we'd remember?

240
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,753
Was he unusually large or small?

241
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:37,962
Deformed somehow?

242
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:40,673
No, but his name is Jonathan Connor.

243
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,300
The only name a Dink owns

244
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,260
is the one his mistress
chooses for him.

245
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,930
That is, if she cares
to give him a name at all.

246
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,809
Now, eyes down.

247
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:52,560
And silence.

248
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:08,618
I'm looking for someone--

249
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,120
I have to find an outsider who--

250
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,642
Baylok, Isiah, what happened?

251
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,312
Well, how did you get here?

252
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:40,775
What happened? Tell me.

253
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:43,278
Dylan, please, your voice is angry.

254
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,780
You, on your feet!

255
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,700
C'mon, get on your feet.
Get over there.

256
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,535
I have a buyer interested in you.

257
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:03,798
First sale today.

258
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,843
A team of outsiders recently captured.

259
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,679
You'll find this one well trained.

260
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,141
As powerful a field Dink
as you'll ever see offered.

261
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,852
Examine him as close as you like.

262
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,564
He's a bargain in strength
and stamina.

263
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,025
Look at these shoulders.
Look at these back muscles.

264
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:23,902
Well, if he's as strong as he looks,

265
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:25,028
- I'm interested.
- Wow!

266
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:27,530
- Yeah, I'll bid for him.
- And I.

267
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:28,740
Baylok.

268
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:30,283
- Wait.
- Go away.

269
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,243
What have they done to you?
What's wrong with you?

270
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,496
Listen, look up at me.

271
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,584
Try to look into my eyes.

272
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:45,340
- Look into my eyes.
- Please, don't hurt me.

273
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,383
I won't hurt you.

274
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,802
Try to meet my eyes.

275
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:52,013
Try.

276
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,605
It's your friend, Dylan.

277
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,027
You're an Esper, shut out all of this.

278
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,656
Concentrate on what's inside you.

279
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,784
Your eyes, keep them on mine.

280
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:14,953
Keep them on mine.

281
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,664
It's just the two of us.

282
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,043
Our eyes, our contact.

283
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,422
Dylan...I'm frightened.

284
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:27,674
Why?

285
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:30,969
Have they operated on you in some way?

286
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,596
O-or given you an injection
of some kind?

287
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,933
No. No, nothing medical.

288
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,519
Well, were you given something
to drink then?

289
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,981
No. Water.

290
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,280
Food. Isiah and I...

291
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:57,954
...we both...ate the food.

292
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:02,792
Something, so--something in the food.

293
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,045
Do--don't eat the food.

294
00:25:06,295 --> 00:25:08,423
D-don't eat. It contains something.

295
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,050
Don't, please, go away.

296
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:16,014
Leave me. Frightened.
Drug induces fear.

297
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,850
T-terrible fear. Fear.

298
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,477
Six and six, done.
Can I get six and seven?

299
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:23,354
- Seven.
- Can I get six prime sheep

300
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,272
and seven bushels?

301
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,606
I bid a ram.

302
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:31,738
A ram! Six prime sheep
and eight bushels of grain.

303
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,656
Do I hear nine?

304
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,784
- Kyla.
- No. I won't go that much.

305
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:38,828
Let's see the other one of the pair.

306
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,371
Get him.

307
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:44,375
Nine bushels, Bronta. Remember,
he might have breeder capacity.

308
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,127
If you like 30 pound babies.

309
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,010
Are you certain
he's completely trained?

310
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,391
He's trained.

311
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,143
My bid stands.

312
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,103
That's too high for me.

313
00:26:05,104 --> 00:26:06,522
Sold to Delba.

314
00:26:11,944 --> 00:26:13,696
Another eight bushels for this one?

315
00:26:14,947 --> 00:26:17,158
No, he'd last about two days
in the field.

316
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:19,869
They're up as a pair.
You take both of them or neither.

317
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:23,247
How about that one instead?

318
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:25,917
The outsider?

319
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,127
That's prime breeder stock
if I'm any judge.

320
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:30,213
Yes. I like him.

321
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,760
He'll be offered as breeder stock
tomorrow after training.

322
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,971
All right. I'll take him
and I'll reserve this one.

323
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:41,808
Not so fast, Delba.
I need a breeder too.

324
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,268
He's got spirit.
I may bid for him myself.

325
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,729
I hope training
won't affect him too much.

326
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,690
We'll want him tested, Villar.

327
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,027
- Agreed?
- Agreed, you'll see him tested.

328
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:18,678
Thank you.

329
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,152
I told you that west section
was arable, Merlo.

330
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,195
Then next month, we'll do
even better, mistress.

331
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,406
The door.

332
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,164
An outsider.

333
00:27:50,793 --> 00:27:52,086
I'm lost. I'm trying to--

334
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,546
Go back the way you came.

335
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,924
We want no outsider female ideas
in our Confederacy.

336
00:27:57,633 --> 00:27:59,760
I've seen more hospitality
from savages.

337
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:03,181
What do I have to do? Fight you
just to get simple directions?

338
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,932
That is your right, of course.

339
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,642
You challenge me?

340
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:11,689
Yes.

341
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:16,194
I want some directions.

342
00:28:18,237 --> 00:28:19,864
And I'm damn well gonna get them.

343
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:20,948
Mother!

344
00:28:23,242 --> 00:28:25,244
There, there, there, there. Don't cry.

345
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,163
Mother.

346
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:31,125
I'm sorry. i-I didn't see
the children. I'm sorry.

347
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:36,339
Come by the fire.

348
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:38,633
It must have been cold out there.

349
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:43,387
It's all right.

350
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,020
You see, we're not unkind.

351
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:52,813
Conduct yourself properly

352
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,607
and I'll leave your hands
free tonight.

353
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:56,192
Now, eat.

354
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,320
Eat!

355
00:30:42,381 --> 00:30:43,007
Eat!

356
00:30:54,643 --> 00:30:57,480
I must find him tonight, please.
I can't explain--

357
00:30:57,646 --> 00:30:59,315
There's nothing you can do
until the morning.

358
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:03,235
All new captives must be kept
overnight in the compound.

359
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,323
Do you enjoy the music?

360
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,201
That was my great-great-grandmother's
strike harp.

361
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,499
It's lovely.

362
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,170
Then the other man I described?
Connor?

363
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,381
You can ask about him
in the village tomorrow.

364
00:31:24,256 --> 00:31:26,801
When you challenge Marg
to win back your captive.

365
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:29,220
But why do you have customs like that?

366
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,097
Challenging, fighting.

367
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,641
Because women don't deceive
themselves like men.

368
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,061
Male societies reward
deceit and cowardice.

369
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,938
Here, as in nature,

370
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:42,149
the strong have the best mates
and households.

371
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,319
In nature, the female
is always dominant.

372
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,863
When that natural order is reversed,

373
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,867
men become the same vain,
quarrelsome little seed carriers

374
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:55,913
who lied and postured and drove
the whole world into destruction.

375
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,395
We'll be at full strength
tomorrow sundown,

376
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:20,771
Commander Soldier.

377
00:32:21,313 --> 00:32:22,356
Position units.

378
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:26,068
One to attack each female household.

379
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,156
Their males, they will not fight.

380
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:34,160
No, Commander Soldier,
the woman do something

381
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,745
which make men fear their own shadow.

382
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:40,916
Yes.

383
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,210
Commander Soldier, sir.

384
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,671
Sub-units ready to inspect.

385
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,839
Well...

386
00:33:01,353 --> 00:33:02,354
Have you seen him?

387
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,900
Jonathan Connor? If you worked
here at the village last year

388
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,109
you must have seen him.

389
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:09,987
He's about 35 years old,
5'10" and he--

390
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,906
No, no. No, I've never seen him.

391
00:33:13,365 --> 00:33:14,325
Pretend to be asleep.

392
00:34:15,302 --> 00:34:16,679
- Hmm!
- Quiet, quiet.

393
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,348
- I'm looking for an outsid--
- Back to the compound!

394
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,810
You remember that rule of silence?

395
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,687
It's still in effect.

396
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,647
Not one word.

397
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,983
We're getting some horses

398
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,859
and you're gonna help me
find my friend--

399
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:40,035
There, you look more like one of us
for your challenge tomorrow.

400
00:34:40,202 --> 00:34:41,370
Beautiful, mistress.

401
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:46,125
The Dink extract wasn't always
used on the men here, was it?

402
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,794
In the beginning, it was given
only to troublesome males

403
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,463
but over the years,
our women have begun to depend on it.

404
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,340
It's in a gruel that
Marg delivers everyday

405
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:54,508
to most of the other households.

406
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,469
Which makes it impossible for
anyone to learn Marg's formula.

407
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,055
The secret's been in her family
since our beginning.

408
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:02,641
But by using it so much now,

409
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:05,227
it's slowly destroying
our Confederacy.

410
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,355
Not one household in five
had a child last year.

411
00:35:13,235 --> 00:35:15,279
Pity, he didn't respond
to the extract.

412
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,197
He would have made you a nice profit.

413
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:21,118
Delba wanted him badly
as a breeder. Bronta, too.

414
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,832
Are you certain you saw him
eat the gruel?

415
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:29,793
How long have I been running
this compound, Marg?

416
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:31,712
Do you think I can be tricked?

417
00:35:32,212 --> 00:35:35,257
He tricked me, Villar.
I didn't think he had any spirit.

418
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,055
Delba's right about one thing.

419
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,598
Excellent lines.

420
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,017
None of which changes the law.

421
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,770
He must be trained or exterminated.

422
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:21,947
Please, please, don't hurt me.

423
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,699
Hurt you, little man?

424
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,580
I have more interesting things
in mind for you.

425
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,853
Come out here, Dink.

426
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,027
Eyes down.

427
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:01,612
Damn, your whole--

428
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:03,697
What did you say to me?

429
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:08,452
He's fighting it.

430
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:11,371
More than any we've had
here in quite a while.

431
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:12,748
Yes.

432
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,802
Has Marg's outsider been sold yet?

433
00:38:24,968 --> 00:38:25,677
No, Delba.

434
00:38:25,844 --> 00:38:26,512
Good.

435
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,388
...sold to Carlotta.

436
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,438
Next we have an outsider captive
of exceptional spirit.

437
00:38:37,731 --> 00:38:41,652
His resistance to training
promises a good breeder.

438
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,656
I'm not so sure I'm putting
him up for auction.

439
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:48,867
That's unfair. I've just ridden
all away in to bid on this one.

440
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:51,411
You agreed to auction him,
Marg. Bring him up.

441
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:02,256
Don't be shy, Dink,
you'll get used to it fast enough.

442
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,594
Look at the spirit on this one.

443
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,395
- Are you ready, Delba?
- Yes.

444
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:17,229
Stop.

445
00:39:19,439 --> 00:39:21,191
I'll do any testing that's done.

446
00:39:21,483 --> 00:39:23,485
He's still my property
until he's sold.

447
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,116
Hold on, Villar.

448
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,244
This is Harper-Smythe.
She's here with a challenge.

449
00:39:32,494 --> 00:39:34,329
That Dink is my property.

450
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,207
I captured him and brought him
to the Confederacy.

451
00:39:37,624 --> 00:39:39,877
I challenge any claim you have on him.

452
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,963
You've received
a properly issued challenge, Marg.

453
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,382
Either give up the property or fight.

454
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,719
I'll fight.

455
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:56,476
Harper-Smythe, over there.

456
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,824
Fight, Marg.

457
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,284
You won him fairly.

458
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:59,039
Marg is offering you friendship.

459
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:02,793
We feel no shame here
after we've done our best.

460
00:41:14,596 --> 00:41:17,391
At her age and with his spirit,
we'll have little ones about soon.

461
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:19,518
I'd give half my fields for a baby.

462
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,561
What do you expect of your males?

463
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,232
If you drugged your rams and
stallion, it's the same way.

464
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,193
Are you still peddling
that nonsense, Treece?

465
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:32,489
The human male
is an unstable creature.

466
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:36,159
Who can easily be controlled
by any real woman.

467
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,913
Unless she's afraid
he'll end up by dominating her.

468
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,916
I'd like to see the male
who could dominate me.

469
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:45,877
Perhaps that's exactly
what you'd like.

470
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:47,671
Secretly.

471
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,092
Stand still for your mistress, Dink.

472
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,054
Dylan, it's me. Harper-Smythe.

473
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,890
Everything's all right now.

474
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,601
Come closer, everybody.

475
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,229
Harper-Smythe is looking
for another Dink

476
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,856
who came here about a year ago.

477
00:42:07,774 --> 00:42:10,402
Yes, I'd be interested in buying him.

478
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:13,238
He was a medical healer in my country.

479
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,323
About 34 years old.

480
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:18,910
Brown hair, hazel eyes,
intelligent features.

481
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,372
I've bought most of the outsiders
in the last few years.

482
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,042
You're welcome to come and
look for him at my household.

483
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,504
That's true. Marg does own
most of the outsider Dinks.

484
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,674
And you can easily visit
the other households from there.

485
00:42:33,216 --> 00:42:34,384
Why not stay with me?

486
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,157
Welcome home, mistress.

487
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:11,213
You see the order,
the tranquility of our system?

488
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,800
I certainly think there's some
sense in female dominance.

489
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:16,510
But I don't agree about the drugging.

490
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,513
The extract has its strongest effect
in the beginning.

491
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,808
But as they become accustomed
to it, why, they're content.

492
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,477
Why they're--they're even happy
with it.

493
00:43:26,686 --> 00:43:27,979
The Dink you're looking for?

494
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,274
- You've more in the house?
- Yes.

495
00:43:37,322 --> 00:43:38,448
Perfect contentment.

496
00:43:38,698 --> 00:43:41,785
They take great pride in their work,
their responsibilities.

497
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,424
- Is he here?
- No.

498
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,761
There're many in the fields,
of course. They come at sundown.

499
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,054
Welcome home, mistress.

500
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,056
Another busy day, Gorda?

501
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,268
Thank you.

502
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,854
Not a brain in his head,
but he's a comfort.

503
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,689
I'm sure.

504
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,607
Until yours adjusts to training,

505
00:44:12,774 --> 00:44:15,652
you might find Gorda
much more helpful and amusing.

506
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,281
Oh, no, thank you.

507
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,577
Your room is this way.

508
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,205
Dylan...

509
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:29,457
This way.

510
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,713
<i>Pater Kimbridge is still
not responding to the heart machine.</i>

511
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:39,801
<i>Repeat, Kimbridge critical
with 15 hours of life at most.</i>

512
00:44:40,385 --> 00:44:42,387
<i>Please confirm
your understanding of this.</i>

513
00:44:43,388 --> 00:44:45,307
Fifteen hours, message understood.

514
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:46,975
Team 21 out.

515
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:51,980
Do you understand?
We must find Jonathan.

516
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,984
Must find...Jonathan?

517
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:59,613
Dr. Connor. Pater Kimbridge is dying.

518
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,908
Dylan, you're drugged.
Keep fighting it.

519
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,078
Fighting.

520
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,457
Trying.

521
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:16,838
So much fear.

522
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,554
- Fear of you.
- We mustn't be--

523
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,266
Help.

524
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,518
Help me!

525
00:45:34,689 --> 00:45:35,440
Dylan...

526
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,403
I want to help you.

527
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:44,950
You're frightened you won't please me.

528
00:45:45,116 --> 00:45:46,534
That's how the drug works.

529
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:52,457
See?

530
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,961
You do please me.

531
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,134
Does this help, Dylan?

532
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:05,637
Does this make you less frightened?

533
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:07,722
Yes.

534
00:46:10,725 --> 00:46:13,353
Doesn't this prove there's
nothing to be afraid of?

535
00:46:19,025 --> 00:46:19,901
Help me.

536
00:46:22,737 --> 00:46:25,782
This...this makes you happy?

537
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:29,077
Yes, Dylan.

538
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:49,306
Mm, Dylan, Dylan,
we--we have to find Jonathan.

539
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,273
No, Dylan, no.

540
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:03,862
Jonathan?

541
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:07,949
Jonathan.

542
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,659
Jonathan, do you recognize me?

543
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,036
I'm not drugged.

544
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,205
Who's he?

545
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:16,791
My team leader.

546
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,129
Here's an antidote to Dink extract.

547
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,423
Mix it with water when you
want him to be himself again.

548
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,551
We came here to find you.
You're needed urgently at PAX.

549
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,552
Urgently?

550
00:47:29,387 --> 00:47:33,141
Pater Kimbridge needs heart surgery
in the next 15 hours or he'll die.

551
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:44,861
Drink it all.

552
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:46,946
Or you'll displease your mistress.

553
00:47:49,574 --> 00:47:52,410
The damage to the heart
requires bio-plastic surgery.

554
00:47:52,577 --> 00:47:54,579
- Dr. Rabans?
- Can't be reached in time.

555
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:57,415
If you could just escape
to the subshuttle station...

556
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,335
Marg would miss me immediately.
I'm due in the cooking shed.

557
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,254
After she bought me, I was put to work

558
00:48:03,421 --> 00:48:04,964
where she makes the Dink extract.

559
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,010
Even drugged, I could recognize
simple distilling equipment.

560
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:12,472
And once I recognized the process,
I avoided eating the gruel

561
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,140
until my mind began clearing.

562
00:48:14,557 --> 00:48:16,810
Who--who are you?

563
00:48:16,976 --> 00:48:18,061
You'll be all right in a minute.

564
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:23,400
The extract is from a mutated plant

565
00:48:23,566 --> 00:48:25,443
which produces
a fear fascination syndrome

566
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,736
on the central nervous system.

567
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,744
The antidote was
easy since it's similar

568
00:48:29,768 --> 00:48:31,866
to compounds isolated in the 1960s

569
00:48:32,033 --> 00:48:33,618
in biochemical warfare labs.

570
00:48:33,993 --> 00:48:35,161
You're Dr. Connor.

571
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,621
Yes, it's Jonathan.

572
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,206
You've been drugged.

573
00:48:38,873 --> 00:48:39,541
I know.

574
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:42,502
- You gave me something?
- An antidote.

575
00:48:44,045 --> 00:48:46,005
Listen, we've got to get you
back to PAX.

576
00:48:46,172 --> 00:48:48,925
I know about Kimbridge.
But there's no way I can leave now.

577
00:48:50,885 --> 00:48:52,387
Or maybe there is one way.

578
00:48:53,012 --> 00:48:55,932
Harper, you must tell Marg that
you want to trade him for me.

579
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,977
She wants him.
Everyone in the household knows it.

580
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,229
Maybe we ought to tell him
what she wants him for.

581
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,273
I know, I remember parts
of what happened.

582
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:04,649
Parts?

583
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,651
Marg, usually oversees
the gruel shipments

584
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:07,861
to the other households.

585
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,612
If you can get her distracted
from that

586
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:10,905
she won't notice I'm gone.

587
00:49:11,197 --> 00:49:12,407
- I'll try.
- Good.

588
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:18,621
This Dink may just have
a surprise for her.

589
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,459
Get her occupied and
I'll leave with Harper.

590
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:25,253
As a woman, she can take me
anywhere without questions.

591
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,672
What in the devil kept you here
if you weren't drugged?

592
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,300
I've been accumulating
a supply of the antidote.

593
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:33,761
Waiting for a chance to get it into
the gruel they send out from here.

594
00:49:34,053 --> 00:49:36,723
In that way, it would reach Dinks
in almost every household.

595
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,433
Do it. I mean, on your way out.

596
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,934
With her help, it oughta be easy.

597
00:49:40,518 --> 00:49:42,312
Tell PAX that I'll look
for Baylok and Isiah and--

598
00:49:50,361 --> 00:49:51,154
Marg.

599
00:49:52,238 --> 00:49:53,865
What are you doing in here?

600
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,575
He's the one I was looking for.

601
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:56,534
This one?

602
00:49:56,826 --> 00:49:58,620
I saw him from the window
and called him in.

603
00:50:00,955 --> 00:50:03,333
Yes, he is a handsome devil, isn't he?

604
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,126
I paid quite a price for him.

605
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:06,920
I'm sure.

606
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,341
I wonder, could we make an exchange?

607
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,810
That is if mine interests you at all.

608
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,234
Well, it would hardly be
an even exchange.

609
00:50:29,692 --> 00:50:31,444
Mine's extremely well trained.

610
00:50:33,446 --> 00:50:35,240
But you are my guest, so I agree.

611
00:50:35,406 --> 00:50:37,742
You're very generous, Marg. Thank you.

612
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,870
Dylan, you're to go
with the household mistress.

613
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,288
You belong to her now.

614
00:50:53,758 --> 00:50:56,010
- You handled that well, Harper.
- You think he'll be all right?

615
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,470
Marg can be dangerous.

616
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:00,932
It probably depends on how well
he understands female psychology.

617
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:04,352
I don't think he knows
the first thing about it.

618
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:05,895
Perhaps.

619
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:08,940
But you can never be sure
about us Dinks.

620
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,366
- Excellent, Gorda.
- Thank you, mistress.

621
00:51:30,753 --> 00:51:33,673
Does the mistress wish something
done with this ugly one?

622
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,931
No, I may want him after I see
the gruel wagons loaded.

623
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:54,485
Get up!

624
00:51:55,236 --> 00:51:56,779
How dare you sit with me.

625
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,782
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, mistress.

626
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:02,785
I--I'm--I'm so used to sitting
with my wives when they take--

627
00:52:02,952 --> 00:52:06,289
Silence!
You've had no permission to speak.

628
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,498
Yes, mistress.

629
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:13,921
You said wives.

630
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,966
Did you have several wives
at the same time?

631
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,052
I only had 14.

632
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:20,762
Some had more.

633
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,263
Fourteen?

634
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:27,060
Huh! Well, you must've used
them for many duties.

635
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,813
- Cooking, weaving, field work?
- No, no, mistress.

636
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,859
Our wives are used only
to please us and to bare children.

637
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,239
Gorda, you're being a nuisance.

638
00:52:40,823 --> 00:52:42,825
Get out! All of you, get out!

639
00:52:54,253 --> 00:52:55,922
Typical male vanity.

640
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,015
Fourteen wives is totally ridiculous.

641
00:53:13,898 --> 00:53:17,819
A male hasn't lived who could
properly see to just one of us.

642
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:24,283
Well, you found that
to be true, didn't you?

643
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,288
I've had 41 children in
the last five years, mistress.

644
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,666
You're lying.

645
00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:39,006
The male creature is unable
to produce children in those numbers.

646
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,175
Your bodies as feeble
as your intellect

647
00:53:41,342 --> 00:53:42,760
and just as unreliable.

648
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,053
But, mistress,

649
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:48,349
the males in my country
are trained from childhood

650
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:52,812
in certain practices
which...make us different.

651
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,613
Practices?

652
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:04,866
What are they? Show me.

653
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,201
Oh, well...

654
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,038
Well, first, I need strength.

655
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,127
And then, of course,
we would require a quiet place.

656
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,259
Gorda.

657
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:24,886
Gorda!

658
00:54:27,972 --> 00:54:28,723
Yes, mistress?

659
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,433
Have this food brought upstairs.

660
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,311
And tell Partha
that he'll be responsible

661
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,771
for the gruel shipments today.

662
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:36,606
Come.

663
00:54:42,111 --> 00:54:44,655
Four pots.
Ship to the village later today.

664
00:54:46,407 --> 00:54:49,243
Gorda, have you seen your mistress?

665
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,287
She is upstairs
and has asked for wine.

666
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,373
- May I hurry there, please?
- And the outsider who--

667
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,376
He is with her, mistress.
May I hurry, please?

668
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:58,503
All right.

669
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,089
Wine, does that mean anything?

670
00:55:02,673 --> 00:55:05,301
It's kept for guests, mainly,
Marg rarely takes any.

671
00:55:05,968 --> 00:55:07,553
They're almost finished making
the gruel.

672
00:55:18,147 --> 00:55:19,857
Mm, it's the proper color.

673
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,239
Well, get out.

674
00:55:31,702 --> 00:55:32,495
Out!

675
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,008
You've tricked me before.

676
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,262
If you're lying about
any part of this...

677
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,891
Eat! Stop dawdling over your food.

678
00:56:08,489 --> 00:56:09,615
Mm, good.

679
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,534
Wine is necessary?

680
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:15,663
A proper wine is most important
to the ritual, mistress.

681
00:56:17,623 --> 00:56:19,292
'Course this isn't exactly
the right kind--

682
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:21,127
No, please don't.

683
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,048
It's all right, Dink.
I just wanted to sure of something.

684
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,050
Get up and eat.

685
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,308
You frighten me, mistress.

686
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,728
Nothing will work if I'm frightened.

687
00:56:39,186 --> 00:56:41,731
I'm not angry with you.

688
00:56:42,773 --> 00:56:43,691
See?

689
00:56:44,775 --> 00:56:49,155
I'm quite...pleased with you.

690
00:56:51,365 --> 00:56:54,285
While you're in my quarters,
you may take certain liberties.

691
00:56:55,953 --> 00:56:57,914
You are permitted to look up at me.

692
00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,790
To speak freely.

693
00:56:59,957 --> 00:57:02,543
And...touch you as necessary?

694
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,754
Of course you can touch me.

695
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:08,049
Just why do you think you're here?

696
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:11,677
All right.

697
00:57:14,513 --> 00:57:15,264
Now we begin.

698
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,686
- This will be for you.
- I don't care for any wine.

699
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:24,523
Oh, but this is necessary, mistress.

700
00:57:25,524 --> 00:57:29,236
We must... join
in chemical conditioning.

701
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:30,738
Conditioning?

702
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,823
Oh, you must drink it, mistress.

703
00:57:33,866 --> 00:57:38,412
My body has been trained
from childhood to be excited

704
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:41,999
by the action of wine
on your biochemical structure.

705
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:50,257
All of it, mistress.

706
00:58:00,893 --> 00:58:04,021
Our chemical configurations
must balance.

707
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:06,649
Now...

708
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,362
The first test.

709
00:58:25,876 --> 00:58:26,877
That's strange.

710
00:58:27,878 --> 00:58:29,797
I should feel our balance beginning.

711
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,550
Do you feel any balance yet?

712
00:58:34,176 --> 00:58:35,428
I seem to feel something.

713
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,776
I definitely feel something.

714
00:58:50,943 --> 00:58:52,528
Yes, it's beginning.

715
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,657
But it's only a shadow
of what it should be.

716
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:01,537
We'll need a...second assimilation.

717
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,921
All of it, mistress.

718
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,924
Balance is critical at this point.

719
00:59:27,646 --> 00:59:29,356
The entire place could be cleaner.

720
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,257
How long has it been
since the equipment

721
00:59:31,281 --> 00:59:32,651
had a thorough going-over?

722
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,404
And I've other complaints, too.

723
00:59:36,363 --> 00:59:38,157
The fires are built wastefully,

724
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:41,243
requiring too much fuel
for too little heat.

725
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,497
The gruel is far too thin.

726
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:48,209
Altogether, you've been careless
in a number of things.

727
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,419
But I'm sure you'll try harder now.

728
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:53,464
I'll say nothing of this
to the household mistress.

729
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:54,799
Just this once.

730
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,512
- Partha.
- Yes, mistress.

731
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:01,180
I need some exercise.

732
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:02,348
He'll ride with me.

733
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:04,183
Two horses.

734
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:19,740
You...promised...we'd be balanced.

735
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:24,453
I know I'm balanced
because I feel balanced.

736
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,539
Perfectly, perfectly!

737
01:00:26,705 --> 01:00:28,415
Perfectly? Not quite.

738
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:35,297
Our bio...our bio...you-know-what's
are nearly there, pussycat.

739
01:00:38,175 --> 01:00:41,512
See here, Dink. You may not call me...

740
01:00:44,014 --> 01:00:45,182
What did you call me?

741
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:48,144
Pussycat

742
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,775
Pussycat.

743
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:59,155
You don't talk like
a proper Dink-Dink.

744
01:00:59,363 --> 01:01:04,785
You certainly don't act like
a proper Dink-Dink.

745
01:01:05,619 --> 01:01:07,413
Dink, Dink.

746
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:09,748
Dink.

747
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,960
What shall I name you?

748
01:01:14,211 --> 01:01:15,296
Already got a name.

749
01:01:16,338 --> 01:01:17,506
Say hello to Rip.

750
01:01:18,465 --> 01:01:19,175
Rip?

751
01:01:20,217 --> 01:01:21,886
Rip Van Winkle.

752
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:28,601
Born February 3, 1944, Fire Creek,
Colorado, in the good old US of A.

753
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:30,519
Colorado?

754
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:33,856
Mm-hmm.
What do you think of that, my girl?

755
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:43,824
I know I'm balanced.
Why aren't you balanced?

756
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:49,580
Well, it...because it takes a while
at my age.

757
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:54,126
Born 1944, that makes me
189 years old.

758
01:01:57,129 --> 01:01:58,214
How 'bout that?

759
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,382
Marg of the Confederacy

760
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:05,596
trapped in the clutches of
a 20th century male chauvinist pig.

761
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,309
Mm. Who's willing to admit

762
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:16,982
that females in charge is no more
upside-down than our system was.

763
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:21,278
Women's lib. Men's lib.

764
01:02:22,529 --> 01:02:24,865
What do you say
we dump 'em both, Marg?

765
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:27,409
People's lib.

766
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,412
Are you for people's lib?

767
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,665
I'm for balance!

768
01:02:37,002 --> 01:02:37,962
Please.

769
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:40,714
Please.

770
01:02:42,132 --> 01:02:43,550
What a lovely word.

771
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,014
Please.

772
01:02:54,186 --> 01:02:56,313
I don't think we need
any more of this, Marg.

773
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:58,274
We're there.

774
01:02:59,733 --> 01:03:01,151
No more words.

775
01:03:02,194 --> 01:03:06,323
I think we're ready for
a little nonverbal mutual...

776
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:09,451
respect.

777
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:46,905
Marg, it's Kreegs!

778
01:03:52,202 --> 01:03:52,995
Get out of here!

779
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:54,621
Outside!

780
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,499
I am going.

781
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,543
You, come!

782
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,003
Pardon me.

783
01:04:31,283 --> 01:04:31,992
Shoot him!

784
01:04:33,827 --> 01:04:34,495
Partha!

785
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:37,664
What are you doing?

786
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:39,416
You're being foolish.

787
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,794
I'll give you all the food
you can carry.

788
01:04:42,252 --> 01:04:44,088
Just leave this household as it is

789
01:04:44,254 --> 01:04:47,424
and I will be able to continue
to supply you any time you come here.

790
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:49,968
Yes. Your land very rich.

791
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,013
We want the secret.

792
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:54,556
Secret?

793
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:58,435
Yes. How you turn men
into frightened rabbits.

794
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:02,106
You offer farm goods
when you have that?

795
01:05:07,152 --> 01:05:09,571
Gorda.
Did everyone get the gruel last night?

796
01:05:09,738 --> 01:05:10,739
- What?
- The gruel!

797
01:05:10,906 --> 01:05:13,450
- Did all the Dinks eat the gruel?
- Stop that!

798
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:16,787
Yeah, I guess they did.

799
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:17,996
Come on.

800
01:05:18,997 --> 01:05:20,874
I tell you, there is no secret.

801
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:21,750
You lie!

802
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:22,835
Move!

803
01:05:23,752 --> 01:05:25,671
- Move!
- There is no secret!

804
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:30,092
Our males know life is pleasant here,
their needs are cared for.

805
01:05:32,928 --> 01:05:34,972
You lie to a manly soldier!

806
01:05:37,015 --> 01:05:38,016
Now tell!

807
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:41,270
Why do wagons come here each day?

808
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:44,940
From here, what do they take?

809
01:05:53,198 --> 01:05:54,533
You do not fear me.

810
01:05:54,783 --> 01:05:55,659
Soldiers.

811
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:58,829
Bring other female.

812
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:01,373
What can we do?

813
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:03,667
Do?

814
01:06:04,793 --> 01:06:06,044
There are only six of them.

815
01:06:07,504 --> 01:06:09,047
Look how many there are of us.

816
01:06:13,677 --> 01:06:15,762
This female has also lied.

817
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,193
I'm sorry.

818
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:31,737
I hoped you'd seen them and escaped.

819
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,699
We show reason to fear.

820
01:06:53,425 --> 01:06:55,052
Fight! Fight or they'll kill you!

821
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:22,037
Well, come on!

822
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:26,602
Careful, my friend.

823
01:08:29,187 --> 01:08:29,771
Harper!

824
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:32,983
Harper! Are you all right?

825
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,453
You were doing very well
without our help.

826
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,079
Marg, are you sure you're all right?

827
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:48,206
They fought for me.

828
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:50,626
My Dinks fought for me.

829
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,419
Because they're no longer drugged.

830
01:08:52,794 --> 01:08:54,254
We'd all be dead if they were.

831
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:56,057
Know every household
has fought like this.

832
01:08:56,081 --> 01:08:57,716
It's happened over
the entire Confederacy.

833
01:08:58,258 --> 01:09:01,553
Connor, we need you. I just spoke
to Pax, Kimbridge is hanging on.

834
01:09:02,387 --> 01:09:04,306
We almost made it to the subshuttle
last night.

835
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,892
Well, there's still a chance if we can
make the subshuttle fast enough.

836
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,394
Gorda, we need two fast horses!

837
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:10,854
You can use the medikit here.

838
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:19,237
Here are 200 horses!

839
01:09:19,821 --> 01:09:22,949
Come on! Connor,
Baylok, Isiah, get in!

840
01:09:25,994 --> 01:09:28,038
HS, help with the injured,
I'll be back for you.

841
01:09:40,842 --> 01:09:41,843
It's agreed, then?

842
01:09:42,594 --> 01:09:45,972
All our households will try it
without the extract?

843
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,057
Agreed.

844
01:09:48,016 --> 01:09:48,600
Agreed.

845
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:49,559
Agreed.

846
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:51,353
But it won't be the same.

847
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:54,898
Imagine a household
with undrugged males underfoot.

848
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:56,817
Chattering, making mischief.

849
01:09:56,983 --> 01:09:58,193
And children, perhaps.

850
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,953
It's true, Isiah, there were
millions of cars in my century.

851
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,287
All over the world.

852
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:25,929
HS.

853
01:10:26,638 --> 01:10:27,389
Any word yet?

854
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:30,892
Yes, I just received a message that
Jonathan reached surgery in time.

855
01:10:31,351 --> 01:10:33,186
- And the Pater will be all right?
- Yes.

856
01:10:33,353 --> 01:10:34,479
Oh, that's good news.

857
01:10:35,188 --> 01:10:36,565
For you, friend.

858
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:40,569
No thanks, tiger.
So you'll be staying on?

859
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:49,077
I'm almost sorry
I can't stay on, Marg.

860
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:50,662
I'm not.

861
01:10:51,496 --> 01:10:54,166
You're the worst of everything
that's vile in the male species.

862
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,253
She laughed at me
when I told her about the 14 wives.

863
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:00,213
Your 41 children.

864
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,258
Your...secret ritual.

865
01:11:04,384 --> 01:11:07,596
I've never felt so demeaned,
so insulted, so--

866
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:08,430
Hungover?

867
01:11:16,938 --> 01:11:18,064
Come back, Dylan Hunt.

868
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:20,525
On equal terms?

869
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,904
On balanced terms.

870
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:30,118
- Men.
- They have their place.

871
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:55,811
Here's Dylan now.

872
01:11:56,978 --> 01:11:58,980
Pater, it's good to see you
looking so well again.

873
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:01,066
He'll be running with our young people
in a few weeks.

874
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:07,239
Harper-Smythe tells me you've had some
most unusual experiences.

875
01:12:07,572 --> 01:12:10,575
Oh, yes, Pater. Did she mention that
I was her Dink for a while?

876
01:12:11,034 --> 01:12:12,536
As a matter of fact, she didn't.

877
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:16,289
I don't think we should tire the Pater
with too many stories.

878
01:12:16,456 --> 01:12:19,125
Oh, I want to know.
It sounds very interesting.

879
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:24,381
No, actually not. Dylan was drugged,
he hardly knew what was going on.

880
01:12:25,173 --> 01:12:27,926
Actually, most of it's
beginning to come back to me, HS.

881
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:33,098
Oh, except the part with you,
that's a total blank.

882
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:35,350
Were you a good mistress??

883
01:12:36,017 --> 01:12:38,311
Not nearly as good as Marg, I'm sure.

884
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:39,771
Marg?

885
01:12:43,149 --> 01:12:45,735
I don't think we should tire
the Pater with too many stories.

886
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:54,995
<i>The 22nd century,</i>

887
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:56,830
<i>a reborn planet Earth,</i>

888
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:59,165
<i>a thousand new adventures.</i>

889
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,293
<i>This has been one of them.</i>
