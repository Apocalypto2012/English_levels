00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,461
DECEMBER, 1999
GEUMO CITY

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,051
-Wow.
-Wow.

3
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,344
The hero of Geumo Police.

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,554
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,098
You caught the guy before the MIU did,
so that makes you a hero.

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,058
Don't get cute with me, man.

7
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:22,063
He was acting all high and mighty
when he first came down

8
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,190
to catch that escaped prisoner
but ended up getting schooled by Taekrok.

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,570
By the way, I heard that guy is
just as crazy as you are.

10
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,822
-Maybe we should pit him against you.
-What?

11
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:33,199
You know.
That's why we call you Taek the Dog.

12
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,119
Didn't you know?

13
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,954
-Everybody calls you that.
-Taek the Dog.

14
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,507
We caught the guy
without much trouble thanks to you.

15
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,260
You should do a little sightseeing
while you're here.

16
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,764
It must've been a hassle dealing with us.

17
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,057
Well, not really.

18
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,978
It happens often with the MIU
since we travel all around the country

19
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,105
and stick our noses
into the cases of the local cops.

20
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,523
I guess so.

21
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,694
I won't beat around the bush.

22
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,030
I very much like the way you investigate.

23
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,741
Would you like to work with me
by any chance?

24
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,370
Think about it.

25
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:40,683
OCTOBER 2000
SEOUL

26
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,402
Hey!

27
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,821
Stand back!

28
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,114
-Put the knife down!
-Drop it!

29
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,157
Stay back, you fucking pigs!

30
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,158
Drop it!

31
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,618
Hey! Fuck!

32
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,829
Put the knife down!
He has a hostage. Stay back!

33
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,164
-Don't come closer!
-You bastards!

34
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,041
-Get lost, fuckers!
-Hey!

35
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,043
Please help me!

36
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,795
-You sons of bitches!
-Put our weapons down!

37
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,380
Please save me.

38
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,257
Let's calm down and talk about this.

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,362
SHADOW DETECTIVE SEASON 2

40
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,157
Dohyung shot his gun again.

41
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,421
I created BST with members from the MIU.

42
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,215
Let's be safe today too.

43
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,886
We never know when or how we'll get hurt…

44
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,012
That guy.

45
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,223
He held a university student hostage
and slit her throat before.

46
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,601
If Squad Chief Choi hadn't shot him,

47
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,644
the same thing could
have happened to that girl.

48
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:11,900
So why the hell do we even have to worry
about getting punished for using guns?

49
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:15,153
Calm down. The disciplinary action will
just be a pay cut if I get one at all.

50
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,487
It's fine. I'll take care of it.

51
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,782
Right. Let's stop worrying tonight
and just drink away, okay?

52
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,703
-Be safe!
-Today too!

53
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,788
Come up with something else.
It's always the same...

54
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,042
Come on. What else could be
more important to us than this?

55
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,376
Right. Dohyung.

56
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,087
I've been thinking about this for a while.

57
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,132
What if we form a group? Just us guys.

58
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,218
BST, for Be Safe Today too.

59
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,429
BST. What do you think?

60
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,598
-That sounds so lame.
-It's nice.

61
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,225
-Good, right?
-I like it.

62
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,393
Be Safe Today too.
It's good, don't you think?

63
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,647
-I like it. It's decided, then.
-Let's do it!

64
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,315
-BST!
-Good? Good!

65
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,900
All right. Be safe!

66
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,401
Today too!

67
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:00,907
Hey, Jinseok.

68
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,124
What is it?

69
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:14,963
What's this?

70
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,967
For your mother's surgery.
We all pitched in a little.

71
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,844
I know you all don't get paid much.
I can't accept this.

72
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,513
Hey, kid, I ought to…

73
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,057
We're supposed to help each other
when in need. Take it.

74
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,185
Take it.

75
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,941
Thanks, Taekrok.

76
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,778
BST

77
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,488
You and your obsession with BST…

78
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,531
What? It's nice.

79
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,701
Be safe today too.

80
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:04,262
Maybe the situation got serious
because the guy he shot sued him.

81
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,103
HOMICIDE TEAM 2

82
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,815
Squad Chief Choi
got suspended for three months.

83
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,568
What the hell? That isn't right!

84
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,445
For fuck's sake, that's too harsh.

85
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,447
Those damn higher-ups.

86
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,656
Hey, man.

87
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,993
Taekrok, are we just supposed
to sit back and watch?

88
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,055
Dohyung received a three-month suspension.

89
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,689
NOEUL GOSIWON

90
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,117
Should I proceed…

91
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,370
with Kim Taekrok?

92
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,875
All right.

93
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,629
Kill it.

94
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,531
In order to protect ourselves…

95
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,117
In order to protect ourselves
we should help each other.

96
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,828
…we should help each other.

97
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:04,966
We're ready.

98
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,612
LEE SEONGA

99
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,494
Listen carefully.

100
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,205
This is very important.

101
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,641
DETECTIVE KIM TAEKROK

102
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,483
DETECTIVE KIM TAEKROK

103
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,534
Goodness, Detective Kim.

104
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,579
To what do I owe the pleasure of you
calling me at this hour?

105
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,290
You sound at ease.

106
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,875
I don't think you should be.

107
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,337
I'm not sure what you mean…

108
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,714
Ah...

109
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,466
I heard Seo Gwangsu turned himself in

110
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,555
and made some ridiculous accusation
about me working for Lee Youngho.

111
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,848
Did you put him up to it?

112
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,518
Do I take it you aren't concerned
since Won Jaegu has your back?

113
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,813
Think however you will.

114
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,440
How much longer do you think
you can get away with this?

115
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,193
By the way, Detective Kim.

116
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,987
Be careful.

117
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,447
That might get you into big trouble.

118
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,074
You're the one who should be careful.

119
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,830
I've seen plenty of guys like you get
stabbed in the back for trusting people.

120
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,583
What is it?

121
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,876
Are you any different
from Team Leader Han?

122
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,336
Aren't you the reason

123
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,590
Team Leader Han ended up like that?

124
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,469
Tell Choi Dohyung.

125
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,888
You.

126
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,890
The Geumjeong Society.

127
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,104
I'll be ending it all.

128
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,746
Kim Taekrok left this behind.

EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
PETITIONER: KIM TAEKROK

"Squad Chief Choi Dohyung is
a police officer of great dedication,

132
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,398
who always puts the safety
of his team members and civilians first."

133
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,275
Come on, stop reading that. Jeez.

134
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,778
Give it here. It's just that I'm touched.

135
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,489
You're doing this on purpose, right?
Stop messing with me.

136
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,532
I'm just thankful, that's all.

137
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,743
I didn't get disciplinary action
thanks to you.

138
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,205
How did you manage to get over 100 people
to sign on such short notice?

139
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,624
It wasn't me.
It was the boys who did everything.

140
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:12,380
By the way, you might have
gotten on the bad side of the higher-ups.

141
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,382
Aren't you worried?

142
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,633
I don't care.

143
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:19,762
-Kim Taekrok!
-Kim Taekrok!

144

-Kim Taekrok!
-Kim Taekrok!

145
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,145
Thanks to Taekrok,
we're all safe again today. All of us BST!

146
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,314
Didn't you say the name was corny?

147
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,357
When did I say that?

148
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,025
How about we all go for a drink tonight?

149
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:33,943
-Yes.
-Sounds good.

150
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,570
All right, let's go.
Barbecue on me. Prime beef.

151

-Who are you?

-Is Detective Lee Seonga not here?
-What is this about?

159
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,165
Seonga, someone's here for you.

160
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,624
I'm Lee Seonga.

161
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,921
We're from the provincial police agency.

162
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,549
You're going to have to come with us.

163
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,217
For what?

164
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,095
We're investigating
the murder of Woo Jangik

165
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,431
and Team Leader Han Giyong's suicide.

166
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,185
-Who are you people?
-What am I being investigated for?

167
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,195
There's proof that you had been
following Team Leader Han Giyong

168
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,405
at the time of his disappearance.

169
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,662
-Still, this is too sudden.
-This isn't right.

170
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,372
You should follow protocol.

171
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,082
-You know that.
-What are you doing?

172
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,172
Cooperate.

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,176
As of today,

00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,887
Chief, what do you mean...

175
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,055
Be quiet!

176
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,099
Detective Lee will be investigated
following protocol.

177
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,017
But Chief--

178
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,101
Also,

179
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,730
you'll be appointed to another department,
Detective Son Gyeongchan.

180
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,357
That is all.

181
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,988
Chief Baek,
you can't just disband a team like that.

182
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,657
-Please…
-Listen carefully.

183
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,285
Choi Dohyung will be
going after you with full force.

184
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,289
We knew this would happen.

185
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,353
What on earth are you doing?

186
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,063
You've been ordered to stop
all internal investigations.

187
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,066
I told you to return to headquarters
as soon as you recover.

188
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,866
Detective Kim Taekrok told me

189
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,077
that I should have taken on
the responsibility myself.

190
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,623
You stop here…

191
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,960
and go back to your post.

192
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,714
I can't do that.

193
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,049
That is what your father
would want for you.

194
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,345
What I want…

195
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,558
is to prove that my father
didn't die from a car accident,

196
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,312
but that he was murdered

197
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,814
by the Geumjeong Society.

198
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:04,361
POLLING BOOTH

199
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,823
BALLOT BOX

200
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:15,664
With turnout for the
local election at 18 percent as of noon,

201
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,416
it already seems quite certain

202
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,586
that Candidate Kim Jinsun
will win the election.

203
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:25,007
Director Choi Dohyung
voted alongside Candidate Kim Jinsun

204
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,636
and urged citizens
to actively vote for the community.

205
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,722
Meanwhile, the campaign headquarters
of the Future Freedom Party

206
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:35,434
and the Upright Country Party
seem to be at odds with each other

207
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,353
while citizens continue
to visit voting booths...

208
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,065
-Taekrok.
-...to cast their precious votes.

209
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,823
OCTOBER 2003

210
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,242
You jerks. Do you take me for a joke?

211
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,787
If I tell you to do something, you do it.
You don't get any say in it!

212
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,914
The operation getting canceled
doesn't make any sense.

213
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,165
It's been postponed, not canceled.

214
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,084
If we miss our chance today,
we won't catch that drug ring.

215
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,252
Are you under pressure
from the prosecution again?

216
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,504
What did you say?

217
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,090
Cops aren't lackeys to the prosecutors!

218
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,051
You asshole. Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

219
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,186
This is the shitty reality
Korea's police officers have to face.

220
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,106
Powerless against those above and below.

221
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,774
What do we do now?

222
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,900
How did it go?

223
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,029
What if they catch onto us and run?

224
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:30,781
Tonight,

225
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,201
we'll give them a quick raid
with just a few of us BST guys.

226
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,663
That's right.
What are they gonna do if we catch them?

227
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,747
Let them go?

228
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,167
You're right. Let's go.

229
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,419
Yes, let's go.

230
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,222
-Jinseok.
-Yes?

231
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,392
-Make sure Dohyung doesn't use his gun.
-Okay.

232
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,102
What did you just say?

233
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,563
We're out here without approval.

234
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,816
If you want to get punished
and have me as your boss,

235
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,443
then be my guest and shoot away.

236
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,737
You brat. Stop talking nonsense.

237
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,197
That's my head…

238
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,158
Over there, they're coming.

239
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,790
-Get ready.
-Hey, get ready.

240
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,008
Go in.

241
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,640
You bastards!

242
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,575
That bastard…

243
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,002
What the hell? I told you not to use it!

244
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,796
-Step aside!
-You punk.

245
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,131
-Stop.
-Let go, damn it!

246
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,674
Step aside!

247
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,306
Fuck!

248
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,475
Hey!

249
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,072
I'll go around!

250
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,912
I heard from an old colleague

251
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,165
that Kim Taekrok came to see him.

252
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,294
It seems like
he's visiting old BST members.

253
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,920
I'll look into that.

254
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,423
The party welcome assembly is in two days.

255
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,384
Make sure you take care of it quietly.

256
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,719
Yes, sir.

257
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,169
Who are you? I don't recognize your face.

258
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,087
My name is Yeon Juhyun.

259
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,095
Here, hold onto this.
Taekrok will be in touch.

260
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,351
Where's Taekrok right now?

261
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,436
He didn't tell me.

262
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,313
He's worried about you a lot.

263
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,274
What happened to Detective Lee?

264
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,610
Are they still investigating her?

265
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,780
I can't get in touch with her
and I can't look into it.

266
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,573
It's driving me insane.

267
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,368
I know how you feel.

268
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,413
For now, let's trust Taekrok and wait.

269
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,839
Didn't Kim Taekrok tell you?

270
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,677
I have nothing more to add.
You should leave.

271
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,429
I'm going to ask you something else.

272
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,434
Back in 2005,

273
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,854
while conducting
a joint investigation with Chief Baek,

274
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,484
a detective at the Inspection Department
died in an accident.

275
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,694
What does that have to do with me?

276
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,112
That detective…

277
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,948
was in pursuit of the Geumjeong Society.

278
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,915
Why did you kill him?

279
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,110
I stopped by on the way
to Candidate Kim's campaign headquarters.

280
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,904
I heard you weren't coming today.

281
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,950
I didn't want to get in the way
when today isn't about me.

282
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,495
How thoughtful of you.

283
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,830
Oh, right.

284
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,459
Did you get a chance to look over
the policy proposal I sent you?

285
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,793
Ah.

286
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,212
You mean,
the bill to strengthen the police force?

287
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,631
Yes, I read it but…

288
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,677
Perhaps you approached the matter
a bit seriously…

289
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,095
It's a bit radical too.

290
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,182
Also, we're in no rush.

291
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:32,976
Sir.

292
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,398
I know well enough
why the party recruited me.

293
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,026
My recognition, reputation, and image
are all things you need.

294
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,987
But I want to discuss
what the people want from me.

295
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,365
-If the party doesn't support that--
-In due time.

296
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,493
Let's trim the edges and ease up a little.

297
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,337
They say they have to amputate
Jinseok's leg.

298
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,339
My goodness.

299
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,640
Why did you stop me?
I could have shot him.

300
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,683
Why did you stop me? Tell me!

301
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,852
-You punk!
-Calm down, sir!

302
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,219
I'm sorry about earlier.

303
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,852
I would have stopped me if I were you.

304
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,570
But is this right?

305
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,158
We have to walk on eggshells
with the higher-ups

306
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,785
to catch scumbags like that.

307
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,541
We can't even use guns properly
at the scene.

308
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,589
Is this right?

309
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,326
Seonga.

310
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,953
Hey.

311
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,830
Those bastards
kept you in there for hours.

312
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,707
Has Taekrok reached out to you?

313
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,940
Please answer the phone.

314
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,653
Hello?

315
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,904
Mr. Cha.

316
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,782
Assemblyman Lee Youngho
would like to see you.

317
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,833
You remember this thing
you used to say all the time?

318
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,670
In order to protect ourselves,
we should help each other.

319
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,886
Taekrok, let's just pull out.

320
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:59,057
Whether it's his mom's 60th birthday
or 70th, Park Chunkyu won't be coming.

321
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,393
All right?

322
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:09,734
It's been a week since you ate or slept.
You'll die keeping this up.

323
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,701
Yeah?

324
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,954
Okay, all right.

325
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,041
Squad Chief Choi
has Park Chunkyu's location.

326
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,721
-Is this it?
-Yes!

327
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,681
We got him
just before he was about to run.

328
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,853
You fucking asshole.

329
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,605
How dare you, you scumbag?

330
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,568
You son of a bitch!

331
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,028
Get him up.

332
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,738
Hold him.

333
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,657
-Hey, what's going on?
-You goddamn scumbag.

334
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,034
What do you think you're doing?

335
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,952
Let go of me!

336
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,079
I got it, so let me go!

337
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,539
Why did you stop me?

338
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,709
BST took a hit,
so we have to pay him back.

339
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,670
Taekrok, you're the one who said
we should help each other.

340
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,589
-Isn't it?
-All right. Let go.

341
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,841
-God damn it, let go!
-Taekrok.

342
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,345
Isn't this why you made the BST?

343
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,768
All right, let go.

344
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,924
We caught Park Chunkyu.

345
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,175
That's good.

346
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,350
They say they won't pay for it

347
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,227
saying it's all my fault.

348
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,272
Don't worry about the hospital bill.

349
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,899
BST will take care of it.

350
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,901
And after that?

351
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,736
How do I make a living?

352
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,072
My mom's surgery?

353
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,366
And who'll pay for my sister's tuition?

354
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,661
Fuck, I should have just…

355
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,706
I should have just died.

356
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,167
Then my family would get compensated.

357
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,713
What the fuck is this?

358
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,467
What am I going to do?

359
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,447
Bye. See you at the station.

360
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,282
Why did you do it?

361
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,409
You just stood there and watched.

362
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,214
Are you talking about Park Chunkyu?

363
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,884
How could you say that
after seeing Jinseok like that?

364
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,343
You should have stopped them.

365
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,805
Me?

366
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,932
Why?

367
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,059
What?

368
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,395
Isn't the BST about protecting each other?

369
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:38,985
Taekrok.

370
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,615
We're going to have
a lot more power from now on.

371
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,992
With that power,
we can do a lot of things.

372
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,662
That's what we wanted.

373
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,794
No.

374
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,506
This isn't what I want.

375
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,814
SPEECH

376
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:23,071
EVERYONE, PLEASE REMEMBER.
THE POLICE NEED TO BE STRONGER…

377
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,540
We've been waiting at the location
you mentioned yesterday.

378
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,208
But he still hasn't shown up.

379
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,462
Keep looking out for him.
We can't lose him.

380
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,068
Why don't you step out
for a moment, Attorney Choi?

381
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,112
Yes, sir.

382
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,500
You don't look so well.

383
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,796
You must have more worries
than you expected.

384
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,094
I'll get straight to the point.

385
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,930
Secretary Cha.

386
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,183
I'm going to get out.

387
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:40,148
To Choi Dohyung, you are simply a tool.

388
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,277
Yes, I know.

389
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,530
I know what you're thinking.

390
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,992
Things will be harder for me

391
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,037
even if I do get out.

392
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,081
But, Secretary Cha…

393
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,962
you can achieve what I couldn't.

394
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,342
You have to do it yourself.

395
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,011
Me?

396
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,098
All I want is to destroy Choi Dohyung.

397
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,076
What…

398
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,037
do you need me to do?

399
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,212
Someone asked me…

400
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,132
an amusing question yesterday.

401
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,471
LECTURE HALL

402
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,734
A NATIONAL HERO! WE WELCOME CHOI DOHYUNG
TO THE UPRIGHT COUNTRY PARTY.

403
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,112
The PR Department
has prepared some questions.

404
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,700
What made you decide
to start a career in politics?

405
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,209
As you may know,
I was a police officer almost all my life.

406
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,669
And during my service,

407
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:28,464
I witnessed countless innocent civilians
and police officers get killed or hurt.

408
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,634
I thought somebody
would have to change it.

409
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,810
Number 2938. That's the car, right?

410
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,569
Kim Taekrok showed up.

411
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,486
Get him.

412
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,040
And why does that somebody
have to be you, Mr. Choi?

413
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,920
Not only did you disregard orders
and make a private organization,

414
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,257
but is it true you also assaulted
the criminal due to personal feelings?

415
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,092
Who took the lead in this?

416
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,346
-Who's responsible for this?
-It's me.

417
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,143
Creating a private organization,
going on an unauthorized operation,

418
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,603
and assaulting Park Chunkyu.

419
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,688
I took the lead in everything.

420
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,023
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

421
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,234
I'll take responsibility for everything.

422
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,948
The committee has
decided on the following.

423
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:40,578
Sergeant Kim Taekrok. Three-month
suspension and demotion of one rank.

424
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,706
Superintendent Choi Dohyung,
three-month pay cut.

425
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,086
COLLECTIVE EFFORT FOR SECURITY
PEACEFUL SOCIETY

426
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,671
Are you really going to
return to Geumo like this?

427
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,674
-It's for the best.
-No, it isn't.

428
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,301
You're simply running away.

429
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,845
Fine

430
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,306
That could be it.

431
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,308
Because I don't run away.

432
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,061
I'm the kind that knows
how to take responsibility.

433
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,283
It looks like
all preparations are ready.

434
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,161
I'm surprised
you don't seem nervous at all.

435
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,538
Do I seem that way?

436
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,792
Yes. It's as if you've always been here
from the beginning.

437
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,921
This is something
I've dreamed of for a long time.

438
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:34,715
Starting tomorrow, it won't be
a dream anymore, but a reality.

439
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,552
And a year later,
you'll be an assemblyman yourself.

440
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,387
Yes.

441
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,140
As it should be.

442
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,747
Drop your weapons.

443
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,970
We'll see you tomorrow, then.

444
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,056
Please don't worry about tomorrow
and have a good night's sleep.

445
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,058
I will. Thank you.

446
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,185
Goodbye then.

447
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,237
-What?
-I think we've been tricked.

448
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,573
Some of the boys have been captured.

449
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,409
What are you talking about?

450
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,331
BE SAFE

451
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,627
TODAY TOO!

452
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,674
BE SAFE TODAY TOO! FROM AN OLD FRIEND

453
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,023
BE SAFE TODAY TOO! FROM AN OLD FRIEND

454
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:22,949
OLD FRIEND

455
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,091
Why did you tell the higher-ups about BST?

456
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,469
Did you have to?

457
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:48,224
You were the one who made it,
so why did you end it like that?

458
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,144
I shouldn't have formed BST
in the first place.

459
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,732
I started something
I couldn't take responsibility for.

460
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:24,135
COLLECTIVE EFFORT FOR SECURITY
PEACEFUL SOCIETY

461
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,054
YOUNGSEO WELFARE FOUNDATION

462
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,681
In a shocking turn of events,

463
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,976
a group of men caught yesterday
for armed robbery with illegal weapons

464
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,854
turned out to be former police officers.

465
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,647
Police say they will investigate the case,

466
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,025
saying they found evidence
of their involvement

467
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:43,571
in the death of a homicide detective
at Geumo Police Station a few days ago.

468
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:02,214
It seems that the guys who were caught
yesterday gave up info about the hideout.

469
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,425
We should have been careful.

470
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,430
Tell the others not to step foot
in Geumo for the time being.

471
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,348
Yes, sir.

472
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,351
But the Youngseo Provincial Agency
summoned Chief Baek for an investigation.

473
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,477
Don't worry about that.

474
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,563
Chief Prosecutor Won Jaegu will take
care of it before things get out of hand.

475
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,939
Yes, sir. Understood.

476
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,574
What has the police shown us so far?

477
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:33,204
You keep protecting your own,
and there are allegations everywhere!

478
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,667
We'll be investigating

479
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,379
the evidence being tampered with
alongside the Lee Youngho case.

480
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,798
So, with that in mind,
hand over Chief Baek to us.

481
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,974
Now, hang up!

482
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,063
What is all this?

483
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,237
NO CALLER ID

484
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,578
Did you get them?

485
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:17,832
Are you…

486
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,167
Kim Taekrok?

487
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,212
They'll be looking at the same photos
at the Inspection Division

488
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,797
of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office.

489
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,881
What?

490
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,343
Do you know who I am?

491
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,178
How dare you threaten me?

492
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,014
Choi Dohyung,
whom you left Lee Youngho for,

493
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,391
will crash and burn today.

494
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,310
Make the right decision.

495
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,861
PROSECUTION SERVICE

496
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,339
All right. Let's get back on track.

497
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,176
What do you mean?

498
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,470
Wasn't I being sent
to the Prosecutor's Office?

499
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:17,475
I'm not sure what happened exactly,
but the Chief Prosecutor backed out.

500
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,811
I guess you were trying to
cut a deal with them.

501
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,564
Give up on that and cooperate.

502
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,108
You're the one who should be careful.

503
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:29,945
I've seen plenty of guys like you get
stabbed in the back for trusting people.

504
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,910
You saw the news, right?

505
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,206
Yes, I did.

506
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,001
The issue with the police
broke out just in time.

507
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,505
The party sees this as a good opportunity.

508
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,800
Why don't you announce

509
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,470
that you'll uncover the truth of this case

510
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,139
at the welcome ceremony today?

511
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,810
It aligns with your cause

512
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,021
and people will pay attention.

513
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,149
I'm not sure.

514
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,818
Not much has been revealed yet.

515
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,072
Isn't it too early to say that?

516
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:18,702
The party chair actually wants you
to lead the special investigation team.

517
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,331
He really expects much from you.

518
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,169
An investigation team?

519
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,212
Yes.

520
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:33,259
The detective who uncovered
the Geumo redevelopment scandal last year

521
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,844
happened to come by and suggested it.

522
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,430
The party chair really liked the idea.

523
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,351
That detective agreed to be part
of the investigation team too.

524
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,019
That detective…

525
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,730
Detective Kim Taekrok.

526
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,151
I heard you knew each other well.
You'll have no problems working together.

527
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,781
It will really make the perfect picture.

528
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,911
Like a hero appearing
in the midst of chaos.

529
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,583
Ah.

530
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,169
-You have a guest, ma'am.
-Oh.

531
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,338
Let me excuse myself for a bit.

532
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,474
CANDIDATE 2 KIM JINSUN

533
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,393
CHIEF PROSECUTOR WON JAEGU

534
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,542
NO CALLER ID

535
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,982
Kim Taekrok.

536
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,112
Are you trying to play games with me?

537
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:18,781
What's next?

538
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,574
You're the one who started this game.

539
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,203
I'm just trying to end it.

540
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,336
You're just as I expected, Kim Taekrok.

541
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,712
I was right.

542
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:39,426
I knew that if I had Kook Jinhan
give you a lead, you'd go after him.

543
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:43,347
Even when I arrested Chairman Jang,
his associates didn't get revealed.

544
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,350
At that time,
Assemblyman Lee Youngho of this region

545
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,726
was the only one who faced charges.

546
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,771
What if 0121 represents
Assemblyman Lee Youngho?

547
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,899
That means large-scale acts of corruption
in the political and business realms

548
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,735
are taking place right here in Geumo.

549
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,655
I knew that if I gave you
the hint and provoked you,

550
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,282
you'd take care of it on your own.

551
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,578
So don't tell me what to do, you scumbag!

552
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,793
What are your orders?

553
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,628
In the name of Geumjeong Society,

554
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,506
we must eliminate him.

555
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,050
Do I kill both Kook Jinhan
and Kim Taekrok?

556
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,641
Just Kook Jinhan.

557
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,741
That's it?

558
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,660
That's why you let me live?

559
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,745
Yes.

560
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,834
You ought to be grateful
that I even let you live.

561
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,549
Now it's too late. You crossed the line.

562
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,260
Yes.

563
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,888
I'm going to cross that line

564
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,639
and go all the way.

565
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,729
I'm going to catch you no matter what.

566
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:27,075
SHADOW DETECTIVE SEASON 2
