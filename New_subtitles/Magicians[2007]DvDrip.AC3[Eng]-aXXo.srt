1
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,716
Oh, man, we rock! We rock so hard.
I was amazing, you were brilliant.

2
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,475
Together, we were shitting gold, pure gold.

3
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,152
You must admit, it is going well.

4
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,189
Maybe. Maybe, so far,
the whole thing isn't a total fucking fiasco.

5
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,599
Oh, God, Carol!
God, I'm so sorry, sweetheart. We were so...

6
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,353
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay, no thanks to you.

7
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,317
Great work on the box trick tonight.

8
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,118
Of course I did great work on the box trick.

9
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,668
I always do great work on the box trick.

10
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,194
I'm the boxpert, yeah. It's what I do.

11
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,435
Well, yeah.
Listen, I have to check in with the manager.

12
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,954
Yeah? Good, 'cause me and Karl
have something we need to check, too.

13
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,508
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You know, what we talked about?

14
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,237
- What, you mean now?
- Yes, now.

15
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,833
See you later, Harry.

16
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,149
Okay, I'm going to extend your run.
I want you to do another four weeks.

17
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,800
That's potentially very exciting.

18
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,156
Then I've got to do a week
of the Hungarian State bleeding Circus.

19
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,477
I mean, three men and a chicken?

20
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,439
How is that even a circus?

21
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,871
In the meantime, I have an associate
who is looking for a cruise ship act.

22
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,951
Very nice boat, very lucrative.

23
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,031
- You interested?
- Brilliant. We'll do it.

24
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,676
I mean, I should probably check with Karl...

25
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,079
But don't ask anyone else, will you?

26
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,391
I mean, I can't stress enough,
Karl really is a total formality.

27
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,589
Karl?

28
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,630
Carol, what are you... Where's Karl?

29
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,112
Oh, I don't know.

30
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,514
What's in the box?

31
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,669
Don't open the box, Harry!

32
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,189
Why not?

33
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,595
Just...

34
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,392
What the... Karl!

35
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,879
Oh, God.

36
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,915
You...

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,036
Okay, look, so maybe this has happened,

38
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,271
but let's just, for the next hour,
pretend it hasn't happened.

39
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,316
How would you feel about that?
Does that sound like a plan?

40
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,350
The thing about the Vegetator
is that it will never,

41
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,510
and, I repeat, never need sharpening.

42
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,876
You can cut your Tommy tomatoes with it,
you can cut your potatoes with it.

43
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,918
It's so sharp, it can cut through tin cans.

44
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,752
You can even cut right through
your own flesh into the bone

45
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,229
if you're feeling depressed or Ionely.

46
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,037
Bloody hell! Are you all right?

47
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,509
Of course, with a knife like this,

48
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,114
you're never likely
to be depressed or Ionely.

49
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,591
This knife basically guarantees happiness.

50
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,238
I'm making a complaint.

51
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,678
I'm sorry. It's fun, magical fun.

52
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,551
- I think they liked it.
- I don't know what his problem is.

53
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,834
That is a great trick.

54
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,912
I think they left with a feeling of wonder.
That's the important thing.

55
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,833
Yeah, and I doubt
he's actually going to make a complaint.

56
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,952
I mean, loads of people have said
they're going to, but who actually has?

57
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,676
Greetings. I am Mind Monger,
and I am about to enter your brain.

58
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,318
I don't know. The beard just feels wrong.

59
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,398
Then let's lose the beard, man.

60
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,675
You're not married to the beard.

61
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,672
As your agent, that's why I'm here,
help you make these hard choices.

62
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,511
So, this big pitch.
I thought I could kick off with a dove trick,

63
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,431
but, sort of, mind-reader style.

64
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,476
You know, say that
I'm projecting thoughts into its little...

65
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,595
No, Karl.

66
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,994
With the right spin, we can make just about
any kind of magic appear cool,

67
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,034
but not doves.

68
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,629
Otto...

69
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,711
Doves aren't going to get you on TV, Karl.

70
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,275
No, don't...

71
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,710
Otto, the dove was stage-prepared.

72
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,515
- Wing-clipped.
- What?

73
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,593
Oh, shit.

74
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,598
So, purpose of loan is basically...

75
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,911
Eating, staying alive.
Is there a category for that?

76
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,636
General. Okay.

77
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,709
And in the last five years

78
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,268
have there been
any major changes to your circumstances?

79
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,476
I am widowed. I'm a widower.

80
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,950
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

81
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,838
And do you mind if I ask, for the form,
how she died?

82
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,278
Right. She... She was...

83
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,872
- You know.
- No. Sorry.

84
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,713
It was the usual.

85
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,915
The usual?

86
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,795
Decapitated.

87
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,109
Blimey! Was that a traffic incident?

88
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,475
Magic. It was a magic accident.

89
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,834
Magic?

90
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,390
I actually cut her head off with a guillotine.

91
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,515
Shit!

92
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,556
I mean, no blame was attached to me.

93
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,232
That's been proved in a court of law.

94
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,709
Well, a coroner's court,
which is a court of law in point of fact.

95
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,917
It was a freak accident. There were
seven different safety mechanisms, so...

96
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,389
Right.

97
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,031
You're not putting anything bad down,
are you?

98
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,431
I'm a standard applicant.
Put that, "standard applicant," won't you?

99
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,509
Sure.

100
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,920
"Standard applicant."

101
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,710
Just putting it twice.

102
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,318
What are we waiting for? What time is it?

103
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,709
What time is it? It's pitch o'clock.

104
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,469
It's five to pitch.

105
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,478
Okay. Okay, come on. Just keep moving.

106
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,278
I'm just really, really not sure
this is a good idea.

107
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,749
Hello. We're here for Caroline. Laters.

108
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,796
- I need to see your passes.
- You do not need to see our passes.

109
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,314
- I do need to see your passes.
- You have seen our passes.

110
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,710
Let's mind bomb some TV execs.

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,991
What we need is a change in the...

112
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,277
Hi. Caroline, Otto Johnson.

113
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,632
We spoke briefly, once.

114
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,234
You were fascinated by me and my ideas.

115
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,595
I would like to present Karl Allen.

116
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,638
Greetings. I am Mind Monger.

117
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,395
Karl is going to work
some serious fucking magic on your ratings,

118
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,515
if you know what I mean.

119
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,828
Is this a pitch?

120
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,070
It will only take a moment
of your human time.

121
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,957
I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle of a meeting.

122
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,429
I would like you to dip into your brain
and think of a word.

123
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,112
Would you both please leave immediately?

124
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,633
A word, a simple word.

125
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,392
Okay, dickhead.

126
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,040
- My word is "dickhead".
- Perfect.

127
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,635
And now, if you would turn to the window
and look out of it,

128
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,679
you will see the exact word
which I have just implanted into your brain.

129
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,437
That doesn't. That says "dickwad".

130
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,875
- It says, "dickhead".
- "Dickwad."

131
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,078
Well, come on!
There's a dick word on the bloody bridge.

132
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,792
Let's let the dream live, yeah?

133
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,394
I have to say, I have a very,
very good feeling about that.

134
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,515
DANl: Hi! Hey, guys!

135
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,794
I just wanted to say, dickwad,
dickhead, whatever!

136
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,838
The big picture was
you actually put a word in her head.

137
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,831
Exactly. Thank you.

138
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,514
I mean, of course you're going to get
a few letters muddled here or there.

139
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,875
I can't even get my broadband working
half the time, you know?

140
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,155
Indeed. And it is a well-known factoid

141
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,198
that most people only use 1%
of their brain capacity.

142
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,636
Even someone like me
is probably only using about 17%

143
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,517
most of the time, so there will be errors.

144
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,955
Exactly. Wow!

145
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,189
Here,

146
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,989
have my card.

147
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,871
Great. The tea girl likes your act.

148
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,639
Tell me, love, are you by any chance
going on that show

149
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,678
where you get to be
controller of a TV channel for a day.

150
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,749
- No.
Right.

151
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,310
Then we should probably fuck off.

152
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,714
Walk with me, Karl.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,959
I'd love to help, really,
but I don't know, Harry.

154
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,909
I just feel now's the time.
Time for me to get back on the magic horse.

155
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,993
Sure. It's just
I really can't book you for anything.

156
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,914
I mean, I know you do a great,
and, no doubt, totally safe show,

157
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,434
but imagine if it came out...
- Is that...

158
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,112
Is that who I think it is?

159
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,237
- Oh, my God! I'm going to shit! Harry Kane!
- Say something to him.

160
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,273
Oh, sure, like I'm just going to
go up to Harry Kane and say something.

161
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,793
Are you trying to kill me?

162
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,869
What about in the shop?

163
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,918
I could dem a few tricks.
I might be something of an attraction.

164
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,719
Not in a good way, Harry.

165
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,028
Look, a guy came in looking for pros
to cold read on a tarot phone line.

166
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,159
I told him people wouldn't be interested,
but maybe...

167
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,229
Right.

168
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,189
Psychic.

169
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,555
Thanks.

170
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,719
So, I'll take you out and show you
my prop van in a bit, but first, coffee.

171
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,713
- How do you like it?
- Weak and white, like my men.

172
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,550
So, this is nice. You've got a nice flat.

173
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,793
I bet you say that to all the men
whose flats you go round to.

174
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,229
Not that you go round
to loads of men's flats.

175
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,993
- It's okay. You were joking.
- Yes. Thank you.

176
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,035
So, this is amazing,
you working in the shop,

177
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,351
and me with no idea
you'd been a magician's assistant for...

178
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,399
The thing is, basically, that is a lie.

179
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,758
A lie?

180
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,150
You see, I really, really want to do this.

181
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,356
I brought a CD to audition. It's not magic.

182
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,715
It's just a dance routine
me and Karen used to do

183
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,835
in the stockroom.

184
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,911
Okay, the thing is...

185
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,198
I'm really sorry about this, but it is
a very prestigious competition and...

186
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,511
Yeah. And this is a really fun dance.

187
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,159
I burned a CD.

188
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,750
Well, I suppose if you've burned a CD.

189
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,839
Okay. So, if you just want to imagine
that there's two of us

190
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,871
standing next to each other
just doing pretty much the same thing.

191
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,472
But if you can't...
If you can't, it doesn't matter.

192
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,029
Okay.

193
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,715
Anyway, you get the idea.
So, what do you think?

194
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,439
I liked it.

195
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,636
Great. What was your favourite bit?

196
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,193
The bit where you were on the floor.

197
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,350
Yeah, that's a good bit, isn't it?

198
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,955
So, look, I know it's not magic,

199
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,874
but what do you say?

200
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,111
Well, my answer is...

201
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,397
- My answer is yes.
- Yes!

202
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,075
- But we'll need a lot of rehearsal.
- Oh, yeah, of course. Totally. I mean...

203
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,438
So, I think we should probably
wait till the next Shield in 2011.

204
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,556
Or maybe the one after? 2015?

205
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,310
But I think with four to eight years practise,
we stand a really strong chance.

206
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,675
<i>...and keep the money.
- Right.</i>

207
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,829
<i>This is my money, I should point out.</i>

208
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,559
<i>It doesn't belong to the production company
or Channel 4. This is mine.</i>

209
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,953
<i>So, with the best will in the world,
I'm going to try to make you not win it.</i>

210
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,637
<i>Sure? All right. Can you sort it out?</i>

211
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,598
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Karl. This is Harry.</i>

212
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,234
Shit.

213
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,675
Yes. Now, listen.

214
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,833
I was thinking we should maybe
enter the Shield together.

215
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,070
Now, look,
I don't want to talk about feelings.

216
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,312
We both have feelings,
that's horribly obvious, but, well,

217
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,516
if you do not wish to think about entering,

218
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,477
please replace the receiver now.

219
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,358
If you wish to hear my thoughts,
please stay on the line.

220
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,232
Okay, it would be strictly business.

221
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,550
In, win, split the money, goodbye.

222
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,430
No bar chat, bonhomie
or late night laugh sessions.

223
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,554
If you're interested,

224
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,833
please state the word "interested"
at this point.

225
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,629
Interested.

226
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,392
<i>Good. Then, I was thinking for the prelims,</i>

227
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,119
we could do the cut-down routine,
the 10-minuter.

228
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,795
If you're on board please state,
"See you there, Harry,"

229
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,871
and we will see each other there.

230
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,518
"See you there, Harry."

231
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,875
- Likewise. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

232
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,075
Likewise.

233
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,834
Could you pass me that magazine,
please, Otto?

234
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,273
Oh, right.

235
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,918
It's like that now, is it?

236
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,070
Not content with dragging me
all the way to Jersey,

237
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,991
now I have to pass him the magazine.

238
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,232
Yeah, pulled a hot one last night.
We did it three times.

239
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,278
Once, immediately we got to my room.
Loads of jizz.

240
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,477
Then first thing this morning. A bit less jizz.

241
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,075
Then about 20 minutes after that,
almost no jizz at all.

242
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,150
- Harry?
- Oh, hi, Tony.

243
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,196
What the hell? Are you off to the Shield?

244
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,032
Why are you taking a ferry, you big loser?

245
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,758
Well, I don't like to fly.

246
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,832
Actually, that may or may not be true,
because I've never actually flown.

247
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,717
Listen, good luck for the Shield.

248
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,028
Don't need it. You do.

249
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,997
- Right.
- Exactly.

250
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,913
- So, what do you think of the pussy?
- What?

251
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,072
You don't get out much, do you?
Ferry pussy?

252
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,673
Oh, come on. I'll show you.

253
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,990
Question: what is
a hunter's favourite place?

254
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,638
Tony, I don't know. Kenya?

255
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,995
Answer: the watering hole,

256
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,355
because that's where all his prey comes
in the end.

257
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,237
- Suck my wand?
- I beg your pardon?

258
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,833
Suck my wand? It's magic.

259
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,718
- I'm so sorry!
- I'll ask up to 30 women a night.

260
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,553
Law of averages, eventually, I'll get a bit.
That is the law.

261
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,312
- Suck my wand?
- Kiss my arse.

262
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,755
Yeah, you will get that occasionally.

263
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,035
Suck my wand?
Want to suck my magic wand?

264
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,997
Not until you've eaten me out.

265
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,196
Oh, now that's just disgusting!

266
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,429
I mean, I was just trying to have a bit of fun

267
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,158
and she has to come out with that.

268
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,878
It's disgusting, right?

269
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,232
Kane! One o'clock, it's Kane!

270
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,270
You know, they say that afterwards
her body ran around on its own

271
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,112
like some kind of weird chicken.

272
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,392
Nice work, Wolfgang.

273
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,675
There will be a card on your dinner table.

274
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,797
Yellow means through to the next round.
Red means no.

275
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,509
Red is a rejection, yeah? You got that?

276
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,275
Good luck.

277
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,713
You'll fucking need it.

278
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,475
There's no method to that, apparently.
He just takes the pain.

279
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,913
Sick bastard.

280
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,951
Yeah, and so, like, the third time,
there was, like, hardly any jizz at all, no...

281
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,909
Bloody Nora! Gee whiz!

282
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,877
Dwight. Dwight.

283
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,155
Bloody hell! How are you doing, kid?

284
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,196
- I've not seen you for...
- Seven months.

285
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,838
Yeah, yeah, something like that. Yeah.

286
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,196
- Hey, it's too long, that, kiddo.
- Yeah. Yeah, it is a bit too long, Dad.

287
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,272
Yeah, exactly.
We should hang out more, huh?

288
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,794
- You never call.
- You never call.

289
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,189
Yeah, well, you never call me, so quits.

290
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,237
So, how are you? What are you doing here?

291
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,833
I'm here for the Junior Shield.

292
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,039
I didn't even know you were into magic.
God, you never tell me anything!

293
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,439
I did tell you, Dad.

294
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,953
No, because I think
I would have remembered.

295
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,393
I definitely did tell you.

296
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,471
All right, Son. Back off a bit there.
I'm still your dad.

297
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,469
Dwight?

298
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,957
That's me. I've got to go.

299
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,758
Good. Good luck.

300
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,116
Don't fuck it up. I'm kidding. Kidding.

301
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,718
Oh, my God. I mean, have you even...
Have you looked in a mirror?

302
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,110
I give up my job at MTV and my screenplay
that was involved in all that litigation,

303
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,679
all for you, and then one bad pitch

304
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,876
and you come
running on back to Head-Chop Harry.

305
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,234
Otto, it's just one comp,

306
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,629
and it was only the post room at MTV
and the screenplay didn't...

307
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,759
Two years! Two years we spend on the look,
the smell of the act.

308
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,671
We spent three months
getting the sideburns the right length

309
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,478
for Christ's sake, Karl.

310
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,989
Oh, right, yeah.

311
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,671
God forbid
I should enter the magic sanctum.

312
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,113
Oh, my God!
Does that mean what I think it means?

313
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,517
They're not? Shit! Kane and Allen.

314
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,393
I have achieved wood.

315
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,309
Gentlemen.

316
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,880
It's like Israel and Palestine.

317
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,474
Yeah, entering
a magic competition together.

318
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,236
Harry! Karl! Together!

319
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,470
Fantastic! This is amazing!

320
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,793
I'm really sorry to have to call you in,

321
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,395
but we need a first round to,
you know, sort the wheat from the chaff.

322
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,315
I just wanted to say to you, Harry, you know,

323
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,359
about the incredibly sad incident.

324
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,750
Our PR people feel that this could be,

325
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,469
not in a tasteless way,
amazing for the comp,

326
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,199
so I just wanted to settle your mind
on that score.

327
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,633
Oh, great.

328
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,878
So, we're a little rusty,
but we'll be performing...

329
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,349
You're through, okay?
That's it. Done and dusted.

330
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,635
Well, I think we'd better just
do a run-through just to freshen up.

331
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,039
So, here is a normal handkerchief.

332
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,351
Actually, Mike, if it's okay,
I thought we'd do something different.

333
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,635
When I had a look,
the dye tubes had got a bit damp, so...

334
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,633
Don't worry on my account. I'm putting
your yellow cards in the envelopes.

335
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,075
- You've decided to change the trick?
- I was going to discuss it before.

336
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,798
I'm sorry I was late, okay?

337
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,950
The hotel had accidentally
booked us a double.

338
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,758
I thought we could do the bullet catch.

339
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,876
Brilliant. Saw you do it in '98.
Lovely illusion.

340
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,110
You're through.
Okay, send in the next guy, will you?

341
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,715
So, right, you want me to stand here
while you point a gun at my head?

342
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,835
It's only blanks, Karl.

343
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,876
They are not blanks. They are live rounds.

344
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,475
I'm just not sure if I'm comfortable with,
you know.

345
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,233
Oh, that's nice. I know what you're implying.

346
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,595
- I didn't say it.
- The implication is clear.

347
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,593
Harry, you cut her head off. Okay?
I don't want you pointing a gun at me.

348
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,116
We were not going to talk, Karl.
We agreed not to talk,

349
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,794
and that was the main thing
we were not going to talk about.

350
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,953
Honestly, guys, relax. You're through, okay?

351
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,635
Listen, Mike, I'm going solo, okay?
Put me down as a solo act.

352
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,793
Okay, fine. If he's going solo,
I'll go solo, too. Put me down for solo.

353
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,472
I can take the heat solo.

354
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,438
It'll be interesting
to see whether you can, Harry.

355
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,559
You don't really think it'll be interesting.
You think I won't be very good.

356
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,475
But, in fact, I will be very good,
and that will be very interesting for me.

357
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,515
Oh, my God! Karl, you will never guess
who I just bumped into in the street.

358
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,717
Answer: Daisy Pryor
from Fast Frame Productions.

359
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,553
She was literally
just simply looking at some cakes.

360
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,394
She's down here scouting for TV talent.
We had a great chat. A great chat.

361
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,835
- Wow, Otto, man!
- Exactly.

362
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,514
What shall I do for her?
What shall I do for the second round?

363
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,875
Mr Potato Head.
That's always pretty amazing.

364
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,718
Yes. Or, do your Potato Head shit,
but you do it Blaine-styling. Up a tree.

365
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,794
Up a tree?

366
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,869
Not up a tree.

367
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,309
In a pond!

368
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,836
- In a pond?
- Not in a pond.

369
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,710
Buried up to your neck in the sand.

370
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,839
- No, I don't like that.
- You, in the freaking sand!

371
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,036
Just your little head poking out.

372
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,635
I will webcast it. Daisy will freak.
There'll be a huge buzz.

373
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,438
German housewives logging on.

374
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,830
Japanese guys probably jerking off
looking at your head.

375
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,558
And here's the pitch,

376
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,517
you don't need food.

377
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,556
You are living off your brain.

378
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,956
I can't say how grateful I am
you flew over at such short notice.

379
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,469
Very brave.

380
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,233
Yeah, well,
I don't have a problem with flying, so...

381
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,154
It is brave.
Thousands of feet up through the thin air.

382
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,188
That's brave.

383
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,989
Yeah, well, I'm just pleased
you want me to be your assistant.

384
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,752
You must be really desperate.

385
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,908
No, that's not the truth.
That's not at all the truth.

386
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,197
And you don't mind about
not doing the dance?

387
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,352
Sure. Sure, I mean,
I might do a bit of the dance

388
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,431
when you're not looking, but...

389
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,509
Joke.

390
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,795
- Wow! Are these all your tricks?
- That's right.

391
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,519
- What's that?
- Oh, that? Levitation kit.

392
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,160
Needs a huge amount of strength
in the forearm.

393
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,356
Karl tried,
but he could never quite manage it.

394
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,749
It was funny once, because we...

395
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,229
Anyway, I had to practise for weeks
after I made it.

396
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,276
You start to think that you're going nuts,

397
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,069
but then, when you take it somewhere
and fry, really fry an audience,

398
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,472
so that you can actually hear them gasp,

399
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,834
then that's an acceptable end to the trick.

400
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,068
- They actually gasp?
- Sometimes.

401
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,117
So, maybe we should go
with the levitation and the sponge balls.

402
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,349
What's this?

403
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,277
- This looks amazing!
- Oh, that. That's not a...

404
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,237
I really wasn't planning on using that.

405
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,117
But this should be the climax of the act.

406
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,269
- No.
- No? Why not?

407
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,352
Why not? Well, because...

408
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,037
That's something that I should
probably explain, which is that...

409
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,153
That in fact the technical skills involved
in manipulating the balls

410
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,151
are actually far greater
than in operating the...

411
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,835
Listen, you may be too close
to your act to realise,

412
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,879
but, trust me, I know what's better out
of sponge balls or a wicked, big guillotine.

413
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,757
- But...
- We're going with the guillotine, Harry,

414
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,956
because I want to win, yeah?

415
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,600
- I'm not messing about.
- No. Sure.

416
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,636
We're going to fuck them. Right, Harry?

417
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,190
- Right.
- No, we are. Say it.

418
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,510
We're going to fuck them.

419
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,669
That's right.

420
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,351
Where are we going to fuck them, Harry?

421
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,317
In the auditorium?

422
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,712
No. No, not the auditorium, Harry.
In the arse.

423
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,791
We're going to fuck them in the arse.

424
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,429
Say it.

425
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,598
We're going to fuck them in the arse.

426
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,757
- Shit! Otto.
- What?

427
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,519
That's her, isn't it? It's Dani.

428
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,875
The TV coffee person we've been texting.

429
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,598
Oh, my God! You are kidding!

430
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,238
She said she might,
but I didn't think she'd actually...

431
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,756
She's come all the way down here?
She's a bloody stalker!

432
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,195
- What?
- Seriously, that... She's mental.

433
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,429
Don't... Don't do it. Honestly,

434
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,478
she probably keeps poo
in her handbag. Seriously.

435
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,235
- Dani?
- Karl!

436
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,790
- Hey there, Dani.
- Hi! God, you're here!

437
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,440
This is just so incredible.

438
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,590
I mean, this morning
I just sat down to have a normal breakfast,

439
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,150
and then this thought popped into my head,
"Why not go and see Karl?"

440
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,391
- Yeah, that's amazing.
- Yeah, isn't it?

441
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,268
- It was you, wasn't it?
- I'm sorry?

442
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,193
You made me come down here, didn't you?

443
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,673
- Well, I...
- You know, influenced me.

444
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,435
I'm under your power.

445
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,953
Well, there may have been seeds planted,

446
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,349
but I would never make you do
anything you didn't want to do.

447
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,477
Right. That's what I expected you'd say.

448
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,159
- So, would you like a drink?
- God, that is freaky.

449
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,389
You knew exactly what I was thinking.

450
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,155
Right, yeah. Vibrations.
So, what would you like?

451
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,037
Come on. You know.

452
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,796
A pint for me, please,
and a white wine for the lady.

453
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,872
Amazing. White wine. Wow.
Yeah, you got me.

454
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,076
That is exactly what I drink.

455
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,754
White wine, or red wine.

456
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,749
Or a lager.

457
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,269
So, music, music, music,
and you're now flying Harry Kane Airlines.

458
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,112
And applause, applause, applause.

459
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,158
Brilliant. So, how am I doing so far?

460
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,993
You're good.
You're really amazingly good at this.

461
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,197
Yeah. Actually, it's a bit tight
round my bum, Harry.

462
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,350
Could you just get a finger in there
and give it a waggle?

463
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,839
Under the strap, obviously.

464
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,272
Not in my bum!

465
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,196
Sure, yes, I'll just get my hands in there,
under there.

466
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,629
So, how do I compare
to your other assistants?

467
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,914
I bet you've had lots.

468
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,672
Not really. Just the one really.

469
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,672
Really? What was she like?
Was she as good as me?

470
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,830
Yeah, well, she was fine.

471
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,878
I might leave the levitation kit here.
My room's packed out and...

472
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,829
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Did you have an affair with her, Harry?

473
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,512
Is that why you don't want to talk about it?

474
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,670
It was... She was...

475
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,035
As a matter of fact, she was my wife.

476
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,429
Your wife? So you're married?

477
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,991
- Oh, no. No, no, no. Not anymore.
- Oh, right. So what happened?

478
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,753
There. I think that should be a bit better.

479
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,751
The sexual harassment is over.

480
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,229
- God, I'm so sorry! Did I...
- Relax, Harry, okay?

481
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,709
You can cup my arse anytime.

482
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,595
Genuine fake turd based on
the 1947 Ted Krueger original design.

483
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,795
It's a classic.

484
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,194
Is it magic?

485
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,113
It's on the borderline,
where magic meets novelty.

486
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,192
Here are the flowers, the flowers of love.

487
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,793
The flowers of love? Oh, God.

488
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,996
Are you kidding me? Lose that.
Don't say that.

489
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,958
Where do they come from?
To whence will they go?

490
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,758
Whence? Oh, whence?

491
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,717
Indeed, whither goeth the flowers?

492
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,917
To Klangindor, perchance,
to charm Princess Hobdongle?

493
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,235
For here is the posy now, and now...

494
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,909
It's gone!

495
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,995
- Thank you.
- Hey, hey, where did you source that?

496
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,116
It's my own mechanism, Dad. I made it.

497
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,316
- Oh. How does it work then?
- Can't say.

498
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,709
Oh, come on, Son.
Don't come the old pro with me. Tell me.

499
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,233
- No.
- That was brilliant.

500
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,835
You might want to rethink the hair,
but the trick was brilliant.

501
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,434
I taught him everything he knows.

502
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,751
The only thing I learnt from you
was how to be a selfish shit.

503
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,429
That's just banter, matey banter.
We're always at it, back and forth.

504
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,069
Anyway, I'm Tony White.
Don't believe the rumours. They're all true.

505
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,028
Except for the duck thing.

506
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,590
I mean, do I actually look
like the sort of bloke who'd suck off a duck?

507
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,758
How deep is he going?
Does he need to go that deep?

508
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,752
What about burrowing creatures?
Have you researched this?

509
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,637
It's perfect. Bye-bye.

510
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,870
That, my friend,
was Fast Frame Productions,

511
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,269
Daisy Pryor. Now she's seen the show reel,

512
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,388
she thinks, and I quote,
she might want your face for their show.

513
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,833
Meeting's tonight at 8:00.

514
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,319
They want my face?

515
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,278
You've made them want my face,
you bloody king!

516
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,394
Okay, tonight at 8:00.
So, the only thing about tonight is

517
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,675
I'm supposed to be meeting Dani for dinner.

518
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,274
- Yeah, well, cancel her.
- Yeah, I'll just cancel her.

519
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,750
Yeah, obviously.
I can't believe you even had to think twice.

520
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,558
Well, I didn't have to think twice.
I just thought once.

521
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,108
Yeah. I can't believe
you even had to think once.

522
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,556
Why do we even want to see
her fat face again?

523
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,234
- She hasn't got a fat face.
- She's got quite a fat face.

524
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,958
I'll just call her and get her to change...

525
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,076
Karl, please, can you stop calling her?

526
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,879
- Why?
- Why? "Why," he asks.

527
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,552
- Well, what about us?
- Us?

528
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,713
- Yes, what about us?
- What "us"? There isn't an "us", is there?

529
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,869
Of course there's an us!

530
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,473
It's me and you, together.

531
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,835
The team. Having a laugh, kissing.

532
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,557
- We don't kiss.
- We just had a kiss.

533
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,074
Yeah, but that was an accident.

534
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,118
An... Right, okay, an accident.

535
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,352
Like the way your leg brushes against mine
every time we take a taxi together?

536
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,192
That's a lot of accidents, Karl.

537
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,798
Harry! Hey, Harry!

538
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,789
Hello, Harry.

539
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,678
I didn't not hear you.
I was ignoring you on purpose.

540
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,193
You know, to be rude.

541
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,272
Right, I get it. Bitter.

542
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,478
Yeah, life after Karl
must be pretty tough, all by yourself.

543
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,596
Yeah, well, I've got a new assistant, actually.

544
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,478
Yes. Karl and I met her in the bar last night.

545
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,316
She seemed pretty surprised when Karl
mentioned the, you know, incident.

546
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,757
Anyway, good luck in the next round.

547
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,589
Can I help you?

548
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,670
Yeah, is... Is... Has... Is this room...

549
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,115
What's going on?
Where's the person from this room?

550
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,998
This room's vacant.
It's been vacant since this morning.

551
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,835
- What? What are you talking about?
- Well, you do know what "vacant" means?

552
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,993
Dirty tricks! You had to resort to dirty tricks.

553
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,069
Harry?

554
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,958
Linda's gone, Karl.
She's gone because of you,

555
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,031
because of what you told her. You shit!

556
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,236
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't realise
it was supposed to be a secret.

557
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,389
It wasn't a secret.

558
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,038
Just because you haven't told
someone something yet

559
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,348
doesn't make it a secret.

560
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,635
I haven't told her I've been to Portugal.

561
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,789
Is that a secret?

562
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,075
I don't know, did you chop
anyone's head off in Portugal?

563
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,472
You'd better shut your mouth, Karl.
Just shut up and apologise.

564
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,834
Shut up and apologise?

565
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,549
Yes, you dick!
Apologise for telling Linda and

566
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:22,475
for what you've never apologised for.
The big thing you've never apologised for.

567
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,313
You should thank me for telling her.
You probably never would have managed it.

568
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,118
Oh, right, I see. Okay.

569
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,873
Yeah, that sounds reasonable.
Thank you, Karl. Thank you very much

570
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,473
for having it away with my wife

571
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,393
and scaring off my assistant
and ruining my life.

572
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,232
Okay, here's a thank you present for you.

573
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,637
Urine. How's that?
Lovely warm urine, all over your head.

574
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,029
Harry, look, don't. Just let's talk about this.

575
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,669
The time for talking has ended, Karl.
The time for pissing has begun.

576
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,311
Damn! I can't go now!

577
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,634
You've got away with it!
Once again, you've got away with it all!

578
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,273
So there's no hydrofoil
or super-fast catamaran?

579
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,112
- It's just the plane?
- That's right.

580
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,351
It's just I've got to get to London and back
in four hours for the second round.

581
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,590
- Do you think that's possible?
- No.

582
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,996
Thanks. That's very reassuring.

583
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,839
Are you okay?

584
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,875
No, I'm not okay.
Didn't you see her, the plane woman,

585
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,839
showing us the emergency exits
and the emergency lighting

586
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,515
and the oxygen masks
falling from the ceiling?

587
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,875
Relax. There's really nothing to worry about.

588
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,154
I mean, if they're expecting that,

589
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,879
I really, really feel
they should cancel the flight.

590
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,959
Would you like one of my sweets
for the air pressure?

591
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,156
I chopped my wife's head off.

592
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,636
Right. Really?

593
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,392
I'm sorry, but I did that.

594
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,391
That's just something I did.
And I just want you to know that,

595
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,835
because, if something happens,

596
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,198
well, maybe I sort of deserve it.

597
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,792
Look, I'm sure you don't deserve it.

598
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,631
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

599
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,518
I'm going to die,
and I'm taking you all with me!

600
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,628
Just here, that's her house.
Thanks for the fast driving by the way.

601
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,757
Although, maybe you should actually
go and check on that dog.

602
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,397
- Will you wait in case she's not in?
- Oh, sure, mate.

603
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,599
Linda, thank God you've called.

604
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,912
I've been trying to get hold of you.
Look, I just wanted to say...

605
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,558
Oh. Oh, right, you've changed rooms.

606
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,631
Sorry. Yeah.
Next door's music was just getting too loud.

607
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,712
Yes, sorry I didn't call,
but my mobile phone was dead.

608
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,996
<i>- Oh. Right.
- Yeah, the billing's out.</i>

609
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,195
Okay, we're third,

610
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,111
<i>so in two hours we're going on.</i>

611
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,953
<i>- Do you want to meet backstage now and...
- Well...</i>

612
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,112
Actually, I can't be there straightaway.

613
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,269
<i>You can't?</i>

614
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,478
No, I'm going to

615
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,352
the solarium.

616
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,668
The solarium?
But, Harry, it's the second round.

617
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,194
Linda, I am unshakeable on this. Sorry.

618
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,271
See you after the solarium.

619
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,315
Back to the airport, please,
as fast as you possibly can.

620
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:57,076
You come across as a very pernickety,
unhelpful sort of man,

621
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,116
but do you think there's any chance at all

622
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,158
that you could, like,
you know, subvert that image

623
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,437
and help us out
by just swapping the act order? That's it.

624
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,750
<i>Could Mr A Smith please let himself
be known to a member of the cabin crew?</i>

625
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,876
<i>We have a message for you.</i>

626
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,474
That's code.
I used to work in a supermarket,

627
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,391
<i>and we played La Cucaracha
if there was a fire.</i>

628
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,789
I'm telling you, that's code.

629
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,632
We're all gonna die.

630
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,311
Thank you!

631
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,475
Is that all you're giving me?
You really are a bunch of hard nuts.

632
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,235
<i>Thank you, Tony White
and his Orbs of Delight...</i>

633
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,551
Don't bother, mate. Unless you can turn
water into wine, this lot aren't interested.

634
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:55,431
<i>... change to our printed billing.
Yes, after an effing bureaucratic nightmare,</i>

635
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,229
<i>would you please welcome to the stage,
before Harry Kane,</i>

636
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,756
<i>Mr Karl Allen, the Mind Monger.</i>

637
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,117
<i>Hello, people. I have a revelation.</i>

638
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,272
<i>In order to test the human capacity
for being buried up to the neck in sand,</i>

639
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,672
<i>the Mind Monger has been buried
up to the neck in sand.</i>

640
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,910
<i>The Mind Monger is asking for a volunteer</i>

641
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,039
<i>to perform the illusion known simply as,
Mr Potato Head.</i>

642
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,030
<i>The Mind Monger will now exactly match</i>

643
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,511
<i>the selection of potato features
chosen by his childlike assistant.</i>

644
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,669
Thank you.

645
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,029
Good.

646
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,635
<i>Now, in yet another moment,
Harry Kane and Linda,</i>

647
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,430
<i>but first up,
it's All The Fun Of The Hair with Dietmar.</i>

648
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,630
<i>Local bylaws require me to warn you</i>

649
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,633
<i>that the climax of this routine
does feature a trouser drop.</i>

650
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,110
<i>But the items revealed,
no matter how realistic they may appear,</i>

651
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,670
<i>are not his actual penis or scrotum.
Thank you.</i>

652
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,634
Sorry.

653
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,879
Linda, I'm so sorry.

654
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,349
- Oh, Harry, we're on in, like, one second.
- Are you okay?

655
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,192
Yeah. What the hell were you doing
at that solarium?

656
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,350
You've been, like, three hours.
Is that even safe?

657
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,954
Yeah, well, it's a tradition of mine.
Gives me that extra edge.

658
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,110
If it works for Copperfield...

659
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,390
<i>And now, at long last,
Harry Kane and Linda.</i>

660
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,358
That was quite a feat, wasn't it?

661
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,830
I mean, apart from the 7UP and the nachos,
I really was living off my brain.

662
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,909
Yeah. Yeah.

663
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,197
Listen, now, I want to talk about
the Fast Frame Productions meet,

664
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,395
about the code word.

665
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,789
If you say anything
that undermines my negotiating power,

666
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,440
I'm going to drop in the code word
and you're going to back off.

667
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,273
- Okay, so what's the code word?
- Courteney Cox.

668
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,998
It's the best code word.
I've used it a hundred times.

669
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,593
- It's totally normal.
- Okay.

670
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,833
Yeah, and listen, about before,

671
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,070
just wanted to say,
you know, I'm sorry about all that.

672
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,833
Oh, it's fine, mate.
I mean, you know, if you're gay, that's fine.

673
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,196
Gay? What? What do you mean, gay?
It's not the '80s.

674
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,315
Right.

675
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,994
Look, I'm...

676
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,832
Remember when we went to Alton Towers?

677
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,832
We went on the Liquidiser.
You got scared. You grabbed my arm.

678
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,831
That was fun, wasn't it?
A hell of a lot of fun.

679
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,433
Yeah. Yeah, that was fun.

680
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,353
Right, so let's just keep having fun.
That's all I'm saying.

681
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,399
Sure. Yeah, fine.

682
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,836
So, remember, if it's all going tits up,
I'll drop in the code word, Courteney Cox.

683
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,592
Well, that wasn't a complete disaster.

684
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,069
We might want to think
about a more exciting theme for the final.

685
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,594
Right. I'm actually working on an idea.
Leave it to me.

686
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,079
I mean, if we qualify.

687
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,118
You know the tan's actually
gone to your collar, Harry?

688
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,591
What? That's not possible.

689
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,399
Harry, just tell me the truth.
Where did you go?

690
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,275
All right. The thing is...

691
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,758
Look, it was complicated.

692
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,271
When I saw your room was empty,
I went to your house.

693
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,909
I thought what Karl said to you
last night might have...

694
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,917
- You flew to London?
- Yes.

695
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,279
I mean, don't you mind that I chopped
my wife's head off and didn't tell you?

696
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,874
Harry, I'm a glass-half-full kind of person,
you know.

697
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,632
If you hadn't chopped your wife's head off,

698
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,312
we wouldn't be here doing this.

699
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,914
- Plus, lightning doesn't strike twice.
- Quite.

700
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,753
I mean, technically it can, but it won't.

701
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,276
I mean, I'd be more worried
if I was doing a guillotine trick

702
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,715
with someone who hadn't
chopped his wife's head off.

703
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,313
Exactly.

704
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,519
So you conquered your fear of flying
just to come and find me?

705
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,071
Well, yes.

706
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,399
That's pretty romantic.

707
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,550
It's just the competition.
I really want to win the competition.

708
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,153
Come on.

709
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,514
- Linda...
- It's okay, Harry.

710
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,514
We can both feel it.
You like me and I like you.

711
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,953
It's out there.

712
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,669
- No.
- Come on, Harry, cut the bullshit.

713
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,832
You're this close to kissing me.

714
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,910
No. I'm not.

715
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,228
Oh, fuck!

716
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,757
On behalf of Fast Frame Productions,

717
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,957
I want to say
it's very good to meet you both.

718
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,235
This is an exciting project.

719
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,392
Very exciting, because, you know...

720
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,596
We want to shake off the whole Doris Stokes

721
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,636
tea leaves and twin sets image of a medium.

722
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,438
- Exactly.
- A medium?

723
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,351
Yeah. Don't worry, Karl.
You're in the right meeting.

724
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,830
We were thinking, and I don't really
like this idea, but it might be popular,

725
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,153
that you could talk to murder victims
and get them to say who murdered them.

726
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,118
Or we could do a brainy-style show,

727
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,237
with dead people, like
Mozart or Sherlock Holmes,

728
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,914
reviewing that week's TV through you.

729
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,673
Right. That's interesting.

730
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,039
I just wonder how do you feel
that someone like, maybe Courteney Cox,

731
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,793
would feel about
doing a medium show like that?

732
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,232
Good question. Richard?

733
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,470
- Courteney Cox?
- I think she'd love it.

734
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,711
So we're basically talking 15-minute slots
in half-hour shows?

735
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,598
Yeah. The other half
will be a spiritual healer,

736
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,309
<i>where the blind andlor sick
place one hand on the screen</i>

737
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,389
and with the other navigate

738
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,596
through the interactive guide
to a payment system.

739
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,240
- lf it ever works, which I doubt it will.
- That's cool.

740
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,311
Right. But, I mean, do you think, Otto,

741
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,551
<i>that Courteney Cox out of Friends
would be into something like that?</i>

742
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,074
Yeah, I think she would. So, contracts?

743
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,833
Sure, but would she really, though?
Courteney Cox?

744
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,912
<i>- I'm sorry. He's obsessed with Friends.
- Right.</i>

745
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,276
So, Karl will be doing this new medium act
if he makes it to the final?

746
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,634
- Is that right?
- Yes.

747
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,709
Courteney Cox!

748
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,475
Great. Then everyone back at head office
will get a chance to see it on TV,

749
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,949
and if all goes well,
we can sign the deal right here.

750
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,519
- Great.
- Courteney Cox, Courteney Cox.

751
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,272
- Courteney Cox!
- Excellent.

752
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,671
A TV show? That's brilliant!

753
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,115
- Yeah, but I'm not really sure about it.
- Why?

754
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,715
Well, you know, it's medium stuff.
You know, contacting the dead.

755
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,233
Oh, right. Wow.

756
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,954
Is that draining?

757
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,911
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

758
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,194
Plus, you know, I mean,

759
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,032
magic has traditions,
sort of codes of conduct.

760
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,111
There are some things you don't do,

761
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,952
but then, getting on TV is hard.

762
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,508
You can't just ring up and
say you're going to fill in for Jamie Oliver.

763
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,511
Yeah, but anyone can just make a sandwich

764
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,955
and go on and on about it.

765
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,678
You can contact the dead.

766
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,354
Yeah. Yep.

767
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,513
Karl, you know I feel really close to you.

768
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,709
Yeah.

769
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,236
And I'm really looking forward to tonight.

770
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,914
But I was just thinking, just now,

771
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,150
do you think maybe
you could contact someone for me?

772
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,596
Contact someone? Oh, no, no, no, no.
I don't think so, Dani.

773
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,989
It's just, you know, my dad. I just...

774
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:10,200
I really, really miss him
and sometimes, I wish... I just wish...

775
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,113
There are just so many things
I didn't get to say to him.

776
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,794
I really can't. I mean, I don't...

777
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,950
No, no. Sure.
Sure, if you can't or won't, that's...

778
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,555
No, I mean, it's not like that.
It's just, you know, I...

779
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,995
Okay, well... Okay, maybe I could... I'll just...

780
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,277
Hold on.
Yeah, I'll just see if there's anything...

781
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,839
Yeah, okay.

782
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,556
Oh, all right. Yeah, I'll tell her.

783
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,517
Okay, so here's the thing.

784
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,192
He's not available right now.

785
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,709
I've been told the ectoplasm, it's too thick,

786
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,791
so, I mean,
there's just no way through right now.

787
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,872
That was an actual message
from the other side?

788
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,995
Yes.

789
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,113
You actually got through to the other side
in front of my very eyes?

790
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,836
That is amazing!

791
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,433
Yeah. Yeah.

792
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,593
I mean, it's just an administrative call really,
but, yeah. Yeah, I did.

793
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,951
I've told you once,
I don't want to tell you again,

794
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,190
so, fuck you, yeah? Fuck you.

795
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,475
He's not going through
because he didn't get enough votes,

796
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,357
and no, you can't count them yourself,

797
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,876
because they've been shredded, okay?
This isn't Sweden here, Lenny.

798
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,872
This is North Korea. This is Syria. Get it?

799
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,272
Okay! So, welcome to
all our second-round contestants.

800
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,999
In here are the names of the finalists.

801
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:45,232
Can I just say if, when you hear them,
you find yourselves raising your eyebrows,

802
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,471
just remember, it's going out
on the Home Space Channel,

803
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:55,272
and it wouldn't fit with their demographic
if all the magicians were men, apparently.

804
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,399
So, naming no names,
but some people have been very lucky.

805
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:04,073
So, the finalists for the Shield are...

806
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,395
Greg Davis.

807
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,231
Dietmar's World of Wigs.

808
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,753
Magibot.

809
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,038
The Remarkable Carringtons.

810
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,156
Mandy Pandy.

811
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,475
Karl Allen, Mind Monger.

812
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:33,077
Last, and in some senses,
i.e. the number of votes cast, least,

813
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,037
Tony White's Orbs of Delight.

814
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,111
Just warming up, my friends,
just warming up.

815
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,550
Oh, and of course, the latecomers,

816
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,953
Harry Kane and Linda.

817
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,710
Linda, obviously, is a woman,
but apparently that doesn't count

818
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,076
because she is an assistant.
You literally could not make it up.

819
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,917
Okay, everyone. Big smiles.

820
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,070
So, Karlos, what's your routine for the final?

821
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,434
Actually, I can't say.

822
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,512
Oh, come on, mate, nobody's going to be
vanishing a car ferry. What are you doing?

823
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,509
Well, you know, I mean, this whole thing's
a crock of crap, obviously,

824
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,477
so I just thought I'd,
you know, freak everyone out,

825
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,791
do something a bit different,
a bit of medium stuff.

826
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,676
Medium? You're going to do psychic?

827
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,239
It'll be with a very modern twist.

828
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,639
Oh, my God!

829
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,039
Okay, big smiles, everyone.

830
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,718
Look, what exactly is so great
about being able to pretend

831
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,836
that you can produce
endless flags out of a hat?

832
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,194
Isn't it actually a lot better

833
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,953
to be able to bring someone a message
of hope from the other side?

834
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,792
No, sure, and it's just right for you.

835
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,394
It's phoney, it's manipulative, it's dishonest.

836
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,392
Actually, could we just bring the assistants
forward a bit?

837
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,917
Listen, Harry, just because
you've never experienced

838
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,639
anything more amazing
than a packet of McCain Micro Chips,

839
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,792
doesn't necessarily mean
it doesn't exist, okay?

840
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,919
Oh, great, and tell us, Karl,
what do you see on the other side

841
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,798
from your big supernatural umpire's chair?

842
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,871
Every single person who's ever died?

843
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,714
Plato and millions and millions
of Chinese peasants and Bob Hope?

844
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,113
I tell you what I can see.

845
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,432
I can see Carol, your wife,
with her head cut off,

846
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,114
and the head is on the floor, crying.

847
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,711
Let's magic up
some big smiles.

848
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,435
Well, he's late, isn't he? He is late.

849
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,193
So, you managed to get rid of,
what's her name, the nutter?

850
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,272
Otto, you know what her name is,
and I'm sorry, but I really, really like her.

851
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,509
Bollocks!

852
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,273
You haven't even slept with her yet,
have you? You haven't, have you?

853
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,237
No, but I'm really looking forward to it.

854
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,108
You are not looking forward to it.
You're scared out of your wits.

855
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,553
I know you, Karl.

856
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,596
You haven't been able to get it up
for four years,

857
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,194
and your last lay was a total disaster.

858
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,508
No, it wasn't.

859
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,070
As a result, your career ended and
your best friend's wife died.

860
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,309
That was a good lay, was it?

861
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,913
Yeah, but that was just a one-off, wasn't it?

862
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,912
Exactly, a one-off, an aberration.

863
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,838
We've all taken a wrong turn
and ended up somewhere weird.

864
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,349
Like a vagina.

865
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,795
Otto, I am not gay.

866
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,075
Honestly, though, mate,
what are you going to do

867
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,674
when the knickers come off
and it comes at you, eh?

868
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,157
With its great hairy flaps
all flapping and flying, eh?

869
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,710
What are you going to do?
You haven't got the faintest idea, have you?

870
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,272
Okay, first off, I object to the term "stooge".

871
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,999
Oh, look at the stooge.
Let's laugh at the stooge.

872
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:32,073
Let's make the stooge fight the goon
for our entertainment. No.

873
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,671
I'm sorry. I am an assistant magician.

874
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,309
Sure, but just to clarify,
we're paying the stooge rate, yeah?

875
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,995
That's fair enough.

876
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,909
So, a lot of people are like,
"Well, what's a stooge do?"

877
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,115
"Just acts normal."

878
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,668
Well, yeah, normal is very hard.

879
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,239
I like to give it some of this.

880
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,514
Who, me?

881
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,995
See?

882
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,398
I ain't doing much but a touch.
Because some stooges, they're like,

883
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,597
"Who, me? I can't believe it!"

884
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:08,550
No. I like to keep it real,
but then, you see, I give it the trip.

885
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,039
Just a tiny little stumble.

886
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,278
Nothing OTT, just a very nice little...

887
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,435
Did you catch that?

888
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,509
You see, that's my trademark. That is acting.

889
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:26,310
<i>Hamlet is a piece of piss
if you can master the trip.</i>

890
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,312
What's wrong?

891
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,153
It's just, what I thought
we were about to do,

892
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,798
although I don't want to
jump to any conclusions.

893
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,996
You're nervous about the final, aren't you?

894
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,553
If you want, we could do some rehearsal.

895
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,434
Why don't you project a thought
into my mind, and I'll try and receive it?

896
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,919
- Dani...
- Is it a squirrel?

897
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,069
No, I'm not...

898
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,072
It's a hexagon.
A squirrel trapped in a hexagon.

899
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,597
No, no, no. I don't want to practise.
I want to do what we were going to do.

900
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,558
It's just... I've not exactly had...

901
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,551
I haven't done it for... Much...

902
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:12,829
For quite a long while, and the last time,
it didn't go very well.

903
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,990
Oh, why? What happened?

904
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:20,632
Well, there were issues.
You know, male issues. I couldn't...

905
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,829
- Put your gloves on?
- No.

906
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:29,357
I couldn't rise to the occasion.

907
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,273
Oh, poor you!

908
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,432
You don't have to worry about that.
It's okay. Really, it's okay.

909
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,877
Oh, well,
it's quite a relief to hear you say that,

910
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,598
because the last person I was with,

911
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,990
she was very much
of the opinion that it wasn't okay.

912
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,594
Those were her exact word words, in fact.

913
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,079
"This is not okay.

914
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,318
"This is not okay, Karl."

915
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,268
Oh, that's horrible.

916
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:02,874
I think if we get the new theme right,
then it's between us,

917
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,032
Karl, the Remarkable Carringtons
and Greg Davis.

918
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,032
And Greg's always going to
have the charges hanging over him.

919
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,157
Unfounded, of course,
but no one remembers that, do they?

920
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,512
Cut the bullshit, Linda.

921
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,076
You're this close to kissing me.

922
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,795
Let's cut the bullshit, Linda,

923
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,838
and just have a massive, great big screw.

924
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,950
- What's this, Harry?
- What?

925
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,190
This list in your trouser pocket.

926
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,235
"Linda,

927
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,471
"pros and cons."

928
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,993
That's actually private.

929
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,196
I'd rather you didn't read
from my private journals.

930
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,271
"Cons, the dance."

931
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,590
- So you didn't like my dance?
- I did.

932
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,433
- Then why is it on the bloody cons?
- It's...

933
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,080
"Bum." Oh, thanks. Thank you. Thanks a lot.

934
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,755
There are pros. Look at the pros.
Bum is in pros and cons.

935
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,398
What does that mean? What?
It's big, but you like it?

936
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,471
Well, what about your great, big, fat arse?

937
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,198
Linda, let's not get personal.

938
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,918
<i>"Unstablelmental."</i>

939
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,355
Look at the pros!
You're focusing on the cons.

940
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,232
"Enjoys Thai food."

941
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,595
What is wrong with liking Thai food?

942
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,831
I just think it's samey.
But that's a very minor concern.

943
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,831
That's right at the bottom, Linda.

944
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,592
You are a complete weirdo.

945
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,477
What kind of a robot writes a list?

946
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,391
Do you want to hear my list?

947
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,677
You are an emotionally retarded coward.

948
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,751
Yeah, with a Hitler haircut.

949
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,030
You can't just ignore the pros!

950
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,955
Linda!

951
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,436
Oh, yes, Dani, it's working! It's a stayer.

952
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,479
Great! But, Karl, just before we, you know,

953
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,630
there's something I was wondering
if you'd do for me.

954
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,994
Of course. Anything.

955
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,991
Because I really want to be, you know,
in the moment,

956
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,311
but I just can't stop thinking about my dad,
so I was wondering,

957
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,118
maybe you could try again?

958
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,393
Contact your dad?

959
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,594
- Now?
- Yeah.

960
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,110
Because I've been thinking about
doing a course, retraining,

961
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,397
and I can't decide whether to go
for accountancy or media studies.

962
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,030
Can you ask him what he thinks?

963
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,838
Sure. Yeah, let's have a...

964
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,113
Well, he's there.

965
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,990
And there's a message coming through,
and the message is,

966
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,559
"Follow your heart."

967
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,313
Mention one has more flexibility,
the other offers more long-term security.

968
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,435
Okay.

969
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,318
Thanks. Accounting.
He says definitely accounting.

970
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,915
Right. Got to follow in Daddy's footsteps.

971
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,999
Just what I expected.

972
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,149
Actually... Actually, while he's there,

973
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,629
can you just ask him
what he thinks about you?

974
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,835
I'm sorry?

975
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:08,792
I always took boyfriends home to meet Dad
before we, you know, got serious.

976
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,236
Oh. Well, I'll just check.

977
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,555
Thank you.

978
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,316
He says, "Karl's a good guy. Trust Karl."

979
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,356
Really? He said that?

980
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,910
"He's a very respectable young man."
Those were his exact words.

981
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,592
Really?
That kind of doesn't sound like him...

982
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,069
Look, basically he likes me.
I mean, that's the thrust of it.

983
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,469
He thinks I'm a great guy
and we should just get down to it.

984
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,630
He said we should get down to it?

985
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,312
God! That is so weird.

986
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,995
He sounds drunk.

987
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,791
Oh, God. He's started drinking again.

988
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:52,717
Listen, Dani, your dad, he's not drinking,

989
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,998
and he didn't tell me
that you should study accountancy.

990
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,958
- He thinks I should do media studies?
- No, he...

991
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,998
The truth is, he didn't tell me anything.

992
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,308
What?

993
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,072
I'm not a medium, Dani.

994
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,835
I've never talked to your dad,
and I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

995
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,748
What?

996
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,958
So you just

997
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,919
lie?

998
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,834
Not lie exactly. It's more magic.

999
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,674
You know, there are certain techniques.
It's... It's meant to be fun.

1000
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,399
Yeah, right, fun! Is this fun?

1001
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,630
- Look, I didn't mean to trick you, Dani.
- Get out, Karl!

1002
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,711
Just get out, you fucking liar!

1003
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,034
Oh, yes.

1004
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,470
It's not what it looks like, Otto.
I'm locked out of my room.

1005
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:55,109
Sure. Sure, you are.
I'll play your little game, Karl.

1006
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,956
<i>please welcome the chairman of the judges,</i>

1007
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,600
<i>Magic Table Shieldist of 1985,</i>

01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,033
<i>and the man we have to thank</i>

1009
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,669

1010

01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,997
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

1012
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,798
<i>So, here we are again.</i>

1013
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,792
<i>Without further ado,
let's meet our first contender</i>

1014
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,269
<i>for the ultimate magic accolade.</i>

1015
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,113

1016
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,351

1017
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,272
Curtain. It's your stage, the Monger.

1018
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,515
- "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen..."
- Yeah.

1019
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,160
I don't know if you've seen Dani
in the audience, have you?

1020
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,913
- I mean, I reserved her a seat, but I...
- Karl! Karl...

1021
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,070
Okay, just listen to me.

1022
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,197
You have to focus, okay?

1023
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,077
Forget about Dani and focus.

1024
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,639
No, sure. Focus, yeah.

1025
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,188
Yeah. That is the important thing, all right?

1026
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,670
Focus, focus, focus.

1027
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,718
I love you. Focus. Focus.

1028
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,237
Yeah. I'm just going to go and
focus over there for a bit, if that's cool.

1029
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,514
<i>make your way to the stage, please.</i>

1030
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,512
All right, Harry. Nice to see you
getting ahead in the business again.

1031
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,158
Heady days, eh? Heady days.

1032
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:32,189
Oh, right, a bit of pre-match sledging,
Tony, you big crap magician.

1033
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,269
Oh, ouch, that hurts. Hey, I'm happy for you.

1034
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,510
You've got that
gorgeous new assistant, yeah.

1035
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,997
Sucks a wand real nice.

1036
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,672
What? What are you...

1037
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,593
Oh, we bumped into each other
first night in the dealer's hall.

1038
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,592
Hit the bar,
then up to my room, fully loaded.

1039
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,718
Loads of jizz.

1040
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,198
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Tony White.</i>

1041
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,518
Good evening, Jersey!

1042
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,474
Is that it? Bloody hell.

1043
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:11,755
You gave the Nazis
a warmer welcome than that.

1044
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,676
It's a joke. Right.

1045
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,231
Hey, Linda, listen.
I wanted to ask you a question.

1046
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,993
Look, Harry, if it's about the new theme,
relax, okay?

1047
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,640
It's not in bad taste, it's just edgy.
There's a big difference.

1048
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,517
Did you sleep with Tony White?

1049
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,959
- What?
- He told me just now.

1050
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,713
Everything. But I wanted to hear it from you.

1051
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,956
Tell me, Linda. I've a right to know.

1052
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,836
Why? You don't have feelings for me.

1053
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,911
- Well, no.
- Exactly.

1054
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,839
So, did you?

1055
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,593
Well, yes, if you actually want to know,
I did.

1056
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:50,071
- But, why?
- Because he was there.

1057
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,993
- You know, we're not going out, are we?
- No, obviously. Not at all.

1058
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,479
Right, so just because I'm a woman,

1059
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,791
it doesn't mean I can't enjoy
a meaningless fuck now and again.

1060
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,915
Yes, of course.

1061
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,310
And you don't mind me,
you know, humping him raw.

1062
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,473
- Why would I mind?
- Or having a chug on his big man cock.

1063
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,870
No. In fact, happy chugging.

1064
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,039
See you on stage.

1065
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:29,115
And after the Rings of Married Bondage,
I bring you

1066
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,077
the Flowers of Love.

1067
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:37,429
And much like human love, one minute
it's there, but by morning, 'tis gone.

1068
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,714
Thank you.

1069
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,750
A little trick for you there
that was invented by...

1070
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,717
By my enormous brain.

1071
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,155
Thank you and good night.

1072
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,229
What?

1073
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,040
<i>Thank you.
Tony White showing you a new flower trick</i>

1074
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,156
<i>and also his distinctive ring piece.</i>

1075
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,913
<i>Don't worry. Whoosh!
Right over the kids' heads.</i>

1076
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,389
<i>Anyhow, next up,
it's Karl Allen, Mind Monger.</i>

1077
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,593
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1078
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,831
I am about to take you on a journey
into the mind,

1079
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:19,278
a journey travelling by brain,
as we make contact with the other side.

1080
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,752
He's not doing medium, is he?

1081
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:27,153
I shall cast the spirit sphere
at total random into the sea of brains.

1082
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,879
Jason?

1083
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,515
It is Jason, isn't it?

1084
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,271
Me? Yes. I can't believe it.

1085
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,395
Jason, I'm sensing that
you've recently lost someone. Am I right?

1086
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,711
Yeah. Yeah, a friend of mine, Peter.
I can't believe it.

1087
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,957
I believe Peter has something
he would like to say to you,

1088
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:03,352
so, please, join me on stage,
as I penetrate the ectoplasm.

1089
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,794
Are you all right?

1090
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,235
Hello? Are...

1091
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,239
Is this part of it?

1092
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,951
Give me a sign if this is part of it.

1093
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,189
Bollocks.

1094
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:39,031
So, sir, Jason, please...

1095
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,911
He's off, mate. He's concussed.

1096
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,799
The human mind, and... Good.

1097
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,670
So, I will now search
the spirit zone for another.

1098
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,389
Is...

1099
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:59,350
Is there a John in tonight?

1100
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,237
A Mr John something?

1101
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,674
Seriously, no Johns?

1102
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,950
Show us some magic!
- Yeah, throw us your magic ball!

1103
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,792
Throw it!
- Over here, mate!

1104
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,476
Yes, indeed, let us use the spirits
to find another subject.

1105
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,238
Thank you, madam.

1106
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:31,393
So, tell me, have you ever lost anyone?

1107
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,118
Yes. Yes, I have.

1108
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,235
Excellent.

1109
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,036
Den, he died, and...

1110
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,829
He was killed.
A van hit him two months ago.

1111
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,230
Is he... What's happened?
Does he need to speak to me?

1112
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,395
Is he all right? Can I speak to him?

1113
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,517
He was trying to say something,
but the ventilator was so loud that...

1114
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,830
Can you tell him I miss him? Very much.

1115
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,194
Yes.

1116
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,996
Yes, I'm sure you do, and I wish I could help

1117
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,514
bring you and your companion
back together, but...

1118
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,036
I'm sorry. The truth is, I can't.

1119
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,595
And anybody who says they can is a liar.

1120
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,633
There is no spirit realm.
There is no ectoplasm.

1121
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,631
The whole thing's bollocks.

1122
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,199
Courteney Cox!

1123
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,238
Psychics are either cynical careerists,

1124
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:41,996
or, if you look at them
in the best possible light, deluded schizos.

1125
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,233
Courteney bloody Cox!

1126
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,038
Sorry. Good night.

1127
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,638
Take his name off the list
for the finalists' carvery.

1128
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,995
No pork loin for that fucker.

1129
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,639
<i>Would the Remarkable Carringtons</i>

1130
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,517
<i>make their way to the stage, please?</i>

1131
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,794
Oh, my God, Karl! I just saw.
What the hell was that? I just kept thinking,

1132
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:17,156
"He's just so going to turn this around
and do something,

1133
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:21,756
"you know, completely amazing out there."
You just totally didn't.

1134
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,593
- You're so out!
- Yeah.

1135
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,830
Yeah, I guess it's looking pretty good
for me and Harry.

1136
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,230
- Anyway, look, I'll see you later.
- Linda, listen...

1137
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:35,110
Just make sure when you're on stage,
double check. Triple check.

1138
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,156
Oh, it's fine. It's fine.
We've done it, like, a thousand times.

1139
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,196
I mean, Harry's doing
the Gresham finish or something, anyway.

1140
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,078
Seriously, Linda, you don't know
what he's capable of.

1141
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:46,119
I heard you earlier. You goaded him.
You indulged in goading.

1142
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,629
Carol thought it was all going to be fine.

1143
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,072
<i>Mandy Pandy
and her Flags of the World there,</i>

1144
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,559
<i>an act with a message.</i>

1145
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,198
<i>Okay, it's not going to end
the AIDS pandemic,</i>

1146
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,714
<i>but maybe, just maybe, it's a start.</i>

1147
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,798
Harry! Stop that!

1148
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,668
I'll bang my head if I want to, Karl.
You can't stop me.

1149
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,551
Listen, Harry,
I just wanted to say about Linda,

1150
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,189
you do know all the stuff that Tony was
saying about sleeping with her was bullshit.

1151
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,349
It was just sledging.

1152
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,317
Oh, sure. Karl, why are you even...

1153
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,231
Really. I saw them in the bar that night.

1154
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,038
They had one drink,
and then she went back to her room

1155
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,997
and Tony stayed, trying it on with everyone.

1156
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,071
<i>Even Crying Game Violet.</i>

1157
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:43,392
But Linda said it was true.
Why would she say something like that?

1158
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,914
She was probably just trying to
get a reaction, Harry. You know,

1159
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,151
poking the husk with a stick,
seeing if there's any juice in it.

1160
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,714
Anyway, I'm just saying
don't be angry with her,

1161
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,677
and please, don't murder her.

1162
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,315
You what?

1163
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,879
Well, the last time
you thought your assistant

1164
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,871
had been unfaithful to you,
you murdered her,

1165
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,758
so I'm saying this one wasn't,
so don't murder her.

1166
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,994
I don't believe it! You actually think I...

1167
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,877
Is this why you've never apologised
for Carol and you?

1168
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,394
Well, why should I apologise
to the murderer?

1169
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,675
I didn't murder her, all right?

1170
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,796
Of course you did!
You cut her bloody head off!

1171
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,474
- I didn't mean to!
- Okay, fine. Prove it.

1172
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,835
- I can't prove it!
- Exactly.

1173
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,229
<i>and Linda to the stage.</i>

1174
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,231
<i>Harry Kane and Linda to the stage, please.</i>

1175
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,756
All I'm saying is that
this is me you're talking to, Harry,

1176
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,308
who you've known since you were 13,

1177
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,870
and do you really, really think
that I could murder someone?

1178
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,269
Me? Actually do a murder?

1179
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,591
Or do you think maybe it's just a bit easier
for you to think that I'm a murderer

1180
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,798
than to face up to all the guilt
for having screwed your best friend's wife?

1181
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,429
<i>Now our final performance</i>

1182
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,479
<i>is from another of the Magic Table's
favourite sons, Harry Kane,</i>

1183
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,951
<i>or as he now apparently revels
in being known, the Black Widower.</i>

1184
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,556
<i>to the Black Widower's lair.</i>

1185
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,029
<i>He dwells in a world of pain and fear,</i>

1186
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,669
<i>with the stench of death always near.</i>

1187
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,279
<i>But before you breathe your final breath,
he'll taunt you</i>

1188
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,999
<i>with the Balls Of Death!</i>

1189
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,750
Is that taunting?
Does that ball work constitute taunting?

1190
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:49,470
<i>And now, the final hour is here.</i>

1191
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:54,315
<i>Who will face the Blade of Fear?</i>

1192
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,358
This is sick.

1193
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,509
This is so sick
it might actually make the papers.

1194
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,793
Harry. Harry, I'm just not sure
if we did enough...

1195
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,074
Shall we check again?
Did we do enough checks?

1196
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,151
Of course I did enough checks.

1197
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,639
I just... I'm sorry.

1198
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,633
Linda, it's... We've got to...

1199
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,029
- It's time to...
- Yeah. I just...

1200
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,669
I'm...

1201
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,709
I'm sorry. Harry, I can't.

1202
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,637
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1203
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,153
What's she playing at?
He only did it wrong once, love!

1204
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:18,909
Well, I...

1205
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:24,319
This is unexpected and... Shit.

1206
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,039
I don't suppose anyone else
would be willing to...

1207
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,760
No. No. Naturally, of course.

1208
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,315
- Well, all remains is for me to say...
- Black Widower.

1209
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,789
I'll face the Blade of Fear.

1210
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,996
- Is this some kind of horrible joke?
- Harry, I believe you.

1211
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,355
Tell them to put the music back on.

1212
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,637
And I'm sorry for the time me and Carol...

1213
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,438
That was wrong.

1214
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,360
So, it's the Gresham finish,
using a trap, right?

1215
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,999
So are we okay now, Harry?

1216
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,878
Or are you still, you know,
angry with me at all?

1217
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,552
Because that would be
perfectly understandable,

1218
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,949
but, you know, I did apologise.

1219
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:16,828
And just so you know,

1220
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,753
what you think happened
between me and Carol didn't really happen.

1221
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,149
I mean, we did do things but just...

1222
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:26,392
Well, I don't want to go into too much detail,
but, you know, she demanded satisfaction.

1223
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,029
Sorry, I've probably said too much,
but, you know, the implication's clear.

1224
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,190
She made me go down on her.

1225
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,993
Plus, I think you should know,
I resisted her for years.

1226
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,832
I mean, she was trying it on
at your wedding reception.

1227
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,194
I was, like, "No way."

1228
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,515
You're not taking this badly, are you?

1229
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,510
I mean, you know,
I was by no means the first.

1230
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,478
There are a lot of people
you should be angrier with than me.

1231
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,437
I mean, they were queuing up.

1232
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,670
I mean, everyone said she gave great head.

1233
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,271
Look, look, I think I've made the gesture
coming out here,

1234
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:01,559
but now, maybe, maybe you should do it
with a cabbage. Yeah? Mate?

1235
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,791
Oh, shit!

1236
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,150
Oh, God. No.

1237
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,678
No. No!

1238
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,674
Come on!

1239
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:10,194
<i>Well, I don't think that anyone
has ever seen a final quite like that,</i>

1240
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,238
<i>and I do not, in any way,
mean that in a positive sense.</i>

1241
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,069
<i>So, the Magic Table Special
Innovation Award</i>

1242
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,515
<i>goes to Tony White for his flower trick!</i>

1243
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,068
Yes! Yes! Yes! Fucking yes!

1244
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,790
<i>Mike, Lenny, Jimbo,
I thought you were just arseholes,</i>

1245
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,156
<i>but, you know what?
You're not just arseholes.</i>

1246
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,639
<i>Thank you.</i>

1247
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,311
<i>And so, to the ultimate Shieldist.</i>

1248
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,276
<i>And it is over my objections,
because, seriously, was that good,</i>

1249
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,874
<i>or was it just a massive cock-up
quite well disguised?</i>

1250
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,154
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

1251
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:53,710
<i>It's congratulations
to the Black Widower, Harry Kane!</i>

1252
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,436
<i>Thank you, Mike,
and I just want to dedicate this award</i>

1253
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,796
<i>to the man who got me into magic,
Karl Allen,</i>

1254
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,553
<i>who dug me out of a hole tonight.</i>

1255
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:17,473
<i>And I'd just like to say
that there's someone else</i>

1256
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,393
<i>who should be receiving this award with me,</i>

1257
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:24,758
<i>the assistant who got me
into the final in the first place, Linda.</i>

1258
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:30,599
<i>Yes, come on up here, Linda,
because you deserve to be up here,</i>

1259
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,510
<i>and because... Because...</i>

1260
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,831
<i>The truth is, I...</i>

1261
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,749
<i>I love you.</i>

1262
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,036
<i>I love you, Linda Jones.</i>

1263
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,153
I'm so sorry for walking out on you, Harry.

1264
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:02,119
Listen, Linda, I just wanted to say
I don't actually love you, not yet.

1265
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:05,078
It just seemed like that's what I needed
to say to get you to come up here.

1266
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,798
I mean, I like you, a lot.

1267
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:11,476
I expect, in time, I'll come
to call those feelings love. It's just...

1268
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,749
I'm sensing.

1269
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:04,550
Yeah, I'm sensing a spirit trying to send
a message to someone in this room.

1270
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,798
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

1271
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:13,835
Is there anyone here who's female,
under 25, and recently had a break-up?

1272
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,912
Okay, okay, let's spread the net a bit wider.

1273
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,833
Are there any other ladies here,
sort of 25 to 30,

1274
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,990
having a tough time, on a rebound?

1275
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:28,835
Yeah, you. Yes, definitely you.
I've got a message for you.

1276
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,875
Okay, Karl?
I know you're playing in Blackpool tonight,

1277
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,997
and guess what? I'm in the sand, Karl.

1278
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,230
I'm buried up to the neck in sand.

1279
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,470
And the tide's coming in, that's right.

1280
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,676
So are you gonna come and dig me out?
'Cause I'm not doing it myself.

1281
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,235
Come on, Karl. Come get me.

1282
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,357
Really hope you get this message.
