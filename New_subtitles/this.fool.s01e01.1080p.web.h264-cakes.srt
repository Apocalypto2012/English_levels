1
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:23,982
Julio!

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,907
It doesn't look like it's gonna rain.

3
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,385
Julio!

4
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,311
- Julio!
- Chinga su madre.

5
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,903
I know.

6
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,225
- Come on now. Right there.
- Right there, man.

7
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,434
Yeah, man.

8
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,645
- You got him.
- Hey!

9
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,148
My bad to interrupt
but do you fools mind moving your car?

10
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,440
I'm a little late for work.

11
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,024
Bad timing. We're in the middle
of an important race right now.

12
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,678
Yeah, it's Black versus Mexicans.

13
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,614
Hey, I'm Salvadorian.

14
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,515
Damn, all sensitive.

15
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,396
You know what? I think I got room.

16
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,481
I used to valet.

17
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,209
Fuck!

18
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,335
I wasn't a valet.

19
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,903
Why the fuck did I say that?

20
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,244
I got this.

21
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,750
You got it, you got it, you got it.
You got it.

22
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,466
You know what? I'll just go around.

23
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,951
- Ooh.
- What the fuck is he doing?

24
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,978
Ooh! He got the little white fence!

25
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,105
What the fuck?

26
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:31,610
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

27
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,548
- Ooh.
- Oh, shit.

28
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,366
Hey, good lookin' out, fellas.

29
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,786
At Hugs Not Thugs, you get a second chance

30
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,603
to decide who you want to be.

31
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,165
Whether you're a former gang member

32
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,084
or previously incarcerated,

33
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:15,070
we offer the resources you need
to transform your life.

34
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:19,616
The system may have left you behind,
but we're here for you.

35
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:23,346
And we're proud to say
we remove more tattoos

36
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,289
than anyone else in Los Angeles.

37
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,919
Hey, big dawg, we can wipe away
that teardrop tattoo, no problem.

38
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,358
Look, check it out,
we offer free legal counseling,

39
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,777
solar panel installation classes.

40
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,636
Oh, and here's the founder.

41
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,365
Hey, Minister Payne.

42
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,576
This is Fabian.
He's thinking about joining the program.

43
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,035
What's up, big dawg?

44
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,746
"What's up" is we just found out
Sir Richard Branson

45
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,876
is making a generous donation
in the amount of $10,000.

46
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,502
Oh, good.

47
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,172
Cheapskate motherfucker
spends billions of dollars

48
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,631
going up into space,

49
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,200
barely gives us enough money
for making rent.

50
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,304
Richard, please, throw down
a few more pennies

51
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,889
from the troposphere.

52
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,557
Astronaut son of a bitch!

53
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,517
Very nice to meet you, Fabian.

54
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,542
Welcome.

55
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,921
Space Knight motherfucker!

56
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,483
That fool's a minister?

57
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,652
He's a Unitarian Universalist.

58
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,803
Those fools are like hippies but angry.

59
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,348
Oh, yeah, can't believe
I forgot to mention.

60
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,266
As a bonus for signing up,

61
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,019
all new Huggers get a free mug.

62
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,430
So what do you say, big dawg?

63
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,037
Ready to make a better life for yourself?

64
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,837
Imma be honest with you.

65
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,696
I don't think this shit's for me, bro.

66
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,133
Listen, I get it, big dawg.

67
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,718
I know what the street life is like.

68
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,553
What you know about street life?

69
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,181
You look like you got
a season pass to Disneyland.

70
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,683
Nah, fool, I grew up in these streets.

71
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,793
And believe me, I've seen some shit.

72
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,193
I was cruising through the neighborhood
on my new wheels,

73
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,804
just chillin',
when all of a sudden this car pulled up.

74
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,560
But I didn't panic.

75
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,855
I instinctively maneuvered out of the way.

76
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,607
My homie Brian was there.

77
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,628
So I asked him, "What's going on?"

78
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:22,614
And he tells me,
"Your cousin's drug deal went awry."

79
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,290
Oh, shit, Julio?

80
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,625
What's crackin'?

81
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,461
'Sup, Luis? Just chillin'.

82
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,565
Kinda scared.

83
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,316
Are you fucking roller skating?

84
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,986
Well, it's actually
aggressive roller blading.

85
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,179
Damn, fool,
somehow that sounds even gayer.

86
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,991
Hey, say hi to my tía for me, alright?

87
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,434
And don't give her any problems
or I'll beat your ass.

88
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,978
Okay, I won't.

89
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:56,064
And then I said,
"Thanks for not shooting me!"

90
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,043
Hey, no offense, my boy,

91
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,921
but you come off
like a punk-ass bitch in that story.

92
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,214
That's my point.

93
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,134
My cousin spent
the last eight years in prison.

94
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:09,179
Meanwhile, I'm out here
living my best life.

95
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,055
I even got dental insurance.

96
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,141
Look. Check it out.

97
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,392
Get in here.

98
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,627
Man, your teeth still look
pretty fucked up, though.

99
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,813
Yeah, but guess what?

100
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,380
They used to be even more fucked up.

101
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,692
Look, you're gonna do
what you're gonna do.

102
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,820
But studies show
that the life expectancy of a gangster,

103
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,305
on average, 24 years old.

104
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,642
But the life expectancy
of a punk-ass bitch?

105
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,019
76 years old.

106
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,586
Orientation is at 10:00 tomorrow.

107
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,046
Don't be late.

108
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,270
There's gonna be orange juice.

109
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,664
Maggie?

110
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,107
- Oh, hey, Julio, what's up?
- You need something?

111
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,651
Did you just steal my car?

112
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:05,819
Excuse me?

113
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,278
Don't use that word with me.

114
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,907
My car broke down,
so I borrowed yours to run errands.

115
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,158
I'll bring it back tonight, beggar.

116
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,285
When did I say you could borrow my car?

117
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,829
Remember when you left
your spare key at my house

118
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,789
- that one time on accident?
- Yeah?

119
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,582
Then do the math, bitch.

120
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,460
Oh, by the way,
your check engine light is on.

121
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,362
Julio, that's dangerous.
I should be the one who is mad.

122
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,573
You know what, actually?

123
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,344
How fucking dare you?
You put me in danger.

124
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,429
Why the fuck would you do that to me?

125
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,497
- Well, bring it back then.
- I gotta pick up Luis.

126
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,767
No shit.

127
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,561
They're letting your cousin out?

128
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,729
Man, the prison system is stupid.

129
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,006
Actually, he's gonna
stay with us for a while.

130
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,109
Imma help that fool get his life together.

131
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,509
Take that fool under my wing.

132
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,447
You know, Julio,
you really are the nicest ex I have.

133
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,701
That's why I thought
you'd be cool if I borrowed your car.

134
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,703
But if you want me
to bring it back, that's fine.

135
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:57,954
Thank you.

136
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,622
I'll just call another ex.

137
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,648
Maybe Carlos.

138
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,817
We're talking again.

139
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,799
The Black man is the original man.

140
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:13,911
And Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans
are all our children.

141
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,723
Now some of you make me proud,

142
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,933
but some of you are not men.

143
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,144
You may have the body of a man,

144
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,212
but possess a child's will.

145
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,380
Stand up for the word of the Lord.

146
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,341
A storm is comin'!

147
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,662
Sorry I'm late!

148
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,848
Damn, you run slow.

149
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,791
You should have brought
your roller skates.

150
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,709
They were roller blades.

151
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,711
It's different.

152
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,990
So... where's your ride at, primo?

153
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,683
I let my home girl borrow it.

154
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,662
But don't worry, I got you.

155
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,247
I'll call us an Uber.

156
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,040
Uber is like the taxi of the future.

157
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,625
Uber is like the taxi of the future.

158
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,168
I know what Uber is, pendejo.

159
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,902
Eh, talking to me like that.

160
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,554
Actually, they have Uber in prison.

161
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,093
Yeah. His name is Thumper.

162
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,887
And if you give him a pack of cigarettes,
he'll carry you around, like, hey.

163
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:38,912
It's pretty convenient.

164
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,790
Damn, my boy.
I haven't seen you forever.

165
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,810
Hey, for real though,

166
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,645
why does your body still look 19

167
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,481
but your face looks 56, fool?

168
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,066
Yup.

169
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,176
You got Edward James Olmos' face.

170
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,072
Welcome back, fool. I missed you too.

171
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,097
Ehh.

172
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,474
Don't be nasty, alright? We're family.

173
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,305
I don't get down like that.

174
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,937
Cool. Yeah. Okay.

175
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,991
I'm gonna beat your ass, Michael!

176
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,100
- Hey, hey, Aiden.
- Come here.

177
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,205
Gotta be more careful, alright?

178
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,499
You almost just broke
this photo of me and my mom.

179
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:50,043
I'm gonna forgive you
because you're a little homie.

180
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,362
But if this was a level four yard,
I would've stabbed you.

181
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,673
You understand?

182
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,008
Yeah.

183
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,384
Okay.

184
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,012
Now, come here. Give me a hug.
I'm your tío Luis, alright?

185
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,371
I love you, mijo.

186
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,506
Julio. Julio!

187
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,036
Eh, who let
the Mexican Oompa Loompa in here, huh?

188
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,270
Oompa!

189
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,067
Hey, what's up with that tarp
I saw on the roof?

190
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,776
Yeah, teach his ass.

191
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,760
This fool can't even build Legos.

192
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,531
It's the least I could do to repay you.

193
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,882
Actually, I have some exciting news.

194
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,592
I've kinda become a big deal
at Hugs Not Thugs

195
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:24,328
which is now the fifth largest
gang rehabilitation center in Los Angeles.

196
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:28,183
Anyway, I pulled a few strings
and I was able to get Luis a spot.

197
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,810
Imma be your case manager,
help you find a new career.

198
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,170
You can case manage these nuts, homie.

199
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,942
Yeah, Julio, you're the one
who needs to get your life together.

200
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,945
Like, you waste all your money
buying dumb-ass comic books

201
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,780
and I literally saw CDs in your room.

202
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,700
Like, who the fuck pays for music, idiot?

203
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,452
I like physical media.

204
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,579
Yeah, Mom, how come
you let him stay here for free?

205
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,123
You made me start paying rent
after my quinceañera.

206
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,233
You made me pay for my quinceañera.

207
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,175
Ah, nah, don't worry about me, tía.

208
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,801
I can find a job on my own.

209
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,953
Plus, I just got out, you know,
I wanna kick it first.

210
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:23,321
Hmm. So I guess
if he wants to stay here,

211
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,764
then he has to join Hugs Not Thugs.

212
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,088
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.

213
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:04,344
Where's your ride at?

214
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,489
You took my car to San Diego?

215
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,449
I thought you needed
to run a few errands.

216
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,618
People can run errands in San Diego.

217
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,370
Don't be racist.

218
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,664
What the fuck kind of errands
are you running in San Diego?

219
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,332
None of your business
what kind of errands.

220
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,109
Always so nosy.
Respect my boundaries. Bye.

221
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,553
- She's your ex?
- Ah, she's using you, bro.

222
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,180
Look at it closely.

223
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,539
We still hook up. Sometimes.

224
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:36,251
Hey. Doesn't that make
your boyfriend jealous?

225
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,836
I feel for him.

226
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,734
You should all be proud

227
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,652
to be sitting here today,

228
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,113
mainly because it means
you've escaped

229
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:51,117
the corrupt for-profit
prison industrial complex

230
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:54,603
put in place
by our racist, classist government.

231
00:14:56,313 --> 00:15:00,001
But also because
you've taken the first step

232
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:03,046
towards gaining control of your life.

233
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,300
Now, the second step is a test

234
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:10,410
of great spiritual and mental fortitude.

235
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,913
You must bake

236
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,100
a delicious cupcake.

237
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,061
What? What?

238
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,146
Yo. Julio, what the fuck, man?

239
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,690
Thought you said I'd be designing
solar panels and shit.

240
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,026
Hey, dawg, the only way
we can afford that program

241
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,029
is by selling these cupcakes
to local supermarkets.

242
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,615
People love buying cupcakes
from ex-gang members.

243
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,450
The only nonprofit that sells

244
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,410
more sweets than us
are the Girl Scouts.

245
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:38,206
If the Girl Scouts ever start
getting face tattoos, we're fucked.

246
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,708
Hey, this is like
some exploitation shit.

247
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,234
It's like prison labor, homies.

248
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,111
We ought a unionize.

249
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:51,326
Shut the fuck up!

250
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,641
Now I know why you bitches
don't wanna bake cupcakes.

251
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,168
See, it ain't got nothing to do
with the pink apron.

252
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,670
It's 'cause deep down inside,

253
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,423
you motherfuckers is afraid to fail.

254
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,884
'Cause this ain't your world.

255
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,760
This is my world.

256
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,596
Cupcake world.

257
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:14,701
I'm a cupcake girl in a cupcake world.

258
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:19,271
And you will not come in here
and disrespect my cupcake world.

259
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,523
Bitch.

260
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,170
Thank you, Chef Percy Williams.

261
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,005
He started out just like all of you

262
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,965
then he went through our culinary program,

263
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:33,452
and now he is
a gourmet pastry chef at Sprinkles.

264
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,930
Well, I'll fuck with some Sprinkles.

265
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,165
A'ight, now enough of this bullshit.

266
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,626
Let's get our bake on.

267
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,205
Hey.

268
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:19,748
Why'd you bounce?

269
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,835
Dawg, that cupcake shit
is embarrassing, alright?

270
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,962
That's stuff my mom used to do.

271
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,941
What's next, you want me to
knit you a sweater or what?

272
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,400
It's called art therapy,

273
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,653
and that's on your schedule
for 2:30 today.

274
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,238
And actually, it's really fun.

275
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:35,198
Damn, you're moody.

276
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,741
You on the rag or what?

277
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,368
Oh, shit, fool, you're pregnant?

278
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,702
Can I touch the baby?

279
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,912
Aye, Mira, look, it's kicking.

280
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,271
Uh! Unh. Uh-huh!

281
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,291
You're fucking ignorant.

282
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,126
It's not 2005.

283
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,045
Tobey Maguire ain't Spider-Man anymore.

284
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:53,657
It'll always be
2005 up here, my boy!

285
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:59,264
Listen, if you can't even
bake me a cupcake,

286
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,640
I'm gonna have to cut you loose.

287
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,059
Then you have to move out of my house.

288
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,918
Tough love, playboy.

289
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:45,268
Hey, fool, when you're done
with that gay Captain Planet shit,

290
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,002
I can teach you how to do some man shit.

291
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:48,938
How's recycling gay?

292
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,465
- Don't play stupid, alright?
- You know why.

293
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,615
Damn, now I'm feeling
all energized and shit.

294
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,241
Where do you keep the weights at?

295
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,517
I wanna work out.

296
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,953
I don't have any weights.

297
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,854
I mostly just run for exercise.

298
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,317
No wonder your torta ex-lady
always steals your car.

299
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,032
Come on, pick up the pace.

300
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:20,178
You don't get all swole
from making cupcakes.

301
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,138
It's fucking heavy!

302
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,349
- Hey, liquids ain't heavy.
- It's just water.

303
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,059
Damn, you still got
a lot to learn from me.

304
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,061
You're like a little kid still.

305
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,855
Maybe I'm the one
that should be your caseworker.

306
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,172
Fuck this. I'm done!

307
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,101
- Nah, nah, nah.
- You just need to cool off.

308
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,303
Here.

309
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:40,848
Toma!

310
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,795
Hey, Luis.

311
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,946
I wanna apologize.

312
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:59,175
I went too hard on you
about the cupcakes yesterday.

313
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,719
The important thing is,
is that you're trying your best.

314
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,096
It tasted good, huh?

315
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,663
Oh, yeah.

316
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,418
- Just in case your best isn't...
- the best.

317
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:24,766
You are all disgusting wet batter.

318
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:28,246
But out of that disgusting wet batter

319
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,647
can rise a beautiful cupcake.

320
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,568
You just have to figure out
what your motivation is.

321
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:38,488
Maybe you're doing this
for somebody you love.

322
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,701
Or maybe you're just
doing it out of spite.

323
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,973
Hell, most good things in this world
was done out of spite.

324
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:50,626
America started out of spite
for the fuckin' Brits.

325
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:55,589
Pepsi started out of spite
for motherfuckin' Coca-Cola.

326
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,841
Sprite,

327
00:20:58,884 --> 00:20:59,885
spite!

328
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:03,430
You have the power
to make a difference in this world.

329
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,784
Whoa! All this motivational speaking
is making me thirsty!

330
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:07,911
Goddamn!

331
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,103
Yo, somebody give me some damn Sprite!

332
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,507
Hey, chef.

333
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:21,657
I'm done over here.

334
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:23,575
Don't worry, chef.

335
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,869
I'll taste test it.

336
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:29,349
Yeah, well, this shit's
gonna be bomb, homie.

337
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:30,624
Trust that.

338
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,153
Hmm. I don't know.

339
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,846
I taste a lot of thug in this.

340
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:45,973
But not a lot of hug.

341
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,225
Guess you better try again.

342
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:52,831
- You fucking liar.
- Hey, dawg,

343
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:56,024
we just have a really
high standard for cupcakes here.

344
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:59,611
Making cupcakes ain't no cakewalk.

345
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,282
Man, fuck you
and fuck your cupcakes.

346
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,260
Gay boy.

347
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:07,077
Gay boy? Are you for real?

348
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:10,098
Nobody finds that shit funny anymore,
dumb-ass.

349
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:12,642
This motherfucker
got that 10th grade ignorance.

350
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,418
It's not 2005 no more.

351
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,521
Man, fuck you. Fuck all you fools.

352
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,088
I'm done with this stupid-ass program.

353
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:20,650
That's what I get for being nice
and trying to help your ass.

354
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,986
You know what? I can smell
that nice guy bullshit a mile away.

355
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,612
You don't give a fuck about me.

356
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:27,157
Why don't you drop the fake shit
and swing on me, perro, huh?

357
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:28,658
I know you want to. Come on, bitch.

358
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:31,143
Hit me with your best shot,
you fucking pussy.

359
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,037
Alright, fine.

360
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:35,165
When your mom got sick,
you weren't there for her

361
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,482
because you were in prison
for doing dumb shit.

362
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,285
This fool's coldblooded.

363
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:51,788
Hey, don't ever tell this fool
nothing about your life.

364
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:54,666
Fuck me.

365
00:22:58,504 --> 00:22:59,814
Mm!

366
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,840
Now, that is one delicious cupcake.

367
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,652
Why did you lie to your poor cousin?

368
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,446
Look, I'm just trying to help his ass.

369
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,031
But that fool won't listen to me.

370
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,074
He still sees me as a little kid.

371
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,285
Julio, did I ever tell you
about the worst thing

372
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:13,786
I've ever done in my life?

373
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,663
- Well, yeah.
- The documentary you made

374
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,940
about the annual ping-pong tournament
on skid row.

375
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:20,275
No.

376
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:26,049
I'm talking about when I worked for a bank
foreclosing on people's homes.

377
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,550
You didn't like my doc?

378
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,535
No, no, no, no, no. I like it.

379
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:32,764
I thought it was really sad,

380
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:34,706
and that's how I knew it was good.

381
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,129
But anyway, what were you saying
about the bank?

382
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,814
Well, I was so ashamed
at what I was doing

383
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:42,357
that I quit my lucrative job

384
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:46,820
and I moved by myself
to a remote village in Venezuela

385
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:49,322
that had been devastated by mudslides.

386
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,991
I spent six months
rebuilding people's homes.

387
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,827
My hands are covered in blisters,

388
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:55,787
my body was full of bruises.

389
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:59,189
I caught this intestinal parasite
that I think is still with me.

390
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,150
But I never felt so happy.

391
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:04,403
I never felt so fulfilled.

392
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:10,576
And then one day,
every single house that I built fell down.

393
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,830
Because I had no idea how to build houses.

394
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,418
But I knew how to make pizza.

395
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:24,089
I made so much pizza,
they called me Hombre Pizza.

396
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:28,778
Unfortunately, it turned out
that everybody in the village

397
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:32,055
was lactose intolerant, so, um...

398
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:35,267
I was asked to leave.

399
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,788
So you never got to help them, huh?

400
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,499
No, but I learned
something very important.

401
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:44,502
You see, I have a bad habit of focusing

402
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:47,297
on other people's problems
while ignoring my own.

403
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,489
And I think you might have
that same problem.

404
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,661
You know... just to say it,

405
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:57,372
I think the only issue I had with the doc

406
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,851
was the soundtrack.

407
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,562
Yeah, it had way more flute
than I'm used to.

408
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:03,730
But you know what?

409
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:06,316
Some of my favorite movies,
I hated the first time.

410
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,343
Get the hell outta here
and go apologize to your cousin.

411
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:11,553
- You're right.
- I like flute.

412
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:14,073
- Okay.
- You try making a fuckin' movie.

413
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,224
Sorry.

414
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:25,859
You're welcome, by the way.

415
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:28,922
I'm welcome? You're the one
who should be fuckin' welcome.

416
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:30,298
This is my car.

417
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:32,967
- We've had sex in the backseat.
- It's our car.

418
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:36,095
Imma start a GoFundMe
to buy you a new Nissan Altima.

419
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,931
- I want my key back.
- Okay, okay, okay.

420
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:39,122
Jeez, I'm sorry.

421
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,519
But maybe the reason
I borrowed your car was...

422
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,854
Stole my car,
committed a felony, really.

423
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,648
I wanted a reason to hang out with you.

424
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:48,274
You never hang out with me anymore.

425
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:51,301
- We broke up!
- Yeah, like months ago. Get over it.

426
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,031
You only wanna hang out
when you want something from me.

427
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,950
Oh-ho-ho. Like how you
only wanna hang out

428
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:58,100
when you wanna smash?

429
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,104
Yup, exactly like that.

430
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:03,981
Hmm.

431
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:06,876
But for real,
if you pull this shit again,

432
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,944
I'm not letting you
come over for Christmas.

433
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,465
Julio Miguel Bonifacio Lopez De La Riva,

434
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,342
if you take your family away from me

435
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:15,844
and make me go back to mine,

436
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,929
I will beat your ass!

437
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:19,556
I'm gonna slide down the chimney

438
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,308
and I'm gonna choke you out so hard
you're gonna come out your eyes.

439
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:25,019
Jesus Christ! What's wrong with you?

440
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,521
What's wrong with you?

441
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:27,629
You like it.

442
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:30,174
Yo, pull over.

443
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:41,703
So you're stalking me now?

444
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:44,021
- You know it.
- Give me some chon-chon.

445
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:49,026
You know, it's funny.

446
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:51,653
One time right over there,

447
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:55,574
me and the homies robbed
these nerdy-ass rocker fools.

448
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:57,993
That was me and my friends.

449
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:03,165
Yeah. Those were good times.

450
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:05,876
Fuck.

451
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,481
- I was lying about your cupcakes.
- They were bomb.

452
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:11,441
And I shouldn't have said
what I said about your mom.

453
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:12,692
I miss her too.

454
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,636
- Nah, nah, nah, it's cool, alright?
- It's cool.

455
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:16,386
We were throwing down.

456
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,031
I've been shot three times,

457
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:19,495
it hurt less than the shit you said.

458
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,851
You throw punches with your sick-ass mind.

459
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,330
I don't know,
I guess I've been pissed at you

460
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:26,873
'cause you just keep capping on me.

461
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,148
Alright, I'm sorry, homie.

462
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,818
I'm sorry, alright?
Damn.

463
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:33,737
It's just, you know,

464
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,218
calling you gay was the only thing

465
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:40,327
that's made me feel like
shit's back to normal.

466
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:42,347
But shit's changed, fool.

467
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:43,765
I'm a grown-ass man.

468
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:45,141
I even got dental insurance.

469
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,727
Yeah, but you still live
at your mom's pad, alright?

470
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,395
Same place as me, homie.

471
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:50,730
Yeah, but...

472
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:51,755
No, yeah.

473
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,401
And your teeth are pretty fucked up.

474
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:56,705
I still got more appointments!

475
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:59,113
Get in the car, losers.

476
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:01,181
Sorry, there's only one bitch seat.

477
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:04,077
Damn, I thought for sure
you'd be a torta.

478
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:05,769
Hey, fool, hook me up.

479
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,831
Hey, Luis,

480
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,707
shut the fuck up before I fuck you up.

481
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,400
I'm not Julio. You ain't my family.

482
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:16,798
Hey, y'all ain't got nothing.

483
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:18,550
- You don't got me.
- You ain't got nothin', man.

484
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:19,717
You gotta get your money from me, boy.

485
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:20,951
Yo, I got $20.

486
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:22,703
Goddamn it.

487
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,181
You want me to talk to these busters?

488
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,957
No. I got this.

489
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:29,885
Alright, then, fool,
we'll wait in the car.

490
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,963
Ooh, ooh, ooh. I'm gonna film this.

491
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:35,900
Hey! I'm gonna need
you fellas to move your car.

492
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:38,051
Damn, bruh,
but we're kinda racing right now.

493
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:41,364
Last time it was
Blacks versus the Mexicans,

494
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:43,599
this time it's Mexicans versus Blacks.

495
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,493
Dawg, I'm Salvadoran.

496
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:46,703
Man, we talked about this.

497
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,312
Move your fucking car!

498
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,040
Whoa, bro.

499
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:52,167
Watch your tone.

500
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:53,626
We don't play like that.

501
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,003
You wanna die, homie?

502
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:57,797
Yes! Please! Kill me, bitch!

503
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,323
I don't live to live!

504
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:01,759
What?

505
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,970
I'd rather die
than let you fools walk all over me.

506
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:05,138
Because that's my thing!

507
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:08,558
I focus on other people's problems
to avoid dealing with my own.

508
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:11,769
I definitely got some codependency issues
going on with my ex-lady.

509
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:12,937
Hey!

510
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,838
Do you fools even know
what codependency is?

511
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,925
I just read about that shit. It sucks!

512
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:21,196
I got a lot of work to do on myself
and I don't wanna do it!

513
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,572
So just shoot me, please!

514
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:24,473
Whoa, fool, chill.

515
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:26,951
We don't even have guns.

516
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:28,703
Then choke me, bitch.

517
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:30,330
I hope you don't have lawyer hands

518
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:31,956
because I also got a fat neck,

519
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,209
which is something else
I'm insecure about.

520
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:35,418
Kill me. Do it.

521
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:37,170
What the fuck is this fool doing?

522
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:39,655
I don't know but it's turning me on.

523
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:45,994
Hey!

524
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:26,952
Next time you fools better kill me.

525
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:31,474
