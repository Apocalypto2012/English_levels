1
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:18,828
How does one come
to know the unknowable?

2
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,873
"What faculties must a man possess?

3
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,833
"Since it was discovered that whale oil

4
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,337
"could light our cities
in ways never achieved before,

5
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,589
"it created global demand.

6
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:33,301
"It has pushed man to venture
further and further

7
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:36,513
"into the deep blue unknown.

8
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:38,598
"We know not its depths,

9
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,643
"nor the host of creatures
that live there.

10
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,353
"Monsters.

11
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:44,688
"Are they real?

12
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:59,536
"Or do the stories exist only to make us
respect the sea's dark secrets?

13
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,927
"The question both vexes and excites me

14
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:17,804
"and is the reason
I've written you a second time

15
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,723
"to request a meeting.

16
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:22,100
"A conversation with you, sir,
I believe will serve me well

17
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:23,893
"for the novel I intend to write,

18
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:27,063
"currently entitled Moby Dick.

19
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,984
"I hope you will reconsider my offer.

20
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:33,320
"The unknown.

21
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,990
"That is where my imagination
yearns to venture.

22
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:41,369
"And so the question plagues me still.

23
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,831
"How does a man come to know
the unknowable?

24
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:48,084
"Sincerely, Herman Melville."

25
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,171
We're closed.

26
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:53,256
No boarders after 8:00.

27
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:05,935
You came.

28
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:17,447
Someone here for you, my love.

29
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:18,782
Tom Nickerson?

30
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,286
Herman Melville.

31
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,789
We received your letter.

32
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:28,249
You're either a desperate man

33
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,877
or a fool to come
all the way to Nantucket.

34
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,507
Well, my offer still stands.

35
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:38,510
Three months' lodgings
for a single night's talk.

36
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,555
All I have in the world.

37
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,974
But I prefer to think of it
as an investment.

38
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,854
I want you to tell me
what happened to the Essex.

39
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,071
What do you think happened?

40
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,659
There are rumblings.
Rumors that the Essex was...

41
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:03,868
What do you want?

42
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,995
What story do you expect to hear?

43
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,580
That of the whale.

44
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,336
The Essex ran aground.
There was a full inquiry.

45
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,297
I believe the inquiry
was less than truthful.

46
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,175
Get out.

47
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,847
You are the last survivor
of the Essex, sir.

48
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,598
If you won't talk, who will?

49
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,686
Did you not hear me? Leave. Now.

50
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,609
- No. You mustn't go. Please.
- He is in no mind to talk.

51
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,320
And I haven't come all this way
to be humiliated and waste my time.

52
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,489
Please, Mr. Melville.

53
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:43,867
He won't talk about the Essex to me.

54
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,744
To anyone. Never has. Never.

55
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,582
There's an agony about him.

56
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:55,795
His soul is in torment,

57
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,214
and in need of confession.

58
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,092
Please, just let me talk to him.

59
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,469
Please.

60
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:09,225
Love.

61
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,025
I believe it would do you good
to talk to the man.

62
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,277
No.

63
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,741
You listen well.

64
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,995
Who holds this place together
while you drink yourself to death?

65
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,331
You will talk with this man

66
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:34,876
as much as is necessary to keep the money.

67
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,796
You know our circumstances, Thomas.

68
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,101
Only as much as is necessary.

69
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,234
I'll get whiskey.

70
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,616
I neglected to mention it
in my letter,

71
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,661
but I was a whaler once.

72
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,789
One trip, I mean.

73
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:14,624
Green hand.

74
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,834
So, you've seen it all.

75
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,797
My wife read your books.

76
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,967
She enjoyed them.

77
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:26,261
I'm happy to hear it.

78
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,055
I've had good sales.

79
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:32,183
And I think this story
could surpass the success

80
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,811
of even my first novel,
which did quite well.

81
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,314
Another of your seafaring yarns?

82
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,195
Have you read Hawthorne, Mr. Melville?

83
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:47,407
Now there's a writer.

84
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:49,993
Great writer.

85
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,369
He is.

86
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,666
But he is not here. And I am.

87
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,127
For my own particular reasons.

88
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:10,805
I will tell you of the Essex.

89
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,557
I believe you will be disappointed.

90
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,643
But every word I say will be true.

91
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:21,232
Story of the Essex
is the story of two men.

92
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:26,863
Captain George Pollard and his first mate,

93
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:29,907
Owen Chase.

94
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,702
Owen. You don't wanna be late.

95
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,621
I'll be there.

96
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,707
Besides, can't have our daughter
sleeping under a leaky roof, can we?

97
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,084
What makes you so sure it's a girl?

98
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,128
Well, it has to be.

99
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,546
So she can remind me

100
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,548
why I still love you
when you're being stubborn.

101
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,676
Well, if it's to be a daughter,
she'll be a version of you, not me.

102
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,721
Blond locks and determined
to conquer the world.

103
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,306
I suppose after today,

104
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,099
you'll be trading in
that tunic for a uniform.

105
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,392
That's right.

106
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,227
Finally out of this patch of dirt,

107
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,937
into a captain's house like you deserve.

108
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,608
I don't need one of those houses
in town with stuffy neighbors.

109
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:05,151
There's plenty of room here
for the three of us.

110
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,071
You know, sometimes your kind heart
and good nature

111
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,490
is just unbearable.

112
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,327
Go get your captaincy.

113
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,080
- What's your bid?
- I'll have $1.90.

114
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:02,041
I've got 1,000 gallons at $2!

115
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,418
I'll take 40 shares!

116
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,046
Seller! Seller! Over here!

117
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,053
Criterion's back with a fine haul.

118
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,763
1,600 barrels.

119
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:16,973
A new record.

120
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,810
£50 sterling for head matter
on the London market.

121
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,646
Congratulations.

122
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,657
- Good morning, Mr. Chase.
- Mr. Mason.

123
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,242
Come in, please.

124
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,121
My partner, Benjamin Fuller.

125
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,414
Good morning, sir.

126
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,166
Do sit down.

127
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,088
Mr. Chase.

128
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,674
I do hope you realize how satisfied we are

129
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,676
with the work you've done for us
over the years.

130
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,553
Thank you, sir.

131
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,930
Now, one of our ships, the Essex,

132
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,016
has just been refitted at great expense

133
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,185
and is to go to sea.

134
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,937
Now, having made
such an investment in her,

135
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,691
we want to be sure
she's in the best possible hands.

136
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:13,696
So, it gives us great pleasure
to offer you a position aboard her.

137
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,532
As first mate.

138
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,286
As first mate?

139
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,579
Mmm-hmm.

140
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,750
Mr. Mason, you promised me
command of a ship after my last voyage

141
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:28,211
when I brought you back 1,500 barrels.

142
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,046
Do you remember?
You gave me your word.

143
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,716
That promise must now be deferred.

144
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,803
Like everyone else,
we've had a lean time recently.

145
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,095
No, never on my watch.

146
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,057
Nantucket now dominates the world market.

147
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,810
That must not change.

148
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,604
This is no time for experimentation.

149
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,483
The Essex will be captained
by George Pollard,

150
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,736
scion of a great whaling family.

151
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,573
His father also happens to be our patron.

152
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:58,991
Blood, Mr. Chase.

153
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,661
You can have all the voyages
under your belt you want,

154
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,496
but blood will always win out.

155
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,624
Yes, well, blood is not gonna fill
a ship with oil, Mr. Mason.

156
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,376
To successfully command,
a captain needs respect.

157
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,253
Now, what if the men don't respect him?

158
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,713
You will make sure that they do.

159
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,049
Ah, good day, gentlemen.

160
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,635
I understand your disappointment,

161
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,014
so, a one-fifteenth lay.

162
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,352
That's more than
I've ever paid any first officer.

163
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,647
And if you bring back
2,000 barrels of oil,

164
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,774
I give you my word,

165
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,319
next time, you will have your captaincy.

166
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,197
You've given me
your word before, Mr. Mason.

167
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,285
No, this time, I'll take it in writing.

168
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,508
Captain Pollard.

169
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,470
We've just had a most
agreeable conversation with Mr. Chase.

170
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,140
He'll be honored to serve under you.

171
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,851
I'm glad to hear it.

172
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,520
Now I'm to babysit a greenhorn.

173
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,439
Some chinless Nantucketer

174
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,900
born with a damn silver spoon
in his mouth.

175
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,193
You know, I should've thrown
the offer back in their faces.

176
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,780
Why? You now have
the offer of command in writing.

177
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,908
Yes, well, a liar's word is worthless,

178
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,743
even on paper.

179
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:35,963
You know, I'd love you just as much
if you were a merchant captain.

180
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,591
And you wouldn't be gone for two years.

181
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,009
I won't be gone two years.

182
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,846
A Bedford whaler came back
last week who was gone three.

183
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,474
She lost two men
and still with her hull half empty.

184
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:47,767
Yeah, well, they were from Bedford,

185
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,185
and they didn't have me on board.

186
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,900
Son of a bitch!

187
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,363
I will captain my own ship!

188
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,699
A whaling ship.

189
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,869
Up to them, all we'd ever have
is this patch of dirt,

190
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,412
and that's not gonna happen, Peggy.

191
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,373
Those are your father's words, not yours.

192
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,500
What's wrong with his words?

193
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,336
He wanted things
for his family, for himself.

194
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:17,838
He was a dreamer, Owen.

195
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,882
Yes, he was.

196
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,801
Dreamed of the sea
and never got to sail it

197
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,302
because of men like them.

198
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,471
At least he got to see his children born.

199
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,982
It's all I know.

200
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,278
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,366
I married a whaleman.

202
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,916
Hey.

203
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,421
I'll come back as quick
as a summer's night, I swear.

204
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,891
Just come back.

205
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,269
Promise me.

206
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,441
I already swore to you.
Now you want me to promise, too?

207
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,613
I promise.

208
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,838
Son, a word with you.

209
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,177
To be a captain, you cannot be a friend.

210
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,470
You are their superior.

211
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,599
Never forget that.
Never let them forget that.

212
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:52,975
Thank you, sir.

213
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:56,979
Your great-grandfather and a few others
created this industry.

214
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:01,567
Without us, without you,
the world plunges into darkness.

215
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,987
I hope to bring honor to
the Pollard family name, sir.

216
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:15,289
"Thou didst, O Lord,
create the mighty whale

217
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:18,375
"That wondrous monster of a mighty length

218
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:22,213
"Beyond conception his unmeasured strength

219
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,591
"But, everlasting God, thou dost ordain

220
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,887
"That we, poor feeble mortals
should engage

221
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:33,933
"Ourselves, our wives
and children to maintain

222
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:37,478
"This dreadful monster
with a martial rage"

223
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:45,569
O Father, grant that your glorious light
shine on these men.

224
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,448
Ensure them a prosperous voyage,

225
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,868
that they may return safely
and with a full ship,

226
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,206
so that the white flames
of Nantucket whale oil

227
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,209
may continue to keep light in our homes,

228
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:04,088
city streets safe from sin in the night,

229
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,966
and to fuel the machines of industry

230
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:10,010
that drive our great nation forward

231
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,597
as our noble species evolves.

232
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,559
In your name, we pray.

233
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:29,280
- So, what month was this?
- Late in the year.

234
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:32,324
We were one of the last ships to go out,

235
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,577
which is why my friend
Barzillai and I got a berth.

236
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,414
You know, I was 14.

237
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,457
Fourteen.

238
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:44,128
Nickerson, you're standing
around, boy. Move!

239
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:47,882
First time to sea.
Scared, but more scared to show it.

240
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,758
Barzillai was 17.

241
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,011
Orphans. Grew up on the wharf.

242
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,930
Both in a hurry to be called men.

243
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,729
Grubs, what are those pins
they're wearing?

244
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,772
They're whale pins, Thomas.

245
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,275
How do I get one of them?

246
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,485
Well, you gotta thrust the killing lance

247
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,738
into the largest beast that
ever breathed on this Earth.

248
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,701
Nickerson, get the green stuff
to Mr. Bond, there.

249
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,454
Make it quick, damn it.

250
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,248
I shall have 12 of those one day.

251
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,959
Windlass is ready
and sails are loose, sir.

252
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,920
Mr. Joy,
this is only half my order!

253
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,588
Put them over the ground tier casks.

254
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,466
Well, well, you being on board
means only one thing.

255
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,635
Yeah, at least there's
one person on this ship

256
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,136
who knows the truth about Owen Chase.

257
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,680
No, that all the other ships
have already crewed up.

258
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,182
Now, now.

259
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,642
I'm a reformed man, Owen.

260
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,685
Question is, are you?

261
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,812
Don't tell me Matthew Joy's
put down the bottle.

262
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,814
Dry as sand.

263
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,650
Has Owen Chase put down his temper?

264
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,860
Ah, serene as the church.

265
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,488
I'll believe that when I see it.

266
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,657
And given our captain,

267
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:58,160
I'll give your serenity about 48 hours?

268
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,162
Good luck.

269
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,295
Pollard. George Pollard.

270
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,130
Owen Chase.

271
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,967
"Chase."
That's an off-island name, isn't it?

272
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,177
Yes, it is.

273
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,846
And very shortly, we will be
off-island for some time,

274
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,348
and I'll be very much at home.

275
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,726
Must say I was surprised.

276
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,271
Normally, a captain gets
to choose his first mate.

277
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,648
An experienced captain, yes.

278
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,693
'Course, you can understand
from the owners' point of view,

279
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,195
they want to feel their investment's
in the hands of men.

280
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,363
Indeed.

281
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,116
They probably want a little
extra reassurance, that's all.

282
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,201
Well, do keep an eye on me

283
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,703
and let me know
if I'm doing anything wrong.

284
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,538
Oh, I know no other way, Captain.

285
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:43,998
Hmm.

286
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,135
Mr. Chase, haul short the anchor.

287
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,678
Yank to the wind! There's topmen aloft.

288
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,555
- Aye!
- Mr. Lawrence, take the helm.

289
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,223
- Aye, sir.
- Mr. Joy, make sail.

290
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,684
Mr. Cole! Mr. Chappel!
Stand by the spanker.

291
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,312
Set your fore staysail
and your fore and main topsails.

292
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,813
Come on, look lively, you lads.

293
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,315
Come on, Nickerson!
While we're young!

294
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,941
Let fall clews
and bunts and sheet ho!

295
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,277
Set topsails and topgallants.

296
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,487
- Heave away on the windlass.
- Heave away on the windlass.

297
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,159
Set topgallants.

298
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,077
Let go clew lines and sheet ho!

299
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,246
There's a snarl in the gasket, sir.

300
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,373
Mr. Chappel, take the helm.

301
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,334
It won't clear, Mr. Chase!

302
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,879
Come on! Why aren't those braces laid out?

303
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,423
Mr. Ray, where are my headsails?

304
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:35,924
Aye, sir!

305
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,260
Crank away on the windlass!

306
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:39,928
Crank away on the windlass, sir!

307
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,389
Nickerson, pull!

308
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,269
Make sail, God damn it!

309
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,481
God and all of Nantucket
is watching, men.

310
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,612
Anchor's trim!

311
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,780
Captain! Head down!

312
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,323
Mind your head, Captain.

313
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:03,952
What's the matter, Mr. Sheppard?

314
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,579
Gasket's fouled the sheet, sir.

315
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,748
It won't clear, Mr. Chase!

316
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,625
Topgallant sheet is jammed!

317
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,168
The gasket still won't clear!

318
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,463
We don't have enough sail on yet.

319
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:15,631
Still won't clear!

320
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,222
Watch your step!

321
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,391
It's the gasket, Owen!

322
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,112
Stand clear.

323
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,537
Whoa! Bloody hell!

324
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,914
- Let fall your course!
- Heave!

325
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,918
Make fast!

326
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,599
Nice piece of work, Mr. Chase.

327
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,364
If we make Cape Verdes
in the next two weeks,

328
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:25,617
we'll have a decent chance
of reaching the Pacific on schedule.

329
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,121
Corn, Mr. Chase?

330
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,331
Oh, no, thank you, sir.

331
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,749
Never did have much of a taste for it.

332
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:35,836
That's odd.

333
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,672
Told your father grew corn on Cape Cod.

334
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,215
That's right. He did.

335
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,383
As you can imagine,

336
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,343
I certainly grew tired
of eating it every day.

337
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,181
Corn.

338
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,476
- Okra. Beans, I believe?
- Mmm-hmm.

339
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:52,394
Before he went to jail.

340
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,899
Are you familiar with this story, Mr. Joy?

341
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,859
Sir?

342
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,569
Were you aware that

343
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:04,281
Mr. Chase was effectively orphaned
due to his father's incarceration?

344
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:07,576
Well, we all have our own paths to sea.

345
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,121
As a rule, we tend
not to ask too many questions.

346
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:12,831
Hmm.

347
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,416
Can't have been easy, though.

348
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,751
Yet

349
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,922
you had Nantucket's great seafaring family
to adopt you.

350
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,590
This is far from the first time

351
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,051
I've been called a landsman
or an off-islander

352
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,302
by some Nantucketer,

353
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:28,514
reminding me how I am not
a part of that family.

354
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,934
Now, if the Captain will excuse me,

355
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,269
there are whaleboats
and watches to assign.

356
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,362
No, sir. Not for me.

357
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,739
- Not a drop?
- No, sir.

358
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,283
Like I said,

359
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:51,370
sometimes the fewer questions one asks,
the better.

360
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,296
Serve that food up.

361
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,800
Getting this
slop on the first day?

362
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:06,843
Cheap bastards. Where's the meat?

363
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,682
That's a gorgeous girl,
Mr. Chappel.

364
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,810
A vision of beauty, that.
Carved on a varnished whale bone.

365
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:16,979
- Let me have a touch.
- Don't touch.

366
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,815
I thought you were married, anyway.

367
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,483
I am, and there she is.

368
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,112
Well, that's her nose, anyway.

369
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,489
Congratulations, ladies.

370
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,494
That was a fine job trimming sails today.

371
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,622
A sorrier pack of deck wallopers
I don't think I've ever seen.

372
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,667
Mr. Chappel.

373
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,169
- Sir!
- You're Captain's harpooner.

374
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,672
Mr. Lawrence, you'll be mine.

375
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,173
Aye, sir.

376
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:46,758
And Mr. Peterson.

377
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,845
Second mate's harpooner.

378
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,179
Aye, sir.

379
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,265
There'll be six men to a boat.

380
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,809
First drills are tomorrow.
Six bells sharp.

381
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:58,520
We're not even east of Halifax, sir.

382
00:23:58,688 --> 00:23:59,688
What's your name?

383
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,858
Coffin. Henry Coffin.

384
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,693
He's the Captain's cousin, sir.

385
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,697
Well, well, Mr. Coffin.

386
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,741
You think a whale knows
if it's east of Halifax?

387
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,414
I don't know who all of you are
or how you got here.

388
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,001
Some of you probably have felonies to hide
and you're on the run.

389
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:24,004
That's fine. I don't give a damn.

390
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,715
But in return, you exist for one thing

391
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:29,301
and one thing only.

392
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,886
And that is whale oil.

393
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,347
I intend to fill our 2,000 barrels

394
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,349
and be home as quickly as possible.

395
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:36,725
And even when the weather is fine

396
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:38,518
and there are no whales, Mr. Coffin,

397
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,063
we will lower the boats
and practice all maneuvers

398
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,732
necessary in the capture of a whale.

399
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,068
And any man who is idle
will find himself swimming home.

400
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,235
Is that understood?

401
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:48,445
Aye, sir.

402
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:49,613
Sir.

403
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,743
Greenhorn.

404
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,745
On deck.

405
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,458
On you go.

406
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,629
Aye, aye, landsman.

407
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,297
Thomas Nickerson, right?

408
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:08,507
Aye, sir.

409
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,385
You know, some feel sick at first.

410
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,598
Please, pull me back up!

411
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,725
Best way to square it
with King Neptune, boy!

412
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,102
Please bring me up!

413
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,024
Better now?

414
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,528
Ah, shit.

415
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,614
Sir, I am so sorry.

416
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:36,952
Well, now you got something
to write home to your mother about.

417
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,793
My mother's buried up in Smith's Hill.

418
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,087
There's a stone for my father, too.

419
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,881
He was lost at sea before I was born.

420
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:52,300
Here, give me that.

421
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,723
Well, this is your family now, boy.

422
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,891
For better or for worse.

423
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,311
Worse, mostly.

424
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,649
Swab the deck, kid.

425
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:27,127
Dogwatch! You're gonna learn
what it takes to be whalers today, mates.

426
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,754
Aye, sir!

427
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,213
You led that line wrong, Nickerson.

428
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:31,381
Aye, sir.

429
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,175
We'll stay at this
till sundown if we have to.

430
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,426
Aye, Mr. Joy, sir!

431
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:35,927
Main topsail leech lines!

432
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,554
Harpooner, make ready to boat!

433
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,347
- Aye, sir!
- Aye, Mr. Joy!

434
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,057
Go main topsail leech lines.

435
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:42,809
Too slow, you damn coofs!

436
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,019
The bailing piggins.

437
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,021
You will learn
every inch of this ship

438
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:47,564
- before you return to your bunks.
- Aye, sir!

439
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,403
Sweat that line, Barz.

440
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:54,571
You need to move quicker, Mr. Ray.

441
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:55,781
Aye, Mr. Chase.

442
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,449
Ain't no greenhorns
no more, Mr. Chase.

443
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,036
You're a sailor now!

444
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,708
Not bad, Mr. Ray. Well done.

445
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,585
- Forecourse bunts!
- Aye, sir.

446
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:11,046
Get used to it, lads.
You're gonna work like horses.

447
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,214
Mr. Chase?

448
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:13,965
Sir.

449
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:15,967
Set stunsails.

450
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,887
Is that wise, sir?
We're nearing the Gulf Stream.

451
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,722
Best keep it five knots
till we can see the weather.

452
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,058
We are two days behind.

453
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:26,061
We need to make up the time
if we're to catch the easterlies.

454
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,147
Set stunsails.

455
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:35,737
- Set stunsails.
- Aye, Mr. Chase!

456
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:39,324
- Come on, move.
- Belay that! Set stunsails!

457
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,159
Get aloft, Mr. Coffin.

458
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,494
- The captain wants speed.
- Aye, sir.

459
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,704
Look for braces, lads.

460
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:45,956
- Trim for speed.
- Aye, sir.

461
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:49,918
Set fore the main topsail
and topgallant stunsails, men. Move it.

462
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,381
Make fast your stunsail halyard.

463
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:56,258
Make fast stunsail halyard, sir.

464
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,510
Stunsail boom ready, sir!

465
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,012
Bracing fore topsail, sir.

466
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:03,807
Hey!

467
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,784
The captain's got us moving now!

468
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,369
We're finally getting somewhere!

469
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,873
She may be old,
but she can still roll, boys!

470
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,718
Sir, a squall on the starboard bow.

471
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,970
We must shorten sail immediately.

472
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,972
Not just yet, Mr. Chase.

473
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,474
Sir, we are headed into a squall
at more than 8 knots,

474
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:47,976
and it's moving faster than that.

475
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:50,395
Let it come.
The men are soft from months on land.

476
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:51,563
They need a good baptism.

477
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,023
Let them know our work has begun.

478
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,487
If we don't shorten sail and bear off,
it'll catch us on the beam.

479
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,741
Mr. Chase, we will stand on.

480
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,409
Mr. Lawrence?

481
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:05,577
Hold our course.

482
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:07,120
Holding course, sir.

483
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:10,457
We'll lose half a day running
like that. We'll skirt the edge of it.

484
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,627
If the men can't handle a gust like this,
then God help us all.

485
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,181
Best secure for heavy weather.

486
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:27,849
Rough weather coming up, boys.

487
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:29,059
Get this deck secure.

488
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,109
Double gripes on the boats!

489
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:47,118
Best prepare for weather, Mr. Bond.

490
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,995
We're headed into a squall.

491
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:50,622
Secure the main hatch!

492
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,790
She's moving fast!

493
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,516
We must fall off and run with it.

494
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,559
We will stand on, Mr. Chase.

495
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,061
Mr. Lawrence!

496
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:16,147
- Hold your course.
- Holding course, sir.

497
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:29,995
Sea's coming aboard!

498
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,830
Hold on!

499
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,957
Shorten sail, Mr. Chase!

500
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,918
- Climb to weather and grab the shrouds!
- Climb to weather!

501
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,087
Get to windward and hold on!

502
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:43,425
- We need to get those sails down!
- Go lee!

503
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,928
Nickerson, hold fast!

504
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,723
Hold steady lines!

505
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,357
Hold fast!

506
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:00,817
Turn the ship!

507
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,360
Turn to leeward!

508
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,446
No! The damage is done!

509
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,198
- Strike topgallants. Let fly sheets!
- No, turn the ship!

510
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,867
Veer off, Mr. Lawrence.

511
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,202
It's too late! It's too goddamn late!

512
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,538
- We'll be broadsided!
- Turn this ship!

513
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:22,714
- Hold on!
- Turn!

514
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,550
Strike those damn topgallants!

515
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:33,433
Hold on!

516
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,882
Look out!

517
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,529
Mr. Joy!

518
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,824
- We have to cut away the topgallants!
- Topgallants away!

519
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,492
We have to get her upright!

520
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:28,423
You wish to see me, sir?

521
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,718
At six bells tomorrow,

522
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:34,888
you will assemble the crew.

523
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:38,850
Inform them that we will be returning
to Nantucket for repairs.

524
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,685
You will then apologize to them

525
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,187
for interfering with a captain's order,

526
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,772
which nearly cost the lives
of every man on this ship today.

527
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,107
What?

528
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,943
I'll accept your resignation
upon our return to port.

529
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,403
That will be all.

530
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:53,865
- It was your order to set stunsails, sir.
- That decision was sound.

531
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,742
The men needed testing.

532
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,410
So you send them into a storm?

533
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,162
That was unlucky.

534
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,372
No, it was bad seamanship.

535
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,750
And blaming misfortune
is just plain weakness.

536
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:05,293
Damn your impertinence!

537
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,879
Do you know who you're speaking to?

538
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,632
My name is Captain George Pollard.

539
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:11,799
Pollard!

540
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,639
And you, Mr. Chase,
no matter how many whale pins

541
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,307
you may have on your lapel,

542
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,226
are nothing more than the son of a farmer

543
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:24,687
who's managed to bully his way
into an officer's tunic.

544
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,774
Now get out.

545
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:33,655
To return to port
without a single barrel of oil

546
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,365
would be a mistake, sir.

547
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,576
And not behoove a man
whose name is Pollard.

548
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:40,828
Or Chase, for that matter.

549
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:42,747
And the best thing for both of us

550
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:45,541
would be to work all hours God sends us,

551
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,461
fill this ship with oil
and be home inside a year

552
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:50,672
and rid of one another
as quickly as possible.

553
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,844
Trust me, I am every bit
as desirous of that as you.

554
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:02,600
Of course, that is a captain's decision.

555
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,364
They were like an ill-married couple.

556
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:21,202
An ill-married couple
will tolerate each other, Mr. Melville.

557
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,205
But an ill-married couple
can also bring down a ship.

558
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:25,999
Are you married, Mr. Melville?

559
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,210
- I am.
- God have mercy on you.

560
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:31,963
First child on the way, too.

561
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,090
So, does your good wife
know that you've brought

562
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:36,426
all you have in the world here tonight

563
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:37,677
and given it to a stranger?

564
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,430
No, sir.

565
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,724
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

566
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,726
So,

567
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:49,314
the Essex did not return to port.

568
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:50,648
She did not.

569
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,402
- She continued out to sea.
- Yes, she did.

570
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,945
And before long,

571
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,322
we heard that call

572
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,449
that all whalemen pray for.

573
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,701
"Blows."

574
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,330
Blows!

575
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,956
To windward!

576
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:08,875
There she blows!

577
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,836
Right or sperm, Mr. Ramsdell?

578
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:13,338
Sperm whales they are!

579
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,006
There go the flukes!

580
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:16,507
Mr. Chase!

581
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:17,925
Hoist and swing boats.

582
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,094
All hands! All hands on deck!

583
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:23,264
All hands on deck!

584
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:27,602
Away the boats.

585
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,772
Lower away!

586
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,342
Straight! Crack them backbones.

587
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,968
Aye, sir!

588
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,303
Give way all.

589
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:05,264
Spring those oars till your arms fall off.

590
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,685
There they breach!

591
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:12,980
Thataway, boys! Full pressure!

592
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,232
Aye, sir!

593
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,318
Come on! Put your back into it.

594
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,322
Pull!

595
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,698
Pull like a vengeance!

596
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,367
There she blows!

597
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:28,996
- That's a calf.
Whoo-hoo!

598
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,209
That's the calf?

599
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,627
That's the cow.

600
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:48,516
And that's our boy!
That's the money.

601
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,768
- Nickerson, push!
- Sorry, sir.

602
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,311
Forty-barreler?

603
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:53,855
Fifty.

604
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,357
Oh, he's a buster!

605
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:58,901
Bite the oars, lads.

606
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:01,154
Blister your goddamn lungs!

607
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,780
Full pressure!

608
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,491
Smartly, lads! Smartly!

609
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:06,951
Mind your oars!

610
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,872
- Mr. Ramsdell, prepare the line.
- Aye, sir.

611
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:16,169
Mr. Lawrence, the first one's mine.

612
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,839
Take me to the pretty spot.

613
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:23,885
- Pull!
- Come on. Stay on him.

614
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:44,989
You're on your first
Nantucket sleigh ride, boy.

615
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:46,657
Oh, my God!

616
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,284
Whoo!

617
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,587
Look at him!

618
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,881
The most fearsome creature
ever to live on this Earth.

619
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:13,226
He sounds.

620
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:17,688
My hands!

621
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,615
We need
to wet the line, Nickerson.

622
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,540
Give way, lads. Give way.

623
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,631
Got 140 fathoms
of line left, Mr. Chase.

624
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,308
Eighty fathoms of line left, sir!

625
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,856
He's gonna pull us under!

626
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:04,735
Matthew, I need your line!

627
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,362
Keep going!

628
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,823
- Peterson, give me the line.
- Aye, sir.

629
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,783
Give me that line, Mr. Peterson.

630
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,327
We're down
to 60 fathoms of line left, sir!

631
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:17,623
- Twenty fathoms, Mr. Chase.
- Tie it off!

632
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,546
- Safe!
- Go!

633
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,853
- Peterson, lay out.
- Aye, sir.

634
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,772
How many fathoms can he go?

635
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:44,525
70 fathoms left, sir.

636
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:48,070
No, no, no, wait.

637
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,202
- Owen!
- No, no! Not yet!

638
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,871
Don't touch that line!

639
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,248
Down to 50 fathoms, sir.

640
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,376
Owen, God damn it!

641
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:04,211
I said don't touch it!

642
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,714
30 fathoms left, Mr. Joy.

643
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,844
Ten fathoms left, sir!

644
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,590
Backwater!

645
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,303
Push!

646
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,725
Chimney's afire!

647
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,310
Chimney's afire!

648
00:42:02,396 --> 00:42:03,396
Afire!

649
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:36,804
Hurry it along, lads.

650
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:40,808
God! Get out, you bastards.

651
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,575
Blubber in the oil.

652
00:42:57,868 --> 00:42:59,994
Smell that, boys!
That's us making money!

653
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:02,788
Get out of there,
you sons of bitches.

654
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,418
- There, you got it?
- There's not a chance.

655
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,758
- How's it looking?
- It's not good.

656
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,344
That's it.

657
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,184
- Mr. Chase, sir.
- Yeah?

658
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:26,061
That's all of it, sir.
We can't get any more out.

659
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,689
That's the gold in there, boys.
Come on, keep digging.

660
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:30,649
We're too big to wriggle down there.

661
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,359
Then find someone who can.

662
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,242
Nickerson! Come here, boy.

663
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:45,372
Hey! I said come here.

664
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,251
Climb on into him.

665
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:52,171
Come on, Thomas.

666
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,298
What's in there is worth
a hell of a lot more

667
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,258
than what they're boiling down.

668
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,555
Sir!

669
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:03,808
I can't, I'm...

670
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:05,726
I'm sorry. I can't.

671
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:08,854
You get down there,
or I'll have you sleep down there.

672
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,984
You best put that between your teeth, boy.

673
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,779
Stinks worse than
the devil's asshole down there.

674
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,159
Thanks.

675
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:28,290
Sorry.

676
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,793
Here, Nickerson,
take my pillow with you.

677
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:34,797
Down you go.

678
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,315
A man gets to know himself down there.

679
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:58,737
- They ever send you into a whale's head?
- No.

680
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:01,031
I was spared.

681
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,326
Well, that's where the treasure is.

682
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,789
I'll never forget that first bull.

683
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,458
Forty-seven barrels.

684
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,212
'Course, the happiness was short-lived.

685
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,631
The waters there had all been fished out?

686
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:19,133
That they had.

687
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,636
So, we headed further out.

688
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:26,515
Yeah.

689
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:29,143
Took us a month to round the Horn.

690
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,981
Left the South Atlantic behind
with a sliver of hope

691
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:36,609
that things could change for the better.

692
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:41,405
But making the Pacific
didn't improve our lot.

693
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:46,118
Whale sightings were too damn scarce.

694
00:45:48,914 --> 00:45:50,998
After nearly a year at sea,

695
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:55,127
the temperaments of our captain
and first mate grew more strained.

696
00:45:57,005 --> 00:45:59,590
Captain Pollard spent most
days and nights in his cabin,

697
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:02,843
afraid to look his crew in the eye.

698
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,768
Our hold was almost empty.

699
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:14,521
And to gaze upon our paltry efforts

700
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,857
only served as a reminder

701
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:20,027
that we were a long way from going home.

702
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:45,719
No, no. I don't talk that talk.

703
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:47,554
- Speak English.
- Offer me more.

704
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:52,059
- Here, sir.
- This, Nantucket whale oil.

705
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:56,563
- Ain't no skinny hog worth more than that.
- More!

706
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:51,118
Capitán. Excuse me.

707
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:53,579
The locals told me your voyage
was waylaid, sir.

708
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:56,123
Captain George Pollard. The Essex.

709
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,460
Capitán Clemente Pelaez, the Santa Maria.

710
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,880
Would you buy a colleague a drink?

711
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,679
No, no.

712
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,975
Bad luck? How far out?

713
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:18,645
Far enough for only a fool to go.

714
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:20,522
How far would that be?

715
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:23,984
A thousand leagues along the equator.

716
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,153
The Offshore Grounds.

717
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,073
Were there whales there?

718
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,242
More than you've ever dreamed.

719
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,660
Hundreds.

720
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:37,206
Fields of flukes far as the eye can see.

721
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:40,375
Could have filled up 3,000 barrels
in the space of a day.

722
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:41,752
What do you mean, "could have"?

723
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:48,550
If it weren't for that demon.

724
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:51,929
A whale.

725
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,681
White as alabaster.

726
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,351
Hundred feet long.

727
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,854
Sent six of my crew to their graves.

728
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:12,658
And the rest of us,
something to remember him by.

729
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,244
Now, this white whale,

730
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,621
did he dance a jig
and pick your pocket as well?

731
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:19,248
Hmm?

732
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:24,253
Gracias.

733
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,883
You believe that?

734
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:35,931
If we set sail now,
catch the south easterlies

735
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:37,474
at their best time and fill our belly,

736
00:49:37,851 --> 00:49:39,184
we could be home in six months.

737
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,063
What say you, Mr. Chase?

738
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,606
No need to endure our predicament

739
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:46,441
for a moment longer than necessary.

740
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:47,901
Amen to that.

741
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:49,236
Amen.

742
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:54,575
Greed took hold
of our captain and first mate.

743
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,952
So we headed out.

744
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,663
A thousand leagues along the equator.

745
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:04,418
Where knowledge ended, speculation began.

746
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:06,837
That's where the whales had gone to hide.

747
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,799
As far from man as they could possibly go.

748
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:12,926
But we hunted them down.

749
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:15,888
Centuries before,

750
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:19,183
sailors feared
sailing off the edge of the Earth.

751
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:24,021
But we were headed for the edge of sanity.

752
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,484
Trust gave way to doubt.

753
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:33,447
Hope to blind superstition.

754
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,782
Captain, the men are talking.

755
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:38,035
That's what men do.

756
00:50:38,328 --> 00:50:40,662
They aren't happy with your decision
to sail out this far.

757
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,082
Well, did you correct them?

758
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,127
Did you remind them of our purpose
to fill this ship with whale oil,

759
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:50,088
and if the whales are 1,000 leagues out,
that that is where we will go?

760
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,341
Cousin, please.

761
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:56,762
This is madness.

762
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,641
You have let yourself
be influenced by that man.

763
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,851
You must turn this ship back.

764
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,104
I suggest you go back down,

765
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:09,650
reassure the men, be a leader

766
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:14,404
and don't ever, ever abuse
the privilege of family with me again.

767
00:51:16,658 --> 00:51:18,116
Mr. Coffin.

768
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,022
What is it?

769
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:50,774
Listen.

770
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:53,193
Mr. Chase?
I see some white water.

771
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:54,528
- Where?
- Portside!

772
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:56,280
- We're away!
- Portside, Captain!

773
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,282
- Where are they?
- You see anything?

774
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:06,915
Lower away!

775
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:11,336
Lower away! Lower away!

776
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:14,047
The devil take the Mexican grounds!

777
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:54,963
Peak oars!

778
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:57,591
Give it to him, Mr. Chappel!

779
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:00,385
Stick him, man! Stick him!

780
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,933
Dead ahead, Peterson!

781
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:22,115
Don't let him chew your oars, boys.
Back to it.

782
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:48,183
- The whale?
- Yes.

783
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:51,353
- So it's true?
- Yes.

784
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:53,647
Too much is true.

785
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:55,941
Get it up!

786
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:13,208
Full pressure!

787
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,141
Mr. Bond!

788
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,393
Back the foreyard, lower the tackle!

789
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:32,853
Aye, sir!

790
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:35,981
Here she comes, Peterson. Now, now!

791
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,205
Mr. Lawrence, take us leeward,
head us straight for the school.

792
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:53,498
Aye, sir.

793
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:55,834
- Hot tar, sir.
- We'll find him.

794
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,382
We're boat to black skin.

795
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:04,468
Beach us on her!

796
00:55:14,437 --> 00:55:16,062
She's ours, men!

797
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,763
What was that, Mr. Lawrence?

798
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:55,435
Mr. Chase!

799
00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:04,653
God damn it.

800
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:06,780
Find Mr...

801
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:33,139
Mr. Easton!

802
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:52,409
Get Mr. Lawrence
to man the pumps!

803
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:54,244
Where is he?

804
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,162
Port bow!

805
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:10,176
Get me the biggest irons we have.

806
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:14,848
He wants a fight?

807
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:26,401
Never seen a whale do that.

808
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:27,861
Mr. Lawrence,
take the wheel.

809
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:30,196
Mr. Ramsdell,
secure the other end of the line

810
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:31,906
- to the foremast.
- Aye, sir.

811
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:35,410
As I live and breathe, he's mine.

812
00:57:58,684 --> 00:57:59,684
Ah!

813
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,415
- Cut the line!
- Look out!

814
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:17,929
- Captain!
- What?

815
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,640
The Essex! She's listing.

816
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,778
Turn this boat around!

817
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,940
- Help me!
- Nickerson!

818
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,484
- Mr. Joy!
- Here!

819
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:13,735
- Give me your hand!
- Help!

820
01:00:13,903 --> 01:00:15,028
Nickerson!

821
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:52,565
Mr. Chase!

822
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:56,277
A whale, sir.

823
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:57,987
It stove the ship.

824
01:00:58,697 --> 01:00:59,739
What?

825
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:02,492
We lost Easton and Sanborn.

826
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:06,746
The pumps are useless, sir.

827
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:15,713
Prepare to abandon ship.

828
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:17,340
We can't row our way home.

829
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:19,634
We'll have to strip her of her sails

830
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:21,302
- and jimmy-rig something.
- Aye, sir.

831
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,888
Gather as much food
and water as you can carry.

832
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:26,307
We're gonna need
all the fresh water you can find.

833
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:28,268
Nickerson,
you grab as much as you can.

834
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:29,435
Barz, come with me.

835
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:35,775
Sweet Lord!

836
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:37,902
First, the sails,
then the provisions.

837
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:43,074
Get as much food
as you can carry, lad.

838
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:45,952
Make haste, boys!

839
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,955
Nickerson, there are
more casks in steerage.

840
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:51,291
- Got it?
- Hardtack is dry.

841
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:52,959
Move sprightly, gentlemen.

842
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:54,294
Lower away!

843
01:01:54,587 --> 01:01:56,754
- Take those tack lines.
- Up aloft!

844
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:57,922
Lower away! Bring it down!

845
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,132
Mr. Cole, get that yard down.

846
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,300
Bring it down. Keep it coming!

847
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:03,303
Hold off!

848
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:12,770
- Come on, Nickerson!
- Get those sails!

849
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:15,857
There you go.

850
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:20,403
Get that yard down!

851
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:25,074
We need the sails. Not enough water.

852
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:31,998
Get the barrels, now!

853
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,167
Strip that rigging!

854
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:36,544
More fresh water!
More hardtack! Come on!

855
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:38,588
I can see
more casks in the steerage!

856
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:41,507
Benjamin! Quick! Come on!

857
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:42,884
- Give me your hand!
- Get him up.

858
01:02:43,052 --> 01:02:44,177
I got you.

859
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:45,720
Hardtack!

860
01:02:46,013 --> 01:02:47,680
Come on! Move it!

861
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:49,933
Step lively, Mr. Nickerson!

862
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:57,690
Gotta get away from the oil!

863
01:02:57,858 --> 01:02:59,359
She's going down! She's listing!

864
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:00,526
Where's Owen?

865
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:01,819
Nickerson, where is Mr. Chase?

866
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:03,655
He was just here, sir.

867
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:06,032
- Come on, hurry up!
- Owen!

868
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,325
- Mr. Chase!
- We gotta shove off!

869
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:09,619
Come on, now, boys!

870
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,162
Oil on deck!

871
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:14,374
- Captain!
- Mr. Chase!

872
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:35,979
Mr. Chase, sir!

873
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:37,814
Owen!

874
01:03:38,107 --> 01:03:39,399
Where is the first mate?

875
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:42,276
- Owen!
- Mr. Chase, sir!

876
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:51,619
- Owen!
- She's gonna blow!

877
01:03:51,954 --> 01:03:52,954
- Owen!
- We gotta move!

878
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:55,081
No, wait! Wait!

879
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:56,666
Mr. Chase, sir!

880
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,044
Mr. Chase!

881
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:46,758
There he is!
There he is! There he is!

882
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:50,887
- Over here!
- Mr. Chase!

883
01:04:53,474 --> 01:04:54,807
Move that!

884
01:04:55,476 --> 01:04:57,143
Mr. Chase, sir.

885
01:04:57,478 --> 01:04:59,103
- Here!
- Get ahold, now.

886
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:00,605
We got you.

887
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,107
- Sir.
- You're all right now, Mr. Chase.

888
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:09,072
Going fishing, are we?

889
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,491
Clean and load it, Mr. Joy.

890
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:26,047
Back away,
or she'll take us down with her.

891
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,110
Captain.

892
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:13,279
What about our provisions?

893
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:22,205
Two ounces of hardtack a day per man.

894
01:07:23,457 --> 01:07:25,124
And half a cup of water.

895
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:30,630
Hey, man, we can't live on that.

896
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:31,964
Not for more than a few days.

897
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:50,358
It's he.

898
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:57,114
Yeah, it's him, all right.

899
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:02,495
You don't fool me, Mr. Chase.

900
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:04,372
Mr. Coffin?

901
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:06,832
- That right?
- You put us here.

902
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,126
You know you put us here.

903
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:12,588
- Hey! Put it down!
- Mr. Coffin, put the pistol down.

904
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:14,173
- Say you're scared!
- What are you doing?

905
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:15,758
Mr. Coffin, put the pistol down.

906
01:08:16,051 --> 01:08:18,094
You know what happens
when the food and water runs out?

907
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:20,179
Do as the captain says, Coffin!

908
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:21,722
I just wanna see the landsman scared.

909
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,557
Mr. Coffin, put the pistol down.
That's an order!

910
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,060
- Do as the captain says! Now!
- Say it!

911
01:08:26,228 --> 01:08:27,228
- Henry.
- Say it!

912
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:29,355
Say it!

913
01:08:29,815 --> 01:08:30,856
Henry!

914
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,025
Put the pistol down.

915
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:38,531
Henry!

916
01:08:39,408 --> 01:08:40,533
Put it down.

917
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,612
So east it was.

918
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,949
Back in the direction we'd come.

919
01:09:22,743 --> 01:09:25,745
Though only the sun
and compass told us so.

920
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,123
All directions looked the same.

921
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:32,543
Our hope was to catch
the Westerlies to Easter Island.

922
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:35,963
A journey of 3,000 miles.

923
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:39,300
In 12 days, we have drifted south.

924
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:41,886
Six degrees latitude.

925
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:45,348
We're not one mile closer
to Easter Island.

926
01:09:46,308 --> 01:09:47,600
We stayed in the same place.

927
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:52,438
We are cursed.

928
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:55,107
We'll make up for it
when we catch the variables.

929
01:09:58,403 --> 01:09:59,779
We'll catch them.

930
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:31,769
Chappel!

931
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:33,145
Chappel!

932
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:35,147
Chappel!

933
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:36,315
You've got him, Captain!

934
01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:44,031
Mr. Joy, the halyard's jammed!

935
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:51,247
Mr. Joy!
You all right, Mr. Joy?

936
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,168
Grab the tiller!

937
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,587
- Grab it!
- Matthew!

938
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,133
Get that sail down!

939
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,790
Matthew. Hey, what happened?

940
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,709
What happened?

941
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:38,669
Owen. What are you doing here?

942
01:11:39,004 --> 01:11:40,087
- Let me take a look.
- No, no, no.

943
01:11:40,255 --> 01:11:41,881
- Lay still. Let me look.
- Owen, I'm fine.

944
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:43,382
All right. Just relax. Relax.
Let me take a look.

945
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:44,550
- I'm fine!
- I know. I know.

946
01:11:44,718 --> 01:11:46,218
I just wanna take a look.

947
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:53,225
I banged my head.
Just a scratch, all right?

948
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,768
- Just a scratch.
- Give him some water.

949
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:58,022
- I don't need any water!
- Give him some goddamn water!

950
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:00,107
No, no, no. I don't need water. I'm fine.

951
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:08,991
- Yeah.
- Take that. Take it.

952
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,411
Hey. I got you, I got you.

953
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,998
You're all right. You're all right.

954
01:12:20,712 --> 01:12:23,005
Hey! What're you all looking at? I'm fine.

955
01:12:23,173 --> 01:12:25,007
Captain Pollard. Fit as a fiddle.

956
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:28,093
Fit as a goddamned fiddle. You hear me?

957
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,179
- Owen.
- Yeah.

958
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:31,555
I'm fine.

959
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:33,224
All right? I'm fine!

960
01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:37,603
- You're a tough son of a bitch.
- Thank you. I'm fine. Get out of here.

961
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:40,064
He's good.

962
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:42,316
Let's go.

963
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:46,237
Why waste water on a dead man?

964
01:12:46,655 --> 01:12:51,742
Them two men have known each other,
sailed together since childhood.

965
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:52,993
Now, tell me,

966
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:56,247
could you sit there and watch
your own brother die?

967
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:59,291
Simply a matter of numbers, Mr. Chappel.

968
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:02,711
There's not enough for all of us.

969
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:17,351
Why waste water on a dead man?

970
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:19,520
Why waste water on...

971
01:13:20,397 --> 01:13:22,982
Why waste water? Why waste?

972
01:13:23,692 --> 01:13:25,818
Why waste water on a dead man?

973
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:27,528
Mr. Nickerson?

974
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:30,864
- Why waste water...
- You all right, sir?

975
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:34,326
- I cannot.
- Cannot what?

976
01:13:34,703 --> 01:13:36,161
No, you...

977
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:38,330
You have enough. More than enough.

978
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:40,124
But, sir, we've come so far.

979
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:41,625
We have come to an end.

980
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,085
We have an agreement, sir.

981
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:44,878
Take the money and leave!

982
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:46,338
The devil's bargain.

983
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:48,173
No, sir.

984
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:50,467
The devil loves unspoken secrets.

985
01:13:54,139 --> 01:13:56,348
Especially those that
fester in a man's soul.

986
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:00,185
What's yours?

987
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:20,706
I am not a great writer.

988
01:14:24,169 --> 01:14:25,502
I am not Hawthorne.

989
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,423
But from my first hearing of it,

990
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,051
this tale has haunted me.

991
01:14:33,887 --> 01:14:35,387
It consumes me.

992
01:14:36,723 --> 01:14:38,599
I fear if I do not write it,

993
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:42,102
then I should never write again.

994
01:14:43,605 --> 01:14:44,730
What else?

995
01:14:47,067 --> 01:14:48,734
I fear if I do write it,

996
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:53,280
that it will not be
as good as it should be.

997
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:05,542
Continue the story, sir.

998
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:08,462
For the both of us.

999
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:26,855
Pass that down.

1000
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:32,778
Thank you, sir.

1001
01:15:38,118 --> 01:15:40,786
We thank you, Lord, for this is our food.

1002
01:15:41,121 --> 01:15:42,246
I'm sorry.

1003
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:44,581
For life and health,

1004
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:46,542
and every good.

1005
01:15:46,835 --> 01:15:48,502
- Let all manner to...
- Land.

1006
01:15:49,129 --> 01:15:50,212
Land!

1007
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:53,799
- Land! Land!
- Land!

1008
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:56,802
- Land!
- Land!

1009
01:15:57,137 --> 01:16:00,097
Oars! Give way! Give way!

1010
01:16:01,266 --> 01:16:04,268
Oars! Now! Give way! Row!

1011
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:14,153
- I saw it, Mr. Chase.
- That you did, boy.

1012
01:16:24,122 --> 01:16:26,999
Hold fast.
Hold fast! Hold fast!

1013
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:31,003
- Mr. Chase, sir. What is it?
- Mr. Chase!

1014
01:16:31,463 --> 01:16:33,839
What the devil is it?
Why have you stopped?

1015
01:16:34,174 --> 01:16:35,466
He's been following us!

1016
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,593
What is he talking about?

1017
01:16:38,136 --> 01:16:39,636
There's nothing out there,
Mr. Chase!

1018
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,181
- There ain't nothing out there, sir!
- Sir, what are you doing?

1019
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,071
Brace! Brace! Brace!

1020
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:01,158
No!

1021
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:26,183
Where is he?

1022
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,390
This could be Ducie Island.

1023
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:33,769
Without a map, compass or quadrant,
there's no way to be certain.

1024
01:19:34,354 --> 01:19:36,647
We will keep fires going night and day.

1025
01:19:37,357 --> 01:19:40,567
Hope a passing ship
catches sight of our smoke.

1026
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:39,042
This is what I wanted you to see.

1027
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:49,886
They've been here a long time, no doubt.

1028
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:52,764
Waiting for a ship.

1029
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:55,434
But no ship came.

1030
01:20:57,437 --> 01:20:59,312
No ship is going to come.

1031
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:01,773
If we stay, we die.

1032
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:05,068
How long do you think
it'll take the tropic birds

1033
01:21:05,445 --> 01:21:07,821
to stop coming here once
they see their eggs eaten?

1034
01:21:26,674 --> 01:21:29,718
It's a privilege to know
the moment of one's death in advance,

1035
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:32,262
be able to prepare for it.

1036
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:36,308
Curse to be so far from home

1037
01:21:37,977 --> 01:21:39,644
without a chance to say goodbyes,

1038
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:42,022
without a chance to make peace,

1039
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:44,858
without a chance to settle the scores.

1040
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:51,823
Then let us at least settle
those between us, Captain.

1041
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,036
Captain of what?

1042
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,331
The Essex was lost
through no fault of yours.

1043
01:21:59,499 --> 01:22:00,665
I was as much to blame for...

1044
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,626
You are not the captain.

1045
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:09,674
But you were born to do this job.

1046
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:12,677
I was just born into it.

1047
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:27,859
What do we do, do you think, George?

1048
01:22:29,237 --> 01:22:32,697
And what offense did we give God
to upset him so?

1049
01:22:33,324 --> 01:22:34,908
The only creature to have
offended God here

1050
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:36,076
is the whale.

1051
01:22:37,078 --> 01:22:38,370
Not us?

1052
01:22:40,206 --> 01:22:43,500
In our arrogance, our greed,
look where we find ourselves.

1053
01:22:43,835 --> 01:22:46,837
We are supreme creatures
made in God's own likeness.

1054
01:22:47,839 --> 01:22:50,549
Earthly kings whose business it is

1055
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:52,926
to circumnavigate
the planet bestowed to us.

1056
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:55,762
To bend nature to our will.

1057
01:22:56,305 --> 01:23:00,308
You really feel like an earthly king
after everything that we've been through?

1058
01:23:01,269 --> 01:23:03,061
We're nothing. We're...

1059
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:05,564
We're specks. And dust.

1060
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:08,900
We sail into the sun at dawn.

1061
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:16,408
If we are to die,
then with God's grace, let us die as men.

1062
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:29,588
Are we ready, Mr. Weeks?

1063
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:30,797
Aye, sir.

1064
01:23:38,389 --> 01:23:39,890
Mr. Chappel?

1065
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:41,266
Mr. Wright?

1066
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:43,101
I can't do it, sir.

1067
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,729
Me, Wrights and Weeks,

1068
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:48,148
we're staying.

1069
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,450
You ready to go, Matthew?

1070
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:10,921
I'll give you a hand.
Here, you gotta get up.

1071
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:12,464
No, there's no point. You hear me?

1072
01:24:12,632 --> 01:24:14,466
No, we're going home.
We're going home.

1073
01:24:14,634 --> 01:24:15,967
There's no point.

1074
01:24:16,928 --> 01:24:18,470
Just go.

1075
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:23,975
God damn it, Matthew.

1076
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,146
It's all right.

1077
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,858
Well, I'll send a boat for you
the minute we get back.

1078
01:24:32,026 --> 01:24:34,361
Then we'll play cards
back in Nantucket, all right?

1079
01:24:34,654 --> 01:24:35,779
Yeah.

1080
01:24:35,947 --> 01:24:37,656
- It's a deal.
- Good.

1081
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:46,790
You want me to open that for you?

1082
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:48,041
Ah...

1083
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:52,170
I think I'll manage.

1084
01:24:53,214 --> 01:24:54,506
If it comes to that.

1085
01:24:58,511 --> 01:25:00,220
God be with you, brother.

1086
01:25:01,973 --> 01:25:03,431
Yeah, and you.

1087
01:25:22,535 --> 01:25:24,035
Brother Peterson?

1088
01:25:25,579 --> 01:25:27,205
Y'all coming with us?

1089
01:25:27,915 --> 01:25:28,915
Mr. Peterson.

1090
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:31,376
Why don't you come in our boat
with Mr. Bond here?

1091
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,494
Where... Where is he?

1092
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:09,539
Pollard?

1093
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:13,209
Mr. Lawrence. Mr. Lawrence, wake up.

1094
01:26:14,545 --> 01:26:16,129
Where's the other boat gone?

1095
01:26:17,048 --> 01:26:18,798
- Pollard!
- Captain Pollard!

1096
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:21,801
- Captain Pollard!
- Captain Pollard, sir!

1097
01:26:22,261 --> 01:26:23,803
- Pollard.
- Captain!

1098
01:26:24,722 --> 01:26:26,306
Captain Pollard!

1099
01:26:29,352 --> 01:26:30,477
Pollard!

1100
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:36,358
What's the matter?

1101
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:53,958
Benjamin. What are you doing?

1102
01:26:54,752 --> 01:26:56,002
He's dead.

1103
01:26:56,587 --> 01:26:58,004
Putting him overboard, sir.

1104
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:01,925
Look at me.

1105
01:27:02,093 --> 01:27:03,134
Look at me, Benjamin.

1106
01:27:08,599 --> 01:27:12,268
No right-minded sailor discards
what might yet save him.

1107
01:27:23,489 --> 01:27:25,490
Listen to me, boy. Listen to me.

1108
01:27:29,829 --> 01:27:31,329
He can help us.

1109
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,748
My God. My heavenly king.

1110
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:37,669
Sweetness is the power of his grace.

1111
01:27:37,837 --> 01:27:39,003
With longing eyes,

1112
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:42,382
thy creatures await on thee
for daily food.

1113
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:45,927
My soul is dead.

1114
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:01,860
So it was decided.

1115
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,702
We prepared the body.

1116
01:28:13,706 --> 01:28:15,748
We removed the organs.

1117
01:28:18,586 --> 01:28:21,254
Separated his limbs from his body

1118
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:25,467
and cut all the flesh from the bones.

1119
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:31,222
After which,

1120
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:34,142
we closed the body

1121
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:36,728
and we sewed it up

1122
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:39,731
as decently as we could

1123
01:28:40,316 --> 01:28:42,567
and committed it to the sea.

1124
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:46,446
We ate the heart first.

1125
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,498
You judge me.

1126
01:28:58,751 --> 01:28:59,792
No.

1127
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,425
There.

1128
01:29:08,302 --> 01:29:09,469
There.

1129
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:11,763
It is done.

1130
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:15,767
It is out.

1131
01:29:17,603 --> 01:29:19,187
And you've never told anyone?

1132
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:22,815
No.

1133
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:25,818
Not even your wife?

1134
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,531
Do you think she could ever love me

1135
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:32,784
if she knew the abominations
I had committed?

1136
01:29:32,952 --> 01:29:34,869
Yes. She would.

1137
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:39,791
And if you had told me
the story when we met,

1138
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:43,336
I would still wear your ring today.

1139
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:47,048
The strength of that boy

1140
01:29:47,466 --> 01:29:49,300
still lives in you.

1141
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:52,387
I see that.

1142
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:55,223
Even if you don't.

1143
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:19,539
You can finish your story now, my love.

1144
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:36,639
Hey, sit up.

1145
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:41,436
Listen,

1146
01:30:42,563 --> 01:30:44,063
put your head back.

1147
01:30:46,233 --> 01:30:48,901
Look, we still got
a few drops of water left.

1148
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:52,405
Don't you quit on me.
We're going home.

1149
01:30:57,911 --> 01:31:01,914
Do you have a family back home, Mr. Chase?

1150
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:03,791
Yeah, I have a wife.

1151
01:31:07,046 --> 01:31:09,422
Yes, and a son or a daughter.

1152
01:31:54,885 --> 01:31:55,927
Very well.

1153
01:31:58,138 --> 01:32:00,139
- Captain.
- We will draw again.

1154
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:02,058
We will do no such thing.

1155
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:04,227
We'll draw again.

1156
01:32:05,062 --> 01:32:06,521
Mr. Ramsdell,

1157
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:08,940
you will assume command of this vessel.

1158
01:32:11,819 --> 01:32:13,069
Cousin, will you?

1159
01:32:14,863 --> 01:32:15,905
You're our...

1160
01:32:16,073 --> 01:32:18,366
You're our captain.
The men need you.

1161
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:21,619
The men will be fine.

1162
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:24,038
Please.

1163
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:26,165
Please. Please.

1164
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:28,376
- Henry.
- Let us draw again.

1165
01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:30,837
It is an order.

1166
01:32:32,756 --> 01:32:34,173
If you cannot do it,

1167
01:32:34,341 --> 01:32:36,175
pass the pistol to another man.

1168
01:33:04,371 --> 01:33:05,705
Henry, no, no, no!

1169
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:18,009
You gotta help me, kid.
You gotta help me.

1170
01:33:21,847 --> 01:33:23,556
We were weeks in the doldrums.

1171
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:26,392
That part of the Pacific
is more desert than ocean.

1172
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:29,562
The sun beating down.

1173
01:33:30,481 --> 01:33:31,606
My fear.

1174
01:33:33,484 --> 01:33:34,984
All I could think about

1175
01:33:36,779 --> 01:33:38,279
was that everyone would die,

1176
01:33:38,447 --> 01:33:40,156
and I'd be the last left alive.

1177
01:33:41,742 --> 01:33:45,536
And as best Mr. Chase could tell,
we were still 800 miles from land.

1178
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:53,211
Mr. Chase.

1179
01:33:59,968 --> 01:34:01,052
Ah.

1180
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:02,845
Captain Pollard.

1181
01:34:05,474 --> 01:34:06,891
I am happy to see you.

1182
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:10,311
Been very little happiness
in our survival.

1183
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:13,981
Or in ours, sir.

1184
01:34:15,234 --> 01:34:16,776
Barzillai?

1185
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,113
The third boat?

1186
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:23,241
They've, uh...

1187
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:26,452
They've been gone for days.

1188
01:34:27,371 --> 01:34:28,955
I'm afraid they're lost, sir.

1189
01:34:58,777 --> 01:35:00,778
Mr. Chase,
you have the best position.

1190
01:35:17,713 --> 01:35:19,130
It's just a whale.

1191
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:24,385
He's there! Throw the lance!

1192
01:35:25,596 --> 01:35:26,637
Throw it!

1193
01:35:31,643 --> 01:35:34,687
- Throw it! Throw the lance!
- Come on.

1194
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:47,074
Throw it!

1195
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:48,618
Come on.

1196
01:35:57,127 --> 01:35:59,086
Kill it! He's there!

1197
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:00,880
Throw the lance!

1198
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:21,192
Why didn't you kill it?

1199
01:36:47,928 --> 01:36:49,553
You're a damn fool.

1200
01:37:13,412 --> 01:37:14,870
Currents drew us apart

1201
01:37:16,873 --> 01:37:20,167
and that was the last we would see
of Captain Pollard's whale boat.

1202
01:37:23,005 --> 01:37:24,213
A boat!

1203
01:37:25,507 --> 01:37:27,216
Broad on the port bow!

1204
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:54,452
May God have mercy.

1205
01:38:37,496 --> 01:38:38,662
Mr. Chase.

1206
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:43,042
Father!

1207
01:38:44,878 --> 01:38:47,171
Don't leave me, Father!

1208
01:39:38,014 --> 01:39:39,431
Mr. Chase.

1209
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:42,393
Mr. Chase.

1210
01:39:42,561 --> 01:39:44,895
Sir, look. Look, sir.

1211
01:39:48,567 --> 01:39:51,402
Mr. Chase, look.

1212
01:39:52,821 --> 01:39:54,572
Wake up, Mr. Chase!

1213
01:39:55,407 --> 01:39:56,615
Here, wake up!

1214
01:39:58,201 --> 01:40:00,369
Please wake up, sir, there's land.

1215
01:40:01,246 --> 01:40:02,830
Mr. Chase, look.

1216
01:40:23,143 --> 01:40:24,602
We were rescued there,

1217
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:27,688
off the island of Más Afuera, Chile,

1218
01:40:28,982 --> 01:40:31,567
90 days after the sinking of the Essex.

1219
01:40:33,445 --> 01:40:35,279
They gave us some old clothes.

1220
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:36,822
Fed us, too.

1221
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:40,409
It was hard to eat at first.

1222
01:40:40,577 --> 01:40:41,785
Strange.

1223
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:45,414
They looked after us as best they could

1224
01:40:45,582 --> 01:40:47,833
till we found a ship
that would carry us home.

1225
01:40:49,419 --> 01:40:51,253
That voyage took another three months.

1226
01:41:00,931 --> 01:41:04,016
It looked like the whole island
turned out to see us return.

1227
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:07,102
But there were no cheers.

1228
01:41:08,230 --> 01:41:09,438
Only silence.

1229
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:14,360
They looked at us like
we were apparitions,

1230
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:16,737
phantoms.

1231
01:41:17,906 --> 01:41:21,992
We'd said nothing of the details
of our survival to anyone,

1232
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:25,204
but I wondered if they somehow
knew of our privations.

1233
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,666
Maybe they were just curious.

1234
01:42:08,206 --> 01:42:09,707
Oh, my God!

1235
01:42:17,132 --> 01:42:18,507
I promised, didn't I?

1236
01:42:26,683 --> 01:42:27,891
Oh, God.

1237
01:42:29,686 --> 01:42:30,728
Hi.

1238
01:42:32,147 --> 01:42:33,856
Hey, sweetie. Who's this?

1239
01:42:35,317 --> 01:42:36,442
Phoebe Ann.

1240
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:42,573
Phoebe Ann Chase, huh?

1241
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:45,326
This is Daddy.

1242
01:42:47,329 --> 01:42:48,579
Hey, sweetie.

1243
01:42:53,918 --> 01:42:55,377
It's your daddy.

1244
01:43:03,345 --> 01:43:04,636
Oh, my God.

1245
01:43:12,729 --> 01:43:14,438
Of course,
they couldn't leave him alone.

1246
01:43:15,273 --> 01:43:18,317
Mr. Chase and his wife had
scarcely walked a block towards home

1247
01:43:18,485 --> 01:43:21,779
when he was stopped and
made to return to the Maritime office.

1248
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:26,033
There were business matters
still in question.

1249
01:43:39,798 --> 01:43:41,256
So, to the matter.

1250
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:49,348
Due to the significant loss of life
and property on our voyage,

1251
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,850
it seems there will be an inquiry.

1252
01:43:52,811 --> 01:43:54,061
And as captain and first mate,

1253
01:43:54,229 --> 01:43:56,188
we will be expected to give an account

1254
01:43:56,356 --> 01:43:57,648
of what happened.

1255
01:43:57,816 --> 01:43:59,066
Yes, of course.

1256
01:43:59,234 --> 01:44:03,654
And having discussed this
with the ship owners and my father,

1257
01:44:04,823 --> 01:44:08,534
it is clear that full disclosure
will have ramifications.

1258
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:11,495
Terrible ramifications
for the whole industry.

1259
01:44:12,914 --> 01:44:15,165
That a whale brought down the Essex.

1260
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:17,793
But it's the truth.

1261
01:44:25,969 --> 01:44:27,970
If the insurance houses and investors

1262
01:44:28,138 --> 01:44:32,975
were to start worrying
about sea monsters sinking ships,

1263
01:44:33,143 --> 01:44:35,352
sailors drawing lots to survive...

1264
01:44:37,105 --> 01:44:38,689
We are in the oil business.

1265
01:44:39,441 --> 01:44:40,649
All of us.

1266
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:42,484
And as in any business,

1267
01:44:42,652 --> 01:44:46,196
the probability of success must
always be greater than the risk incurred.

1268
01:44:48,741 --> 01:44:50,784
So, what are you suggesting, George?

1269
01:44:51,161 --> 01:44:53,036
That you say the ship ran aground.

1270
01:44:54,122 --> 01:44:55,205
That's a lie.

1271
01:44:55,457 --> 01:44:58,542
- And that the men that died, drowned.
- And that's another lie.

1272
01:44:58,835 --> 01:45:00,127
Think on it. They will make you captain.

1273
01:45:00,295 --> 01:45:02,379
Well, that pledge I already have
in writing.

1274
01:45:02,547 --> 01:45:06,049
Only on the condition
you bring home a ship full of oil.

1275
01:45:08,011 --> 01:45:09,261
This way, it's guaranteed.

1276
01:45:09,554 --> 01:45:11,430
You would be a wealthy man.

1277
01:45:12,265 --> 01:45:14,975
The name Chase need
no longer be a landsman's name,

1278
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:16,393
but an established name

1279
01:45:16,561 --> 01:45:19,271
that belongs among the great families
of Nantucket.

1280
01:45:20,732 --> 01:45:22,941
You want me to whitewash
what happened for profit?

1281
01:45:23,902 --> 01:45:26,695
We are asking you to be pragmatic.

1282
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:44,755
The Essex was stove by a white whale.

1283
01:45:46,007 --> 01:45:48,926
And those of us that survived
in ill-equipped whaleboats

1284
01:45:49,093 --> 01:45:52,054
had to commit abominations
in order to survive.

1285
01:45:53,348 --> 01:45:56,975
And, on our return,
we're expected to spread barefaced lies

1286
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:00,229
so that you,
the ship owners of Nantucket,

1287
01:46:01,272 --> 01:46:04,191
might line your pockets
and sleep well at night?

1288
01:46:05,443 --> 01:46:07,444
Well, I will not embroider the truth.

1289
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:10,447
Nor should you, George.

1290
01:46:29,968 --> 01:46:32,302
That last time I saw him...

1291
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:33,720
Mr. Chase, sir!

1292
01:46:34,472 --> 01:46:37,224
I couldn't find the right words
to say what I wanted to.

1293
01:46:38,309 --> 01:46:39,309
Thomas.

1294
01:46:40,728 --> 01:46:42,437
Perhaps there are no words.

1295
01:46:42,772 --> 01:46:43,814
Um...

1296
01:46:44,941 --> 01:46:48,485
I'm gonna be on my way to Falmouth and...

1297
01:46:51,197 --> 01:46:52,406
It's...

1298
01:46:53,408 --> 01:46:56,952
It's been an honor, sir,
to sail with you.

1299
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,041
The honor's been mine, Mr. Nickerson.

1300
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:21,351
Here.

1301
01:47:27,025 --> 01:47:28,567
Good luck out there, Thomas.

1302
01:47:30,278 --> 01:47:31,528
And you, sir.

1303
01:48:00,725 --> 01:48:03,518
Next day, George Pollard was called
before the inquiry.

1304
01:48:08,441 --> 01:48:09,941
Gentlemen, Captain George Pollard.

1305
01:48:11,361 --> 01:48:13,195
And all the important men
in Nantucket were there.

1306
01:48:14,906 --> 01:48:16,531
It was a formality.

1307
01:48:17,992 --> 01:48:20,827
Good day to you, Captain.
Please sit down.

1308
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:27,125
For the record, then...

1309
01:48:29,587 --> 01:48:32,089
The Essex was stove by a white whale

1310
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:34,591
1,200 leagues west of Ecuador.

1311
01:48:35,134 --> 01:48:37,886
It was as if Owen Chase himself
had spoken.

1312
01:48:39,931 --> 01:48:41,264
Told them the truth.

1313
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:47,562
Captain Pollard's conscience was clear.

1314
01:48:49,148 --> 01:48:50,273
But the inquiry was a sham.

1315
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:54,194
Pollard went out again,

1316
01:48:57,573 --> 01:48:59,157
looking for the white whale.

1317
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:01,118
He never found it.

1318
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:05,038
He ran a second ship aground off Hawaii.

1319
01:49:06,541 --> 01:49:07,791
Twice cursed.

1320
01:49:09,627 --> 01:49:10,669
Never sailed again.

1321
01:49:11,254 --> 01:49:12,337
And Owen Chase?

1322
01:49:14,298 --> 01:49:16,007
He was a man of his word.

1323
01:49:16,843 --> 01:49:19,136
First, he sent a boat back
to Ducie Island.

1324
01:49:20,638 --> 01:49:22,055
Mr. Joy had passed.

1325
01:49:22,765 --> 01:49:25,976
But the other three were,
incredibly, still alive.

1326
01:49:28,938 --> 01:49:30,188
And then?

1327
01:49:31,107 --> 01:49:34,484
And then he packed up his family
and moved to New Bedford.

1328
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:37,988
Started over.

1329
01:49:38,823 --> 01:49:40,240
Became a merchant captain,

1330
01:49:41,159 --> 01:49:43,160
sailing on his own terms.

1331
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:55,714
Well, you certainly got your
money's worth, Mr. Melville.

1332
01:49:56,299 --> 01:49:58,759
These February nights
are the longest of the year.

1333
01:49:58,926 --> 01:50:00,844
Well, you can both rest now.

1334
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:02,387
Believe me,

1335
01:50:02,555 --> 01:50:04,681
I shall not be resting for some time.

1336
01:50:05,475 --> 01:50:06,683
Why?

1337
01:50:07,685 --> 01:50:09,269
You got your story.

1338
01:50:09,854 --> 01:50:12,355
You know, your plot. It's all there.

1339
01:50:12,857 --> 01:50:16,151
Maybe it wasn't a plot I was after.

1340
01:50:16,861 --> 01:50:18,528
No. What, then?

1341
01:50:19,363 --> 01:50:22,824
- Something else you've given me tonight.
- And what's that?

1342
01:50:23,910 --> 01:50:27,788
The courage to go where
one does not want to go.

1343
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:31,416
Mr. Melville,

1344
01:50:32,126 --> 01:50:34,544
what you've heard, what I've told you,

1345
01:50:37,715 --> 01:50:41,718
will it all be of service to your book?

1346
01:50:43,387 --> 01:50:46,473
It will be a work of fiction,
Mr. Nickerson,

1347
01:50:47,809 --> 01:50:49,434
inspired by truth.

1348
01:50:51,145 --> 01:50:54,231
But I don't believe
I'll feel the need to use all of it.

1349
01:51:03,407 --> 01:51:05,283
- Thank you.
- Here.

1350
01:51:05,451 --> 01:51:08,745
- Take that with you.
- No. The money is for you. I insist.

1351
01:51:09,914 --> 01:51:11,581
I insist you keep it.

1352
01:51:11,749 --> 01:51:15,502
And I insist one person
in this conversation is sober.

1353
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:29,099
- So it's back to, uh...
- Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

1354
01:51:30,017 --> 01:51:31,476
Well, good luck.

1355
01:51:33,271 --> 01:51:34,437
Thank you.

1356
01:51:38,067 --> 01:51:39,276
You know,

1357
01:51:40,152 --> 01:51:43,530
I heard a man from Pennsylvania
drilled a hole in the ground recently

1358
01:51:44,615 --> 01:51:46,116
and found oil.

1359
01:51:46,742 --> 01:51:47,951
That can't be true.

1360
01:51:48,744 --> 01:51:49,911
I heard it, too.

1361
01:51:52,540 --> 01:51:54,124
Oil from the ground.

1362
01:51:56,544 --> 01:51:57,878
Fancy that.

1363
02:01:40,169 --> 02:01:41,169
