1
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:34,782
<i>Michael.</i>

2
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,886
<i>Dear Michael. Of course it's you.</i>
<i>Who else could they send?</i>

3
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:39,385
<i>Who else could be trusted?</i>

4
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:42,286
<i>And I know it's a long way</i>
<i>and you're ready to go to work.</i>

5
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,758
<i>All I'm saying is wait, just wait, just--</i>
<i>Just please hear me out.</i>

6
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:49,126
<i>Because this is not an episode,</i>
<i>relapse, fuckup.</i>

7
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,859
<i>I'm begging you, Michael,</i>
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

8
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,868
<i>Try and make believe</i>
<i>this is not just madness...</i>

9
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:58,064
<i>...because this is not just madness.</i>

10
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:00,672
<i>Two weeks ago,</i>
<i>I came out of the building, okay?</i>

11
00:01:00,844 --> 00:01:03,369
<i>I'm running across 6th Avenue,</i>
<i>there's a car waiting...</i>

12
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:06,743
<i>...I got exactly 38 minutes to get</i>
<i>to the airport, and I'm dictating.</i>

13
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,680
<i>There's this panicked associate</i>
<i>sprinting along beside me...</i>

14
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:12,378
<i>...scribbling in a notepad,</i>
<i>and she starts screaming.</i>

15
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:15,490
<i>And I realize we're standing</i>
<i>in the middle of the street...</i>

16
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:19,651
<i>...the light's changed and there's this wall</i>
<i>of serious traffic speeding towards us.</i>

17
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,854
<i>And I freeze. I can't move.</i>

18
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:24,659
<i>I'm suddenly consumed</i>
<i>with the overwhelming sensation...</i>

19
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,859
<i>...that I'm covered</i>
<i>with some sort of film.</i>

20
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:31,632
<i>And it's in my hair, in my face.</i>
<i>And it's like a glaze, like a coating.</i>

21
00:01:31,808 --> 00:01:34,572
<i>And at first I thought,</i>
<i>"Oh, my God, I know what this is.</i>

22
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:37,178
<i>This is some sort of amniotic,</i>
<i>embryonic fluid.</i>

23
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,042
<i>I'm drenched in afterbirth.</i>

24
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:41,877
<i>I've breached the chrysalis.</i>
<i>I've been reborn. "</i>

25
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:45,350
<i>But then, the traffic, the stampede,</i>
<i>the cars, the trucks, the horns...</i>

26
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:49,549
<i>...this poor woman screaming,</i>
<i>and I'm thinking, "No. This is not rebirth.</i>

27
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:52,593
<i>This is some kind of giddy illusion</i>
<i>of renewal...</i>

28
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:55,526
<i>...that happens in</i>
<i>the final moment before death. "</i>

29
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:59,293
<i>And then I realize,</i>
<i>"No, no, no, this is completely wrong"...</i>

30
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:02,438
<i>...because I looked back</i>
<i>at the building...</i>

31
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:05,233
<i>...and I had the most stunning</i>
<i>moment of clarity.</i>

32
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:07,501
<i>I realized, Michael...</i>

33
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:11,704
<i>...that I had emerged, not through</i>
<i>the doors of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen...</i>

34
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,180
<i>...not through the portals</i>
<i>of our vast and powerful law firm...</i>

35
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:18,149
<i>...but from the asshole of an organism...</i>

36
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:22,951
<i>...whose sole function is</i>
<i>to excrete the poison...</i>

37
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:26,493
<i>...the ammo, the defoliant necessary</i>
<i>for other larger...</i>

38
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:30,224
<i>...more powerful organisms</i>
<i>to destroy the miracle of humanity.</i>

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,268
<i>And that I had been coated</i>
<i>in this patina of shit...</i>

40
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:36,632
<i>...for the best part of my life.</i>

41
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:40,640
<i>And the stench of it, the stain of it</i>
<i>would take the rest of my life to undo.</i>

42
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,072
<i>And you know what I did?</i>

43
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,976
<i>I took a deep, cleansing breath</i>
<i>and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

44
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:50,552
<i>I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,</i>
<i>as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

45
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,918
<i>...as true a thing as I believe</i>
<i>that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

46
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,559
<i>It must stand the test of time. "</i>

47
00:02:57,727 --> 00:03:00,753
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

48
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,234
I'm not sure what else I can tell you
that I haven't already.

49
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,927
<i>Tell me about U/North, Barry.</i>
<i>They're your clients.</i>

50
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:13,337
<i>So you tell me why you're settling</i>
<i>a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.</i>

51
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:16,205
<i>Because I'm writing this story</i>
<i>whether you like it or not.</i>

52
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,710
What does that exactly mean?

53
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,281
<i>Give me something I can print.</i>

54
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,053
We found 97.

55
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,760
I've got that cunt from
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> on my cell phone.

56
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:41,096
She will not go away.

57
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:46,064
Marty Bach. How can I help you?

58
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:49,336
<i>Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein.</i>
<i>We're going with a story tomorrow...</i>

59
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:52,743
<i>...about a settlement in the U/North</i>
<i>defoliant case. You wanna comment?</i>

60
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:56,283
Case you're referring to is now,
as it has been for the past six years...

61
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,317
...pending and unresolved.

62
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,082
Till such time as our client
has their day in court...

63
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:04,749
...or the plaintiffs drop the suit,
I'll have nothing of value to tell you.

64
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:07,988
<i>Come on, Marty, you're closing</i>
<i>the U/North case. You're settling.</i>

65
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:12,624
<i>I know that. I know you're up there with</i>
<i>600 people jamming this thing through.</i>

66
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:15,236
Here's what I know.
Your deadline was 20 minutes ago.

67
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:18,897
So you're fishing for a story or
trying to get out of writing a retraction.

68
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:21,566
In either case,
I wish you the best of luck.

69
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,704
Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?

70
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:15,186
I'll see the turn.

71
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:22,728
Check.

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,502
Check.

73
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,240
Check.

74
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,401
Half the pot. Two hundred.

75
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,274
Two hundred to go.

76
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:43,654
You don't remember me, huh?

77
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:47,155
We played together a couple times.

78
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,423
That lamp place on Bowery.

79
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,261
That guy's showroom?
All the lamps and shit?

80
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:54,837
-The Galaxy.
-That's it.

81
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:58,201
You had a restaurant
you were opening, right?

82
00:05:58,374 --> 00:06:01,605
My old partner bid that job,
the plumbing.

83
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:05,178
-You don't remember me?
-I remember you.

84
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:07,612
Because I lost a lot of weight since then.

85
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,114
You bought some hair too.

86
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,584
With your money.

87
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,853
So, what happened with the bar?

88
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:17,788
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

89
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,124
Shit, man. I want to listen to Larry King,
I go home and put the fucking TV on.

90
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,766
That was a good location.

91
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:27,767
Yeah, that's what my partner
kept telling me.

92
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,737
Action's on you.

93
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,136
I bet the pot.

94
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:36,708
Good to see you again.

95
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,501
Hello?

96
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,942
<i>-Michael.</i>
-Walter.

97
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:15,346
<i>Michael, thank God, there you are.</i>
<i>Look, I got a situation.</i>

98
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:19,614
<i>A big problem, all right? A client of mine,</i>
<i>he just called, he hit a guy with his car.</i>

99
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,689
<i>He thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.</i>

100
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,847
Just now?

101
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,687
<i>Yeah, just now. Ten, 1 5 minutes ago.</i>
<i>He's driving home.</i>

102
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,921
<i>He's home now. He's there waiting.</i>

103
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:29,257
Where?

104
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:33,266
<i>Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda.</i>
<i>He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.</i>

105
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:34,460
Is he drunk?

106
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:37,504
<i>No. It's the first thing I asked him.</i>
<i>He's good, he's sober.</i>

107
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:39,163
Tell him to stay off the phone.

108
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:41,606
<i>All right. But you're on it?</i>
<i>You can get up there?</i>

109
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,540
<i>Because this guy, he's a huge client.</i>

110
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:46,274
<i>This is half my book, this guy, okay?</i>

111
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:47,882
I'm walking to the car now.

112
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,417
<i>Okay. Look, look, let me call him right back</i>
<i>and I'll get the address.</i>

113
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:55,182
<i>Just let me know you're on the way,</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

114
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:56,791
All right. I'll be in the car.

115
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,144
<i>What they did, see,</i>
<i>they changed the grade there.</i>

116
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:55,113
They widened the street.

117
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,185
I'm sure somebody told them
that that was an improvement.

118
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:02,848
But now, you see, when it rains and when
there is fog, and with this new angle...

119
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:06,620
...and they've got these new--
These-- These--

120
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,889
These sodium lamps, it's blinding.

121
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:12,330
-That corner there. It is blinding.
-They'll have to work that out.

122
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:15,334
And it's not just tonight.
I've been saying this for years.

123
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:20,134
I mean, how many times have we talked
about that corner? Dell?

124
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,573
Mr. Greer, we don't have
a lot of time here.

125
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:27,682
So the circumstances, the road conditions,
none of this holds any interest for you?

126
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,751
What interests me is finding
the strongest criminal attorney...

127
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,512
...that can be here in 1 5 minutes.

128
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:35,922
Well, that sounds ominous.

129
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:38,652
We have some good relationships
up here in Westchester.

130
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,763
So, what are you? What are you?
You're not a lawyer?

131
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:43,728
-Not the kind you need.
-What kind is that?

132
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:44,888
A trial lawyer.

133
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:47,930
Somebody who can see this through.
That's not what I do.

134
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:51,665
Okay. I think we're gonna have to
pull Walter back in on this.

135
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,833
I wanna get Walter back on the phone,
get him back into the mix.

136
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,742
Because, I'll be frank with you,
I don't like the way this is going.

137
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:02,577
Sir, we don't have time for Walter.
Your options are gonna get smaller quickly.

138
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:04,811
What options?
I'm not hearing any options!

139
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:06,215
I suggest you go local...

140
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:09,256
...and I'm telling you there are
people here I like for this.

141
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:11,484
Great. That's it?
That's what you got for me?

142
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,686
Hey, you believe this?

143
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,161
I have been a client at Kenner, Bach
for 1 2 years!

144
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:20,063
You think I paid that retainer every month
for a place at the back of the line?

145
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:23,535
Mr. Greer, you left the scene of an accident
on a slow weeknight...

146
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,901
...six miles from
the state police barracks.

147
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:28,305
If there's a line,
you're right up front.

148
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:31,344
I can get a lawyer any time I want.
I don't need you for that.

149
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:35,416
We're not sitting here for 45 minutes
waiting for a goddamn referral!

150
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:37,347
I don't know what Walter
promised you--

151
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,978
A miracle worker! That's Walter
on the phone, 20 minutes ago.

152
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:44,251
Direct quote, okay? "Hang tight.
I'm sending you a miracle worker."

153
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:46,054
-Well, he misspoke.
-About what?

154
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,822
That you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're good at it?

155
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:50,465
Elliot.

156
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:53,926
The guy was running! In the street!

157
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:58,836
You take that, you add the fog,
you add the lamps, you add the angle....

158
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:03,835
What the fuck is he doing running in
the middle of the street at midnight?!

159
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:06,208
You answer me that!

160
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,928
What if someone had stolen the car?

161
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:26,262
Happens all the time.

162
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,528
Cops like hit-and-runs.

163
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:30,729
They work them hard,
they clear them fast.

164
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:34,103
Right now there's a B.C.I. unit
pulling paint chips off a guard rail.

165
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,609
Tomorrow, they're gonna be looking
for the owner of a custom-painted...

166
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,010
...hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-1 2.

167
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:41,774
And the guy you hit?

168
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,318
If he got a look at the plates,
it won't even take that long.

169
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,253
There's no play here.

170
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,392
There's no angle.
There's no champagne room.

171
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:56,224
I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor.

172
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:58,457
The math on this is simple.

173
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,626
The smaller the mess,
the easier it is for me to clean up.

174
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:06,902
That's the police, isn't it?

175
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:08,475
No.

176
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,972
They don't call.

177
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:17,083
Hello.

178
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,452
Jerry, it's Michael Clayton.

179
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:23,091
Yeah, look, I'm sorry to wake you up.

180
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:26,156
No. I'm in the neighborhood.

181
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:28,393
You got a pen?

182
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,979
Mom, where's my cards?

183
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:19,858
Where's my cards?

184
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,407
Is my other deck in here?

185
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,976
Did you eat?

186
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:39,046
Dad's down there waiting already.

187
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:41,079
There were cards in our bathroom.

188
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,512
Yes, I had a waffle.

189
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:45,552
Since we're out of waffles,
I don't see how that's possible.

190
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:47,052
It's a miracle.

191
00:16:50,826 --> 00:16:52,350
Gloves?

192
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:00,157
Henry!

193
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,339
Come on.

194
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:09,674
Get in.

195
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,278
Got it?

196
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,681
<i>So no one's even sure</i>
<i>exactly where they are...</i>

197
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:25,020
...because there's no borders
or landmarks or anything.

198
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:27,924
And the town?
It's not even a town really.

199
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:31,294
It just is this camp where all these people
have gathered to hide.

200
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,456
Right.

201
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:36,092
All these deserters and guys
that got cut off from their armies.

202
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:39,434
All these people that are hiding
in the woods, trying to stay alive.

203
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:41,508
This is where they all came.

204
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:44,669
There's Thieves, Gray Mages,
Unbidden Warriors...

205
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:46,872
...Dark Avians,
Riverwynders and Sappers.

206
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:50,212
-There's, like, 1 5 different characters, okay?
-Okay.

207
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,415
And nobody has any alliances.

208
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:55,853
You can't even say who you are
because, you don't know...

209
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:58,015
...maybe the person you're talking to...

210
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:00,684
...maybe they're like your mortal enemy
in the wars.

211
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:03,559
So it's just completely like
everybody for themselves.

212
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:05,063
Sounds familiar.

213
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:08,169
It's really good.
I'm serious, you should really read it.

214
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,500
Right. But by the time I finish it,
you'll be on to something else.

215
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,437
-How much you wanna bet?
-I don't know. How much you got?

216
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,441
-You got your bus pass?
-It's in my locker.

217
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:20,480
You're not even gonna look at it,
are you?

218
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:22,082
-The book?
-Yes.

219
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:23,650
Bring it on Saturday, I'll....

220
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:27,050
I did already. I left it in your kitchen.
It's got a red cover.

221
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:28,348
Okay.

222
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,924
Well, here we go.

223
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:33,789
Go. Teach these people something,
would you?

224
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,425
-See you later, Dad.
-Yeah, kiddo.

225
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,971
Thanks.

226
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:53,772
<i>Lot 52, lot of assorted mixing bowls,</i>
<i>assorted sizes.</i>

227
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:56,918
<i>Thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars.</i>
<i>Thirty dollars I have.</i>

228
00:18:57,085 --> 00:19:00,179
You can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50.
Sixty dollars back there.

229
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:02,585
Sixty dollars, get me to 70.
I got 70 dollars.

230
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:05,283
Seventy dollars, I have now, 70.
Eighty dollars there.

231
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,860
Eighty dollars, this gentleman here.
Eighty dollars.

232
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,760
Ninety dollars there. Give me 1 00.
One hundred I have now.

233
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:24,675
He says you're still gonna be short.

234
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:28,573
How short?

235
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,151
Sixty. Plus the points, 75 thousand.

236
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:35,381
-That's liquor and everything?
-What'd you think it was gonna be?

237
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:38,549
I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.

238
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:42,595
He took 1 500 on a refrigerator
I paid four grand for.

239
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,391
Make a bid.

240
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:48,625
Are you telling me you don't have
the 75 thousand?

241
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:50,863
Just lying around, no.

242
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,466
We both know it's your brother
I should be talking to.

243
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:56,668
Forget that.

244
00:19:56,845 --> 00:20:01,145
Michael, look, you wanna front this,
that's up to you.

245
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:04,547
But Timmy's name stays in the book
till we're clear.

246
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,320
If I know where he is,
I don't have to keep asking.

247
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:13,188
He's upstate. His wife took him back.
I don't know where he is.

248
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:15,159
He's gotta have something.

249
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,820
He's got the two kids with her.

250
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:20,662
He's got Jennifer, the coke-dealing waitress
that he knocked up.

251
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:25,500
He's got four Michelin radials
that he stole from my sister's garage.

252
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,571
Make an offer.

253
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:35,380
I had a wife who was a drunk.
She was a beautiful girl, young girl.

254
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,112
But live like that? Even they do a program--
She did, I think, once, two years.

255
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,280
And then they slip? Forget it.

256
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:44,823
It's like you're strapped to a bomb.

257
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,988
What's my timeframe here?

258
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:50,321
I don't know.

259
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,490
I didn't think it'd be a problem.

260
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:55,626
I'll ask.

261
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:25,360
-Hey, Michael.
-Morning, Carl.

262
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:36,873
I don't know. Del, I don't know
how hard you want me to press here.

263
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,036
Let me know how brave he wants to be.

264
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,546
<i>Well, I'm not sure how brave</i>
<i>he can be right now.</i>

265
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,049
<i>We just got a confirmation hearing</i>
<i>scheduled.</i>

266
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,618
Any chance she knows that?

267
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:49,416
<i>Well, it was in the paper. Who knows?</i>
<i>Maybe she got someone to read it to her.</i>

268
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:52,116
<i>She called his wife yesterday.</i>
<i>She's calling his house.</i>

269
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:53,522
<i>This is a total nightmare.</i>

270
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:55,822
Well, my guess is
she's gonna want the condo.

271
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:57,056
<i>Come on, that's insane.</i>

272
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,759
Well, what can I tell you?
Don't piss off a motivated stripper.

273
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:02,130
<i>It's just unbelievable.</i>

274
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:05,569
All right. Well, find out his pain threshold
and get back to me.

275
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,641
Or you can tell him to call me directly.

276
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:09,800
<i>All right, I hear you. Let me get into it.</i>

277
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:11,138
Thanks.

278
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:12,940
Hey, where are we with Marty?

279
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:15,439
We left word.

280
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:17,778
Hold on. Go back. How old is the kid?

281
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:19,944
<i>He's not a kid. He's 22.</i>

282
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:21,783
-This is Miami?
<i>-Nope. Key Biscayne.</i>

283
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:23,447
And they charged him.

284
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:26,924
<i>Reckless endangerment. My client....</i>

285
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:32,533
<i>I think really what they want, they want</i>
<i>a reality check on the attorney down there.</i>

286
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:34,760
-Yeah.
<i>-Wayne said you have some connections?</i>

287
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,461
-Yeah, let me get a pen.
<i>-Thank you.</i>

288
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,266
Now, if she calls the INS directly,
she's gonna get nowhere.

289
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,671
<i>Even with the appointment?</i>

290
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:45,335
It's retail, Evan.
It's like the DMV over there.

291
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:48,847
Unless they get a call from
a district supervisor, then nobody moves.

292
00:22:49,017 --> 00:22:50,575
<i>But your guy can do that?</i>

293
00:22:50,752 --> 00:22:52,083
He's a former commissioner.

294
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:55,189
<i>None of this comes back to me?</i>
<i>Because that doesn't do any good.</i>

295
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:57,450
No, look, I'm gonna be
the one that's asking.

296
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,958
<i>-Can you hang on a minute?</i>
-Yeah, sure.

297
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:03,060
Are we merging?

298
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:05,727
Marty Bach's in London.

299
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:08,995
They said he was in Atlanta,
then Lara said he was in the building.

300
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:11,298
So I called back.
I know you want this meeting.

301
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,033
Now she tells me the truth.
He's really in London.

302
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:17,406
So are we merging?
I mean, that's what everyone's saying.

303
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:19,706
All these Brits?
That this time it's for real.

304
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:21,678
Like I would know.

305
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,545
I don't know.

306
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:27,381
But even if we are, I mean, even if
they merged, it wouldn't affect us, right?

307
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,817
Your phone's ringing.

308
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:32,159
Evan?

309
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:35,692
Hey. Okay, here's what I'll do.

310
00:23:35,864 --> 00:23:38,833
Let me give him a call
and set up a meeting for next week.

311
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,400
I'll walk her in,
I'll make the introduction....

312
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,131
<i>At the moment,</i>
<i>U/North currently has 7 0,000 employees...</i>

313
00:23:45,307 --> 00:23:48,333
<i>...in 62 countries around the world.</i>

314
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:51,538
<i>Around the planet.</i>

315
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,412
<i>Operating in 62 countries</i>
<i>around the planet.</i>

316
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,252
At work in more than 60 countries
around the globe.

317
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:08,095
We have-- We have, right now--
We have--

318
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:11,494
At U/North right now,
we've got 75,000 employees...

319
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:14,430
...in over 60 countries around the planet.

320
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:17,367
We are a very successful
and highly diversified company...

321
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,268
...so you can imagine...

322
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:22,877
...the volume and the variety
of legal issues we have to deal with is--

323
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,511
Overwhelming.

324
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:27,914
It's just enormous.

325
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,715
So you can imagine,
the volume of legal issues....

326
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:35,285
It's quite substantial.

327
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:38,051
<i>And as general counsel, what I do...</i>

328
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,421
...what our in-house department does...

329
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:45,862
...is to analyze the dimension
of the problem or the opportunity...

330
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:48,366
...to determine the jurisdiction...

331
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:50,767
...and to outsource our business...

332
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:54,397
...to those firms and talents
that we think can help us the most.

333
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:57,437
<i>So with all that pressure and workload...</i>

334
00:24:57,612 --> 00:25:00,945
<i>...how do you keep a balance</i>
<i>between work and life?</i>

335
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:02,583
<i>Balance?</i>

336
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:08,418
I think that's.... That's something that...

337
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,923
...you search for your whole life, isn't it?

338
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,891
It's a shifting balance, really.

339
00:25:15,063 --> 00:25:18,226
It's, you know, you.... You try to....

340
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,699
<i>When you really are enjoying</i>
<i>what it is you do...</i>

341
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,735
...who needs balance?

342
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:27,330
There's your balance.
There's your balance.

343
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:31,468
When you're really enjoying
what it is you do, there is your balance.

344
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:33,807
When Don asked me to take--

345
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:36,450
When Don Jeffries brought--
Don Jeffries brought me--

346
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,587
Don Jeffries brought me in here
1 2 years ago...

347
00:25:39,754 --> 00:25:42,848
...trusted me, mentored me.

348
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:45,993
Welcomed me into the U/North family.

349
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:50,495
And when he moved up to the boardroom,
I never really...

350
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,826
...dreamt that I would have
the opportunity to move into his position.

351
00:25:55,003 --> 00:25:57,767
But, is it challenging? Yes.

352
00:25:57,939 --> 00:26:03,605
And I think that it's possible that those
first few months were a little shaky.

353
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:08,875
But then you realize that you've been
taught to be ready, and you take the helm.

354
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,043
Because if you're not comfortable
with that level of responsibility...

355
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:15,052
...you're in the wrong place.

356
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:20,320
It's your department, your capacity to
make tough decisions in real time, and--

357
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,925
We're in the middle of an interview.

358
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:25,066
They said it was urgent.

359
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:28,535
Jesus.

360
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:31,034
For chrissake.

361
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:34,472
You're saying he did this in--?

362
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:35,701
Oh, my God.

363
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:38,539
-Barry.
-Hang on.

364
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:44,178
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked
in a deposition room in Milwaukee.

365
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,518
<i>Oh, Michael...</i>

366
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:51,352
<i>...I took a deep, cleansing breath</i>
<i>and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

367
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:56,327
<i>I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,</i>
<i>as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

368
00:26:56,498 --> 00:27:00,264
<i>...as true a thing as I believe</i>
<i>that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

369
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:03,427
<i>It must stand the test of time. "</i>

370
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:06,369
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

371
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,999
<i>This moment, today,</i>
<i>here, this room, this air...</i>

372
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:14,581
<i>...and this, especially this, Michael,</i>
<i>that you're here.</i>

373
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:16,546
<i>There's a reason.</i>

374
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,413
<i>A reason it's you, Michael.</i>

375
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:23,080
<i>Surely, you have some sense of that,</i>
<i>how it pulls together, how it gathers.</i>

376
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:26,989
<i>Nurse Michael, the secret hero,</i>
<i>the keeper of the hidden sins.</i>

377
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:29,426
<i>Tell me you can see that, Michael,</i>
<i>for God's sake.</i>

378
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:34,732
But, I mean, yeah, yes, yes.
The nudity, the parking lot, I admit it.

379
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,600
It was-- It was-- It was a mistake.
It was wrong. It was lame.

380
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:41,867
It was obvious. And therapeutically,
it was completely useless...

381
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:45,410
...because I swear, I could stand here
and tear off my fucking skin...

382
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:50,311
...and I could not get down
to where this thing is living.

383
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:54,216
Six years, Michael.
Six years I've absorbed this poison.

384
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:57,654
Four hundred depositions,
a hundred motions, five changes of venue...

385
00:27:57,826 --> 00:28:00,260
...85,000 documents in discovery.

386
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:04,626
Six years of scheming and stalling
and screaming, and what have I got?

387
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,259
I've spent 1 2 percent of my life defending
the reputation of a deadly weed killer!

388
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,530
-We had an agreement, Arthur.
-One night.

389
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:14,641
One night, right?
I look up and there's Marty in my office.

390
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,140
He's got some champagne.

391
00:28:16,311 --> 00:28:21,078
He tells me we just hit 30,000 billable hours
on U/North and he wants to celebrate.

392
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:24,776
So an hour later, I find myself
in a whorehouse in Chelsea...

393
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:28,354
...with two Lithuanian redheads
taking turns sucking my dick.

394
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:32,619
I'm laying there and I'm trying not
to come and I wanna....

395
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,092
I wanna make it last,
so I start doing the math.

396
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:38,494
I think, "Thirty thousand hours,
what is that? That's 24 times 30.

397
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:43,763
That's 720 hours in a month,
8760 hours in a year...."

398
00:28:43,938 --> 00:28:45,496
-Arthur.
-No, wait, wait, wait!

399
00:28:45,673 --> 00:28:49,006
Because it's years! It's lives!

400
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:52,010
And the numbers are making me dizzy
and, you know...

401
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,378
...now, instead of trying not to come,
I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.

402
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:57,950
I mean, is this me?

403
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,453
Am I this freak organism that has been
sent here to sleep and eat...

404
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:06,822
...and defend this one horrific chain
of carcinogenic molecules?

405
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,986
Is that my destiny? Is that my fate?

406
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,394
-Listen, you promised me.
-Is that it, Michael?

407
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:14,535
Is that my grail?
Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?

408
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:17,262
Is that the correct answer
to the multiple choice of me?

409
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:20,636
You wanna go off your medication,
that's fine. But you call me first.

410
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:22,470
-That was our agreement.
-Sue me.

411
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:23,838
We okay in there?

412
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:27,543
We're fine. We're fine.

413
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:33,212
They killed them, Michael.

414
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:36,585
Those small farms, the family farms.

415
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:39,283
Did you--? Did you--?
Did you meet Anna?

416
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:40,485
No.

417
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:43,756
You gotta see her, you gotta talk to her.
She's a miracle, Michael.

418
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:45,923
She's God's perfect little creature.

419
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,536
And for 50 million dollars in fees,
I've spent 1 2 percent of my life...

420
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:53,333
...destroying perfect Anna
and her dead parents and her dying brother.

421
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:55,271
When did you last take one of these?

422
00:29:55,443 --> 00:29:58,173
No. I'm not losing this.
Everything is finally significant.

423
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:00,780
The world is a beautiful place.
I'm not trading that.

424
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:04,214
-If it's real, the pill won't kill it.
-I have blood on my hands.

425
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,047
You are senior litigating partner
of one of the largest...

426
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,918
...most respected law firms in the world.
You are a legend.

427
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:12,423
-I'm an accomplice!
-You're a manic-depressive.

428
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:15,896
I am Shiva, the god of death.

429
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:19,289
Let's get out of Milwaukee,
we'll talk about it.

430
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:25,432
<i>We came back from the hospital</i>
<i>and everybody was crying...</i>

431
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:29,634
<i>...and we were in shock, but we still....</i>
<i>We had to milk.</i>

432
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:32,245
<i>The cows won't wait, will they?</i>

433
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,402
<i>No.</i>

434
00:30:34,115 --> 00:30:36,606
<i>And when you went to the barn?</i>

435
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:39,378
<i>We found the note. My sister found it.</i>

436
00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:41,784
<i>-From your mother?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

437
00:30:41,956 --> 00:30:43,947
<i>Could you read it for us, please?</i>

438
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:48,288
<i>Just read the third paragraph,</i>
<i>just the highlighted section there.</i>

439
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,726
<i>"I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy</i>
<i>or any of the people-- "</i>

440
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,128
<i>Anna.</i>

441
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:55,564
<i>-Anna.</i>
<i>-"Down at--</i>

442
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:57,398
<i>It's all right, Anna, go on.</i>

443
00:30:57,572 --> 00:30:59,472
<i>-I'm just....</i>
<i>-Excuse me.</i>

444
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:01,734
<i>-Anna, they're....</i>
<i>-What's he doing?</i>

445
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,606
<i>Excuse me. She's a--</i>
<i>No, this is testimony. This is--</i>

446
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,770
<i>Excuse me, I have an objection.</i>

447
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,314
<i>You can be a witness here.</i>
<i>You can be a witness.</i>

448
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:11,179
<i>I am not a witness to this, sir, I--</i>

449
00:31:11,352 --> 00:31:13,946
<i>Anna, I love you.</i>

450
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:19,025
<i>And I'm sitting here</i>
<i>and I'm listening to you and I swear...</i>

451
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:23,960
<i>...that I love you more than anything</i>
<i>in the world. And this is my moment.</i>

452
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,932
<i>This strange conference-table moment.</i>

453
00:31:28,102 --> 00:31:30,002
<i>Turn off that camera!</i>

454
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:34,064
<i>-This is my offering!</i>
<i>-No, I want this on the record!</i>

455
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:35,470
<i>How do I turn it off?</i>

456
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,170
<i>This is my offering. My clothes are</i>
<i>my offering. This is my shame.</i>

457
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:42,111
<i>My credentials! I'm ashamed!</i>

458
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:45,684
<i>And I love you, and I swear to God--</i>

459
00:31:53,394 --> 00:31:54,952
I guess that's it.

460
00:32:02,136 --> 00:32:03,433
When do we get Don?

461
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:06,563
She said to try back in half an hour.

462
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:09,642
And how about the flights?
What's the story at O'Hare?

463
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:13,506
-Closed four minutes ago.
-Shit.

464
00:32:14,882 --> 00:32:17,282
There is a foot of snow
in Detroit already.

465
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:19,716
Todd, could I get that coffee now?

466
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:26,053
Who is this guy they sent from New York?
Clayton? I never heard of him.

467
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,295
Michael Raymond Clayton.

468
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:34,367
<i>Born September 9, 1 959,</i>
<i>St. Joseph's Hospital, Bronx, New York.</i>

469
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:38,232
<i>Father is NYPD patrolman</i>
<i>Raymond Xavier Clayton.</i>

470
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:41,068
<i>Mother, Alice Mary Clayton.</i>

471
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:44,405
<i>Graduates Washingtonville Central</i>
<i>High School, Orange County, New York...</i>

472
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:46,206
<i>...in 1 97 7.</i>

473
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:50,750
<i>Graduates St. John's University, 1 980.</i>
<i>Fordham Law, '82.</i>

474
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:55,913
<i>'82 through '86, he's ADA with</i>
<i>the Queens district attorney's office.</i>

475
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,025
<i>1 986, he's with</i>
<i>the Joint Manhattan-Queens...</i>

476
00:32:59,193 --> 00:33:01,127
<i>...Organized Crime Task Force.</i>

477
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:04,696
And then in 1 990, he starts
at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

478
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:06,299
So he's a partner?

479
00:33:07,201 --> 00:33:09,692
No. He's listed as special counsel.

480
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:11,896
Says he specializes in wills and trusts.

481
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:15,435
<i>He goes from criminal prosecution</i>
<i>to wills and trusts?</i>

482
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,976
<i>He's been there 1 7 years,</i>
<i>he's not a partner?</i>

483
00:33:18,146 --> 00:33:21,809
<i>This is the guy they send?</i>
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

484
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:38,328
-Hi.
-Close the door.

485
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,793
All right. So nobody, none of you,
had any idea he was coming?

486
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:45,236
To Milwaukee? For a deposition?

487
00:33:45,406 --> 00:33:48,967
We thought there was a settlement.
There's been some rumors.

488
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:53,739
Okay. Look, it's very simple.
Arthur has a chemical imbalance.

489
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:57,783
He's supposed to be taking his medication.
He's fallen behind on that.

490
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,443
He's on the mend.
He'll be fine in three or four days.

491
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:04,785
Now, I wanna make this crystal clear.
What happened here stays in this room.

492
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,928
This is not a piece of information
you wanna be out in front of.

493
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:11,395
Anybody has a problem with that,
I need to know right now.

494
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:13,898
All right.

495
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:16,600
We're stuck here overnight.

496
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:19,069
I'm gonna take him
home tomorrow if I can.

497
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,208
Who's in charge of
the deposition schedule?

498
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,036
-I am.
-Where do we stand with that?

499
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:25,406
I guess it's on hold.
We didn't know what to do.

500
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,639
Nothing is on hold.
Keep doing what you were.

501
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,079
Other side wants to talk,
they can call New York.

502
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:33,311
-I need his briefcase.
-Arthur's? I don't-- I didn't see it.

503
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,582
-He said it was in the room.
-It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.

504
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,550
Find it.

505
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:48,832
So all these people, they all start
having these dreams, okay?

506
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:53,406
You know what a vision quest is?
You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?

507
00:34:53,574 --> 00:34:56,839
<i>Yeah. I think so. Like a....</i>

508
00:34:57,211 --> 00:34:59,076
<i>Like a special dream.</i>

509
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:03,809
Except this is like a whole bunch of people
having the same dream.

510
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:07,386
They're all having this dream
that they should go to this one place.

511
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:09,580
They don't know why or anything.

512
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:12,885
They just have this feeling
that they have to go there.

513
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,925
<i>That they've been summoned.</i>

514
00:35:15,096 --> 00:35:16,324
That's the chapter.

515
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:19,466
Seriously, that's what it's called:
"Summons to Conquest."

516
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:20,931
<i>That's the title.</i>

517
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:26,768
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know
they're all having the same dream?

518
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:28,909
<i>No. That's what's so cool.</i>

519
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:31,377
They all think it's just them.

520
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:35,607
That maybe they're, like, going crazy
or something, so they don't wanna admit it.

521
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:37,910
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?

522
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:41,577
<i>No. It's real. It's really happening.</i>

523
00:35:41,756 --> 00:35:45,385
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?

524
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:51,258
Something larger than themselves
and they're not ready, are they...

525
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:53,229
...to hear it?

526
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,301
Yeah. But later they will.

527
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:58,302
So if you're gonna read it,
I don't wanna spoil it.

528
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,738
What are you doing?
Who you talking to?

529
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,877
<i>I called my dad. It's a friend of his.</i>

530
00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:07,310
<i>-Who?</i>
<i>-Mr. Edens. You don't know him.</i>

531
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:10,143
-Hello? Hello?
<i>-Henry, it's after 1 1.</i>

532
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:12,115
<i>I gotta get off now.</i>

533
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:16,279
No. Wait, wait. The book.
I need the book. The title.

534
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:19,121
The book is <i>Realm and Conquest.</i>

535
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:21,056
Realm and Conquest.

536
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:24,289
-It's Book One, with the red cover.
-Henry, give me the phone.

537
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:27,025
I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?

538
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:32,305
Yeah. Yeah. Thank-- Thank-- Thank--
Thank you, Henry, thank you.

539
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,946
<i>Realm and Conquest.</i> Thank you.

540
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,195
Karen? Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.

541
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:06,840
-You're late.
-I know.

542
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:09,533
I'm sorry, it was more complicated
than we thought.

543
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,405
Where is he?
We've been here since 5:30.

544
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,740
-He's asleep.
-Well, wake him up.

545
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:16,179
That's not gonna happen.
We just got him sedated.

546
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:19,710
Once he gets back
on his regular medication...

547
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:21,821
...then it's just a matter of time.

548
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,753
-Have you seen the video? The tape?
-I heard about it.

549
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:27,494
What happened after is worse.

550
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,564
This is in the parking lot, okay?
People running for their cars.

551
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:33,859
He's there in his socks, nothing else.

552
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:37,698
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will not sit with this sickness any longer.

553
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:40,670
I cannot aid this sickness any longer."

554
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,433
What does this mean?

555
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,401
I'm not sure.

556
00:37:44,578 --> 00:37:47,206
You've been with him the whole evening.
What's he saying?

557
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:49,178
He wasn't really making much sense.

558
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,908
This is totally unacceptable.

559
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:54,020
This is a 3-billion-dollar
class-action lawsuit.

560
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,122
In the morning, I have to call my board.

561
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:00,852
I have to tell them that the architect
of our entire defense has been arrested...

562
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:05,192
...for running naked in a snowstorm,
chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.

563
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,163
I understand.

564
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:10,260
What sickness is he talking about?

565
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:13,066
-I don't know. It could be anything.
-Well, give me one.

566
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,537
Frostbite.

567
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,669
You think this is funny?

568
00:38:16,844 --> 00:38:19,108
Look, his wife was sick
and she died last year.

569
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,740
His daughter doesn't talk to him.
He's all alone. All he does is your case.

570
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:26,614
He skipped his pills.
He had a bad day. That's it.

571
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:29,483
And you're somehow
the authority on this?

572
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:32,716
His last episode was eight years ago.
I was there.

573
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,726
I helped bring him home.
I watched him get better. That's it.

574
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,662
Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy
because of his low-key regularity...

575
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:42,826
...you hired him because he's a killer,
because he's brilliant...

576
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:45,666
...because he's crazy enough
to grind away on this case...

577
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,604
-...for six years without a break.
-We pay for his time.

578
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:50,801
I thought you wanted an explanation.

579
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:53,708
In the morning, I'm calling Marty Bach.

580
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:56,907
But, then, you know that.
Thank you, Michael.

581
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,883
He was mostly just quiet.

582
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:07,926
I heard him moving around,
I gave him a pill 1 5 minutes ago.

583
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,586
-He took it?
-A deal's a deal, right?

584
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,494
A super job, Elston.

585
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:16,329
You get to New York, you need tickets
to the game or anything, you let me know.

586
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:17,937
I'll do that for sure.

587
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:39,952
Did you see her?

588
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,455
-Who?
-Anna.

589
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:44,396
No.

590
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,126
No, I didn't see her.
She probably went back to the farm.

591
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:51,665
Well, we need her.

592
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:58,308
Marty, even then, and the rest of them,
they won't understand.

593
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,907
Well, if anybody can explain it to them,
it's you, Arthur.

594
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:06,813
No, they're lost.

595
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:10,047
-They have what they want.
-Let it go, man.

596
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:12,055
This what you wanted?

597
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,151
To be a janitor?

598
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:18,689
Live like this? All this?

599
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,161
Do what you do?

600
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:23,969
It can't be.

601
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:25,863
It's....

602
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,669
It's a burden,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

603
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:32,438
That's-- That's how it feels.

604
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:38,079
Well, I know that
we've been summoned.

605
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,685
Get some sleep.

606
00:40:57,571 --> 00:40:58,595
<i>Hello?</i>

607
00:40:58,772 --> 00:41:02,572
Yes. Hi, I'm looking for Verne?

608
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:04,942
<i>You have a number?</i>

609
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:08,206
Don Jeffries gave me the number.
He said I could call at any time.

610
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,247
<i>No. The account number.</i>

611
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:14,615
The code? I do.
I have it right here. One moment.

612
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,548
Excuse me one moment.

613
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:22,621
It's right here. 1 2-BKR-6.

614
00:41:22,796 --> 00:41:24,855
1 2-BKR-6.

615
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,291
Am I speaking with Verne?

616
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,700
<i>It's Mr. Verne.</i>

617
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:34,204
Mr. Verne. I'm sorry, it's so late.

618
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:36,366
Don said that I could....

619
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,308
I'm not exactly sure how this works.

620
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:42,472
<i>Do you have e-mail</i>
<i>at your current location?</i>

621
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,878
I do.

622
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:46,212
<i>-Are you alone?</i>
-I am.

623
00:41:46,987 --> 00:41:51,219
<i>Okay, I'm gonna upload you</i>
<i>a little encryption package we like to use.</i>

624
00:41:51,392 --> 00:41:52,791
<i>It's pretty self-explanatory.</i>

625
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,257
-Okay.
<i>-Okay.</i>

626
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:57,397
<i>But you have to give me a minute</i>
<i>to get to my desk. Hold on.</i>

627
00:41:57,565 --> 00:41:59,260
Okay. Thank you.

628
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:26,186
<i>What I was wondering is...</i>

629
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,193
...I have an option on the lease
for six more years.

630
00:42:29,363 --> 00:42:32,025
I was wondering if there's any way
I could lay that off.

631
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:35,191
Is the lease worth anything?

632
00:42:38,672 --> 00:42:41,163
Eighty-nine hundred a month. It's--

633
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:44,339
The fixtures are gone, but there's--

634
00:42:46,046 --> 00:42:49,243
But there's the bar, there's a kitchen,
it's a great space.

635
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,376
But there's a--

636
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,784
Yeah, I understand. No, I understand.

637
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:03,655
Okay, yeah, I will.

638
00:43:04,298 --> 00:43:05,822
All right. Thanks.

639
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,768
Come on, Arthur.

640
00:43:20,381 --> 00:43:21,678
Arthur!

641
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,242
Arthur, open the door.

642
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:29,686
Arthur, open the door!

643
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,926
Arthur, open the goddamn door!

644
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,492
Arthur, op--!

645
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:40,392
Open the fucking door!

646
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:48,241
Arthur!

647
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,671
Goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking--!

648
00:44:02,122 --> 00:44:03,316
Arthur?!

649
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:16,466
-Mr. Verne, hey.
-Hey, Danny.

650
00:44:16,637 --> 00:44:18,901
You guys are early.
I was pulling the other bags.

651
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,940
You can put them back.
There's been a change of plans, sorry.

652
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:24,009
-We ready?
-Yep.

653
00:44:28,148 --> 00:44:30,207
For chrissake.

654
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:32,249
Don Jeffries signed this?

655
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,280
That's really his signature?

656
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:37,424
Where's the original?

657
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:42,654
We had a warehouse fire five years ago.
We lost a number of documents.

658
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,636
What the hell is this doing
in Arthur's bag?

659
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,796
Well, I don't know, Marty.

660
00:44:53,974 --> 00:44:57,933
That's something I was hoping
you might be able to tell me.

661
00:45:02,683 --> 00:45:04,275
What are we looking for?

662
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:08,649
If it says U/North, pull it aside.
Anything that says U/North.

663
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,614
What a mess this is.

664
00:45:16,263 --> 00:45:17,491
I want all this...

665
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:22,528
...everything here, I want it all packed up
and sent up to the house.

666
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,036
Any luck, Michael?

667
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:29,869
He booked a limo from Newark Airport at 3,
got out at West Fourth Street...

668
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:32,011
...tipped the driver 1 00 bucks
and walked away.

669
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:33,373
Did you try his apartment?

670
00:45:33,547 --> 00:45:34,707
-He moved.
-I know.

671
00:45:34,882 --> 00:45:37,248
It's a loft. No doorman.
I rang, nobody answered.

672
00:45:37,418 --> 00:45:40,080
-I called, I got the machine.
-So he could be anywhere.

673
00:45:40,254 --> 00:45:43,246
Arthur downtown is not a good idea.
Some goddamn loft.

674
00:45:43,424 --> 00:45:46,154
-Where's his daughter?
-I don't know. Spain, lndia.

675
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:49,454
Mars. She's crazier than he'll ever be.

676
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,461
Barry's taking over on U/North.

677
00:45:51,632 --> 00:45:53,429
We got a lot of groveling to do.

678
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,693
You didn't exactly charm Karen Crowder.

679
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:57,097
I was punting.

680
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:59,933
You gotta saddle up here
and get things under control.

681
00:46:00,107 --> 00:46:01,096
Saddle up?

682
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:04,335
He needs to be under a doctor's care.
He needs to be admitted.

683
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,843
-Where?
-Does that really matter?

684
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,915
Michael, U/North needs to know
he's under control.

685
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:13,450
He's in a facility. They've been shook up.
They need to be reassured.

686
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,815
-It's not gonna be that easy.
-Why the hell not?

687
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:19,789
Because the laws in New York are
pretty tough on involuntary commitment.

688
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,518
Did you see this fucking tape?

689
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,391
I'm not arguing with you, Barry.
I'm telling you how it is.

690
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:27,693
You know what, guys?
We got 600 lawyers in this place.

691
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,360
Why don't we find out which one knows
about psychiatric-commitment statutes?

692
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,200
I can tell you that right now. It's Arthur.

693
00:46:45,853 --> 00:46:47,878
<i>I'm at the door. We're good to go.</i>

694
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,719
Yeah, roger that.
Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?

695
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,054
Every five minutes, copy that.

696
00:47:31,164 --> 00:47:33,257
<i>Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.</i>

697
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:36,698
<i>If you wish to leave a message,</i>
<i>please do so after the tone.</i>

698
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:40,102
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone.</i>

699
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:44,677
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone</i>
<i>and talk to me.</i>

700
00:47:46,513 --> 00:47:49,482
<i>No? Not gonna do it?</i>

701
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,378
What happened yesterday morning,
forget it. It doesn't matter.

702
00:47:53,554 --> 00:47:55,613
Someday you and I
are gonna laugh about it.

703
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,256
But you gotta call me back.

704
00:47:57,424 --> 00:47:59,824
You gotta call me back soon, Arthur.

705
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,094
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

706
00:48:02,262 --> 00:48:05,254
<i>Because you said it yourself.</i>
<i>Part of this is definitely madness.</i>

707
00:48:05,432 --> 00:48:07,798
<i>And there's a chemical part.</i>
<i>We both know it.</i>

708
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:10,193
<i>But if you're willing to start with that...</i>

709
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:13,498
<i>...then I'm more than willing to</i>
<i>meet you halfway and say, yes...</i>

710
00:48:13,674 --> 00:48:17,132
...this situation sucks.
This case sucks. U/North sucks.

711
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,905
We can start with that.
All right, Arthur? You hear me?

712
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,741
You're right about what we are.

713
00:48:22,449 --> 00:48:25,885
<i>I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying</i>
<i>that your behavior is out of control.</i>

714
00:48:26,053 --> 00:48:27,645
<i>But I'm telling you you're right.</i>

715
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:31,279
You called it. We're janitors, I get it.

716
00:48:33,226 --> 00:48:35,160
But we came to this, Arthur.

717
00:48:36,096 --> 00:48:39,156
<i>We made decisions.</i>
<i>It didn't happen overnight.</i>

718
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:43,429
You can't just suddenly stop and say,
"That's it, game over. I'm into miracles."

719
00:48:44,371 --> 00:48:46,168
<i>Arthur. Come on.</i>

720
00:48:47,808 --> 00:48:49,935
Goddamn it,
pick up the phone and talk to me.

721
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,442
Because whatever else
you think is so important...

722
00:48:52,613 --> 00:48:55,343
...you better let me help you,
because I'm telling you...

723
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:59,713
...janitor to janitor, I don't see
anybody else with a broom on the horizon.

724
00:48:59,886 --> 00:49:02,320
It's me, buddy. I'm the--

725
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:06,482
<i>Mailbox is full.</i>
<i>Your message cannot be recorded.</i>

726
00:50:06,987 --> 00:50:09,455
-Hello?
<i>-Hello. Is Anna there?</i>

727
00:50:09,623 --> 00:50:10,988
Hang on.

728
00:50:14,394 --> 00:50:15,918
<i>Anna!</i>

729
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,024
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

730
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:24,331
<i>-Anna!</i>
<i>-Anna!</i>

731
00:50:25,305 --> 00:50:27,603
<i>Anna, you've got a phone call!</i>

732
00:50:30,243 --> 00:50:32,336
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

733
00:50:43,724 --> 00:50:44,816
Hello?

734
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,419
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.

735
00:50:47,594 --> 00:50:50,154
<i>-Hey.</i>
-Did you get some sleep?

736
00:50:50,597 --> 00:50:52,155
<i>I guess.</i>

737
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:54,300
<i>Did you think about what we said?</i>

738
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,096
-Yeah.
<i>-You didn't tell anybody, did you?</i>

739
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:01,798
No. My sister's spying on me,
but that's normal.

740
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,671
Yeah. Because I meant what I said.

741
00:51:04,845 --> 00:51:07,245
<i>I know. I know. It's just...</i>

742
00:51:08,381 --> 00:51:12,181
...there's, like, 450 people in this lawsuit.

743
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:15,146
Why are you choosing me?

744
00:51:16,456 --> 00:51:18,822
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?

745
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,550
<i>That's for sure.</i>

746
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:22,695
I mean, does it--?
Does it really matter?

747
00:51:22,863 --> 00:51:27,027
<i>I mean, isn't it what we wait for?</i>
<i>To meet someone? And they're--</i>

748
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,497
<i>They're like a lens...</i>

749
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:32,331
...and suddenly you're looking
through them and everything changes...

750
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,497
...and nothing can ever be
the same again.

751
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,335
<i>Who you talking to?</i>

752
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,240
It's for me, okay? I get calls too.

753
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:40,845
That guy?

754
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:44,506
Same guy. Same guy.

755
00:51:45,152 --> 00:51:46,517
Sorry.

756
00:51:47,554 --> 00:51:51,854
No. That's-- That's okay.
My mother used to listen to my calls.

757
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,721
<i>She can't believe I can do anything</i>
<i>on my own.</i>

758
00:51:54,895 --> 00:51:56,362
Well, that'll change.

759
00:51:57,097 --> 00:51:58,394
<i>I guess.</i>

760
00:51:58,565 --> 00:52:01,591
<i>Yeah, but, see,</i>
<i>that's something we can show her.</i>

761
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:04,896
<i>That you can do something.</i>

762
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:08,199
<i>That we could-- We could do that together</i>
<i>if you want. I mean....</i>

763
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,639
<i>I mean that I can help you do that.</i>

764
00:52:11,578 --> 00:52:14,206
I can get you 1 2 by Monday.

765
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,440
Twelve's weak. Twelve looks bad.

766
00:52:16,616 --> 00:52:18,083
How do you figure that?

767
00:52:18,251 --> 00:52:21,812
They look at 75 and they look at you
and they wonder what the problem is.

768
00:52:21,988 --> 00:52:24,081
You say 1 2.
That's gonna make people nervous.

769
00:52:24,257 --> 00:52:27,192
This was the day before yesterday.
Let me get my ducks in order.

770
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,588
What's the car worth?

771
00:52:28,762 --> 00:52:30,957
It's a lease. It's the firm's.

772
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:35,033
So? You go to the bank.
You've got the apartment. You refinance.

773
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:37,830
I can't. I did that three months ago.

774
00:52:38,772 --> 00:52:40,467
Are you back at the tables?

775
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,575
Like I need that kind of action.
I don't have enough going on.

776
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,771
I hope you're kidding.

777
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:53,010
If he finds out you're playing cards with
his money, there's no dialogue after that.

778
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:56,612
Do everyone a favor.

779
00:52:56,823 --> 00:53:01,226
Get out the treasure map
and start digging.

780
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:03,485
You got a week.

781
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:07,629
-Hey, Michael. How are you?
-Hi, Cindy. I'm good.

782
00:53:07,801 --> 00:53:11,100
Come in. He's been on the phone
all morning. What else is new?

783
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,296
I am trying to get him out
in 1 5 minutes.

784
00:53:13,473 --> 00:53:15,907
-Is he upstairs?
-He's taken over the living room.

785
00:53:16,076 --> 00:53:17,976
What are you guys doing?
Get down here.

786
00:53:18,144 --> 00:53:22,911
Soroyo, I told you to keep an eye on
these kids, make sure they're downstairs.

787
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:38,920
Marty?

788
00:53:41,167 --> 00:53:44,034
You know what he's doing?
He's making their case.

789
00:53:44,704 --> 00:53:47,571
I'm going through his files here,
I'm reading this...

790
00:53:47,741 --> 00:53:49,606
...he's building a case against U/North.

791
00:53:49,776 --> 00:53:51,767
-Nobody's gonna let him do that.
-Let him?

792
00:53:51,945 --> 00:53:53,344
Who the hell's gonna stop him?

793
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,542
You know what I just heard?
He's calling these plaintiffs.

794
00:53:56,716 --> 00:54:00,914
This woman from the deposition,
he's calling these people now.

795
00:54:01,087 --> 00:54:04,022
He's got these discovery documents.
This is a fucking nightmare.

796
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:07,751
I tried him. Can't even leave a message.
He's got the machine jammed up.

797
00:54:07,928 --> 00:54:10,453
-Is that his briefcase?
-Yeah.

798
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:12,828
-Why?
-We've been looking for it.

799
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:16,526
I don't know. It came up here
with all the other stuff from his office.

800
00:54:16,703 --> 00:54:20,434
You can't believe
the crap he's got in here.

801
00:54:21,474 --> 00:54:22,498
Listen, Marty...

802
00:54:24,477 --> 00:54:26,809
...I'm in a bind here.

803
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:30,711
I need a loan. I need 80 grand.

804
00:54:31,885 --> 00:54:34,217
-I thought you were done with that.
-It's not that.

805
00:54:34,387 --> 00:54:37,220
It's not the cards. It's none of that.
It's the restaurant.

806
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:38,982
Eighty thousand.

807
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:40,626
I'm sorry to jump you like this.

808
00:54:40,794 --> 00:54:43,558
I've been trying to get a meeting
with you for two weeks.

809
00:54:44,331 --> 00:54:47,630
And I know about the merger,
whether I'm supposed to or not.

810
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,729
There's nothing final on the merger.

811
00:54:49,903 --> 00:54:52,838
Well, that's why I'm asking you now.
You're my meal ticket.

812
00:54:53,006 --> 00:54:55,668
Once you're out,
it's me and Barry with strangers...

813
00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:57,742
...and I'm trying to explain what I do.

814
00:54:57,911 --> 00:55:00,971
Everybody knows how valuable you are.
Everybody who needs to know.

815
00:55:01,147 --> 00:55:02,808
I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.

816
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:05,679
I've been riding shotgun for 1 2 years
and I got no equity.

817
00:55:05,852 --> 00:55:07,444
I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.

818
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,645
Nobody told you to
go into the bar business.

819
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,383
I only opened it so I'd have
something else, a way out.

820
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,220
I had no idea you were so unhappy.

821
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:17,420
How many times did I ask you
to put me back on a litigation team?

822
00:55:17,597 --> 00:55:19,258
-How many?
-Anybody can go to court.

823
00:55:19,432 --> 00:55:20,660
You think that's special?

824
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:23,496
-I was good at it.
-Wonderful. So are a lot of people.

825
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:27,337
At this, what you do, you're great.

826
00:55:27,507 --> 00:55:31,773
For chrissakes, you got something
everybody wants. You have a niche.

827
00:55:31,945 --> 00:55:34,937
You made a place.
You made a niche for yourself.

828
00:55:35,115 --> 00:55:39,176
And if it's nostalgia-- "You should've seen
me when I was a DA back in Queens."

829
00:55:39,352 --> 00:55:42,753
--let me give you a serious piece of advice:
Leave it there.

830
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:46,915
God forbid you're not as good as
you remember. I've seen that happen too.

831
00:55:47,794 --> 00:55:50,319
But I didn't come here for advice, did I?

832
00:55:50,897 --> 00:55:54,196
So this is what? I give you the loan
or you don't help out with Arthur?

833
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,959
-I never said that.
-No?

834
00:55:56,136 --> 00:55:57,467
Maybe you should have.

835
00:55:57,637 --> 00:56:02,301
I don't know how you're gonna take care
of this, but this, this is cancer.

836
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:05,638
This is something, we don't get it
reined in and cleaned up soon...

837
00:56:05,812 --> 00:56:07,939
...everything's vulnerable. Everything.

838
00:56:08,748 --> 00:56:12,081
-What are you telling me?
-That I'm counting on you.

839
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:16,411
I'm telling you that by this time next week,
Arthur will be under control...

840
00:56:16,589 --> 00:56:20,150
...and everybody who needs to will have
been reminded of your infinite value.

841
00:56:20,326 --> 00:56:21,623
Jesus, Marty.

842
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:23,294
Hey.

843
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,488
When did you get so fucking delicate?

844
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:28,157
I'm late.

845
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:10,867
Why don't you just call Uncle Gene
and get the cops to help you?

846
00:57:11,044 --> 00:57:13,069
It's not that kind of a problem.

847
00:57:14,714 --> 00:57:17,114
-How much longer are we doing this?
-I don't know.

848
00:57:29,129 --> 00:57:32,929
If he comes back to get his car,
you call that number and let me know.

849
00:57:33,099 --> 00:57:36,227
-Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
-Okay. You're welcome.

850
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:46,602
If we're not gonna get to the movie,
why don't you just say so?

851
00:57:46,779 --> 00:57:49,543
-What?
-I wanna go home.

852
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,513
Come on, Henry.

853
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:55,910
Hold up!

854
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:00,823
Stay in the car. Lock the door.

855
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:05,431
Arthur! Arthur!

856
00:58:05,598 --> 00:58:06,929
Wait up.

857
00:58:07,767 --> 00:58:11,168
Michael. Jeez. You scared me.

858
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,302
-Making a delivery?
-No, no, no.

859
00:58:16,142 --> 00:58:18,770
Very funny. No, nothing like that.

860
00:58:18,945 --> 00:58:22,540
Here, take one, please. Really.
It's-- It's still warm.

861
00:58:22,715 --> 00:58:24,342
It's the best bread I ever tasted.

862
00:58:28,388 --> 00:58:30,117
So welcome home.

863
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:34,226
I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.

864
00:58:34,394 --> 00:58:36,760
I was beginning to feel
a little overwhelmed.

865
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,761
-But you're feeling better now?
-Yeah.

866
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,423
-Much better, definitely.
-Not enough to call me back.

867
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,832
Well, I was trying
to gather my thoughts...

868
00:58:45,004 --> 00:58:48,599
...before I called you,
and that's what I was doing.

869
00:58:49,242 --> 00:58:50,641
And how's that going?

870
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:53,278
Yes, it's good, very good. I just....

871
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:58,984
Well, I just need to make my thoughts
a little bit more precise. That's....

872
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:00,449
That's my goal.

873
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,987
As good as this feels,
you know where it goes.

874
00:59:04,157 --> 00:59:05,556
No. No. You're wrong.

875
00:59:05,725 --> 00:59:08,819
What makes this feel good
is that I don't know where it goes.

876
00:59:09,996 --> 00:59:13,159
How do I talk to you, Arthur?
So you hear me?

877
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:17,861
Like a child? Like a nut?
Like everything's fine?

878
00:59:18,037 --> 00:59:21,803
What's the secret?
Because I need you to hear me.

879
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,739
-Well, I hear everything.
-Then hear this.

880
00:59:25,178 --> 00:59:29,137
You need help.
Before this goes too far, you need help.

881
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,543
You got great cards here.

882
00:59:30,717 --> 00:59:34,050
If you keep your clothes on, you can
do any goddamn thing you want.

883
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:37,451
You want out, you're out.
You wanna bake bread, go with God.

884
00:59:37,624 --> 00:59:40,320
There's only one wrong answer
in this whole goddamn pile...

885
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:42,256
...and you've got
your arms around it.

886
00:59:42,428 --> 00:59:45,727
-Well, I said I was sorry.
-You thought the hotel was overwhelming?

887
00:59:45,898 --> 00:59:48,458
You piss on this case,
they'll cut you off at the knees.

888
00:59:48,635 --> 00:59:51,900
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I'm covering for you.

889
00:59:52,071 --> 00:59:55,563
I'm telling them everything's fine.
You're fine. Everybody's cool.

890
00:59:55,742 --> 00:59:58,973
I'm out running this "price of genius" story
to anybody who'll listen.

891
00:59:59,145 --> 01:00:03,377
And then I wake up this morning and I hear
you're calling this girl from Wisconsin...

892
01:00:03,549 --> 01:00:05,414
...messing with documents
and whatever else.

893
01:00:05,585 --> 01:00:08,110
-How can you know that?
-They're gonna take everything.

894
01:00:08,288 --> 01:00:11,780
Your partnership, your equity.
They're gonna pull your license.

895
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:14,119
-How do you know I called Anna?
-Marty told me.

896
01:00:14,294 --> 01:00:18,060
-Well, how does he know?
-I don't know. I don't give a shit!

897
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:23,702
-You're tapping my phone.
-Jesus, Arthur.

898
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,735
Then explain it.
Tell me how Marty knows!

899
01:00:25,905 --> 01:00:30,774
Because you're chasing a girl through
a parking lot with your dick hanging out.

900
01:00:30,943 --> 01:00:33,776
You think she didn't get off the phone
and dial her attorney?

901
01:00:33,946 --> 01:00:35,811
No. She wouldn't do that. I know that.

902
01:00:35,982 --> 01:00:38,974
Really? You think your judgment
is state-of-the-art right now?

903
01:00:40,453 --> 01:00:44,753
They're putting everything on the table.
You need to stop and think this through.

904
01:00:44,924 --> 01:00:46,448
I'll help you think this through.

905
01:00:46,626 --> 01:00:48,856
I'll find somebody to help you
think it through.

906
01:00:49,529 --> 01:00:53,192
Don't do this.
You're making it easy for them.

907
01:00:54,867 --> 01:00:58,030
Michael, I have great affection for you.

908
01:00:58,204 --> 01:01:02,504
You lead a very rich and interesting life,
but you're a bagman, not an attorney.

909
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:04,940
If you wanted to have me committed...

910
01:01:05,111 --> 01:01:08,979
...you should have kept me in Wisconsin,
where the arrest report, the videotape...

911
01:01:09,148 --> 01:01:11,810
...and eyewitness accounts
of my inappropriate behavior...

912
01:01:11,984 --> 01:01:13,952
...would have had
jurisdictional relevance.

913
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,520
I have no criminal record
in the state of New York.

914
01:01:16,956 --> 01:01:22,223
And the single determining criterion
for involuntary incarceration is danger.

915
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:25,762
Is the defendant a danger
to himself or others?

916
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,628
You think you got the horses for that?

917
01:01:28,801 --> 01:01:31,531
Well, good luck and God bless.
But I tell you this:

918
01:01:32,805 --> 01:01:36,935
The last place you want to see me
is in court.

919
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,608
I'm not the enemy.

920
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,138
Then who are you?

921
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,694
<i>We find the seed.</i>

922
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,793

<i>We feed the planet.</i>

929

930

933

Yes!

934

Here we are, all together.
Is everyone listening?

01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:36,561

<i>Would you guys like</i>

Never let a scientist

...and "immediate"
in the same sentence.

950
01:04:27,513 --> 01:04:29,913
Well, this is a long way of saying that...

...you don't even have to leave your house

<i>to tell you what that means.</i>

973
01:05:42,755 --> 01:05:44,052
<i>Goodbye.</i>

974
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,285
-It seemed to warrant my coming to--
-Yes.

975
01:05:52,098 --> 01:05:53,725
You have to contain this.

976
01:05:55,468 --> 01:05:57,698
-Contain?
-Right.

977
01:05:58,237 --> 01:06:00,296
Well, that's my question.

978
01:06:01,073 --> 01:06:05,407
What are the...?
What's the option that we're looking at?

979
01:06:05,578 --> 01:06:07,409
Along those lines.

980
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:10,606
You're talking about the paper, the data?
I don't....

981
01:06:11,517 --> 01:06:15,954
Well, I'm wondering
if there is some other option.

982
01:06:16,122 --> 01:06:17,987
I mean something I'm not thinking of?

983
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:20,692
We deal in absolutes.

984
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:23,761
Okay. I understand that. I do.

985
01:06:23,929 --> 01:06:29,367
The material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer.
We try, we do what we can.

986
01:06:29,535 --> 01:06:31,366
Well, the other way?

987
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,271
Is the other way.

988
01:06:39,178 --> 01:06:41,669
-Maybe you wanna bring Don in on this.
-No.

989
01:06:41,847 --> 01:06:45,339
This is nothing to do with Don. He's busy.
This is nothing to do with Don.

990
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:54,088
Do you think it's doable?

991
01:06:55,561 --> 01:06:58,826
Yeah. We have some good ideas.
You say move, we move.

992
01:06:58,998 --> 01:07:02,092
If the ideas don't look so good,
we back off, reassess....

993
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:03,599
Okay.

994
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:11,132
Is that, "Okay, you understand,"
or "Okay, proceed"?

995
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,678
Are you 1 ? Are you 2? Are you 3?

996
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:20,978
Are you 4? Are you 5? Are you 6?

997
01:07:21,153 --> 01:07:23,348
-Are you 7? Are you 8? Are you 9?
-Come on.

998
01:07:23,522 --> 01:07:25,956
Come, come on. Come on, I said. Hey!

999
01:07:26,826 --> 01:07:28,691
Come on.

1000
01:07:28,861 --> 01:07:30,522
Go on, Dad, make a wish.

1001
01:07:30,696 --> 01:07:32,630
If I get what I wish for, it'll kill me.

1002
01:07:33,432 --> 01:07:36,094
You're a maniac. Unbelievable.

1003
01:07:36,268 --> 01:07:38,202
Give me a hand, Eddie, huh?

1004
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:42,504
All right, Eddie.

1005
01:07:42,675 --> 01:07:45,974
Now, I did not make this myself
and I don't wanna hear any complaints.

1006
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:47,578
Happy birthday.

1007
01:07:47,747 --> 01:07:49,510
You have time for cake?

1008
01:07:50,015 --> 01:07:52,279
Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.

1009
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:53,440
You going in?

1010
01:07:55,187 --> 01:07:57,348
-I'm late already.
-Shit.

1011
01:07:57,523 --> 01:07:58,922
You're not both running out?

1012
01:07:59,091 --> 01:08:00,854
I got a situation.

1013
01:08:01,026 --> 01:08:02,687
-You can't hang?
-You're going in.

1014
01:08:02,862 --> 01:08:05,228
-Yeah. I got a shift.
-So do I.

1015
01:08:05,397 --> 01:08:08,366
Come on, man.
You haven't been up here in months.

1016
01:08:08,534 --> 01:08:11,469
If you go back now, Mickey,
Henry's staying here.

1017
01:08:11,637 --> 01:08:14,003
Good. You can drive him home.

1018
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,606
Just stay for an hour.

1019
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:17,972
The girls did all this stuff.

1020
01:08:18,878 --> 01:08:20,277
He'll be asleep by then.

1021
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:26,243
Timmy's been calling me.

1022
01:08:30,222 --> 01:08:31,746
He's afraid to talk to you.

1023
01:08:31,924 --> 01:08:33,050
He should be.

1024
01:08:33,225 --> 01:08:35,819
-It closed out bad, right?
-Is that what he told you?

1025
01:08:35,995 --> 01:08:37,963
The kids are freaking out.

1026
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,695
The in-laws are freaking out.

1027
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:43,692
Pammy can't stop crying long enough
to start freaking out.

1028
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:47,532
-She took him back.
-So what? Fuck her and the kids?

1029
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:50,334
No. Fuck Timmy.
And nothing's closed, okay?

1030
01:08:50,509 --> 01:08:54,206
I sold everything and we're still short.
So don't talk about Pammy and the kids.

1031
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,438
I got my hands full.

1032
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:59,317
If it was you, he'd be in traction.

1033
01:09:00,586 --> 01:09:02,611
Yeah, he's sick, all right?

1034
01:09:03,789 --> 01:09:07,020
-He's sick. It's a sickness.
-There's a fresh perspective.

1035
01:09:07,193 --> 01:09:11,459
I've seen a lot of people falling off
the wagon lately. It's going around.

1036
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:14,226
Is that pointed at me?

1037
01:09:16,535 --> 01:09:19,265
When do I see you?
How do I know what you're up to?

1038
01:09:19,438 --> 01:09:21,804
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.

1039
01:09:21,974 --> 01:09:24,465
I haven't been in a card room
in 1 0 months.

1040
01:09:24,643 --> 01:09:27,703
I gambled on the bar.
I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.

1041
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,438
That was my big play, all right?

1042
01:09:29,615 --> 01:09:33,449
I put up my walk-away money
and it's gone and I'm scrambling.

1043
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:36,213
Okay. Okay.

1044
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,224
Cool down. I hear you.

1045
01:09:44,129 --> 01:09:46,188
I'd be pissed off too.

1046
01:09:52,471 --> 01:09:54,098
Just hang for an hour.

1047
01:09:55,007 --> 01:09:57,066
-Okay?
-Yeah.

1048
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:33,775
Ready? And, lift.

1049
01:10:33,944 --> 01:10:36,276
Ready and go.

1050
01:11:00,237 --> 01:11:01,295
Wipe.

1051
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,380
You better hit it.

1052
01:11:45,949 --> 01:11:47,314
We're good.

1053
01:12:21,651 --> 01:12:24,779
Okay, I found it. That's his number.

1054
01:12:24,955 --> 01:12:26,980
Dr. Mullien.
See if you have any more luck.

1055
01:12:27,157 --> 01:12:29,091
If I can. As soon as I get a chance.

1056
01:12:29,259 --> 01:12:32,353
It's Medicaid. They're running us in circles.
I can pull the file--

1057
01:12:32,529 --> 01:12:34,394
Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.

1058
01:12:34,564 --> 01:12:36,828
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.

1059
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,594
-Take a night off, Mickey.
-You look tired.

1060
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:41,761
-I'm okay. See you soon.
-Be good.

1061
01:12:41,938 --> 01:12:44,168
-All right. Bye.
-Bye, Hen.

1062
01:12:44,341 --> 01:12:46,036
-Bye, Pop.
-Bye.

1063
01:12:56,086 --> 01:12:58,452
-Uncle Timmy, hey!
-How you doing, Henry?

1064
01:12:58,622 --> 01:12:59,953
Henry, get in the car.

1065
01:13:02,626 --> 01:13:04,059
Good to see you, Hen.

1066
01:13:05,962 --> 01:13:08,726
-What do you want?
-I've been sober eight days now.

1067
01:13:09,733 --> 01:13:13,396
Been back at the meetings.
I wanted you to know.

1068
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:15,197
In front of the kid?

1069
01:13:15,372 --> 01:13:18,864
Mickey, please.
I know how bad I did, I swear.

1070
01:13:19,876 --> 01:13:23,471
I don't know how to make it right again.
It's all I think about.

1071
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:26,278
What do I do? I don't know what to do.

1072
01:13:27,384 --> 01:13:29,909
Get Stephanie her tires back.

1073
01:13:35,192 --> 01:13:38,161
-Is he crying?
-I don't know.

1074
01:13:38,328 --> 01:13:40,159
Because of drugs, right?

1075
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:42,127
That and everything else.

1076
01:14:13,497 --> 01:14:14,964
What?

1077
01:14:17,234 --> 01:14:18,599
Your Uncle Timmy...

1078
01:14:19,269 --> 01:14:24,764
...and I mean this, on his best day,
is never as tough as you.

1079
01:14:25,809 --> 01:14:28,972
I'm not talking about crying
or the drugs or anything.

1080
01:14:29,145 --> 01:14:32,239
I'm talking about in his heart, in his heart.
You understand me?

1081
01:14:33,316 --> 01:14:37,184
And all his charming bullshit,
this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss bullshit...

1082
01:14:37,354 --> 01:14:39,549
...and I know you love him,
and I know why.

1083
01:14:39,723 --> 01:14:41,520
But when you see him like that...

1084
01:14:41,691 --> 01:14:44,455
...you don't have to worry.
That's not how it'll be for you.

1085
01:14:44,628 --> 01:14:47,188
You're not gonna be someone
that goes through life...

1086
01:14:47,364 --> 01:14:50,959
...wondering why shit keeps
falling out of the sky around them.

1087
01:14:51,134 --> 01:14:53,534
I know that. I know it.

1088
01:14:53,703 --> 01:14:55,000
Okay?

1089
01:14:59,242 --> 01:15:03,406
I see it every time I look at you.
I see it right now.

1090
01:15:05,715 --> 01:15:08,445
I don't know where you got it from,
but you got it.

1091
01:15:10,153 --> 01:15:11,484
Okay?

1092
01:15:24,701 --> 01:15:25,998
Hello?

1093
01:15:36,012 --> 01:15:39,914
The neighbors came by.
They're renovating the loft downstairs.

1094
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:44,713
They had water flooding from
his bathroom down to their place.

1095
01:15:45,055 --> 01:15:50,357
His front door, fire escape,
he had everything locked up pretty good.

1096
01:15:50,527 --> 01:15:54,861
It took our guys 1 0 minutes.
They had to knock the thing down.

1097
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:58,800
There's pills all over the place.

1098
01:15:59,603 --> 01:16:04,666
Just the scene alone is
pretty definitive for suicide.

1099
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:07,775
Then I spoke to some of your partners...

1100
01:16:07,944 --> 01:16:11,539
...who ran down these problems
he'd been having lately, so....

1101
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:17,046
-Is there a note?
-No. They looked.

1102
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:22,183
It could be an accident or he was gonna
write a note and just messed up.

1103
01:16:23,259 --> 01:16:24,556
Can I get in there?

1104
01:16:24,728 --> 01:16:27,754
His place? Not now. It's sealed.

1105
01:16:28,465 --> 01:16:32,629
Once the seal goes up, it's frozen.
We're gonna try and reach his daughter.

1106
01:16:32,802 --> 01:16:35,930
I guess she's off in Europe.
But she's gotta come in.

1107
01:16:36,573 --> 01:16:39,633
Or the M.E.'s gotta come back
with a toxicology report.

1108
01:16:39,809 --> 01:16:43,506
That's a couple of weeks at least
that it's gotta stay like that.

1109
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:45,312
Sorry.

1110
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:48,817
Sure.

1111
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:56,080
Okay.

1112
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:04,926
I know your brother a little.
My wife works the 1 90 out in Queens.

1113
01:17:06,569 --> 01:17:07,729
I'll tell him hello.

1114
01:17:07,904 --> 01:17:09,929
If something comes in,
I'll get back to you.

1115
01:17:10,807 --> 01:17:12,172
Yeah. I appreciate it.

1116
01:17:12,342 --> 01:17:14,139
I'm sorry for your loss.

1117
01:17:32,629 --> 01:17:35,223
-Michael.
-Jeff.

1118
01:17:35,398 --> 01:17:36,865
This is tough.

1119
01:17:37,033 --> 01:17:38,625
Yeah, it is. He in here?

1120
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:52,375
Dumb son of a bitch.

1121
01:17:52,882 --> 01:17:54,008
What a thing.

1122
01:17:54,184 --> 01:17:56,414
-Hold on.
-I don't even know--

1123
01:17:56,586 --> 01:17:58,486
-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah. All right.

1124
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:01,886
I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.

1125
01:18:02,058 --> 01:18:05,516
That crazy goddamn bastard.

1126
01:18:06,062 --> 01:18:09,054
What a waste.
What the hell was he thinking?

1127
01:18:09,733 --> 01:18:11,564
Marty? I gotta set this up.

1128
01:18:11,735 --> 01:18:13,259
Go. Go.

1129
01:18:14,003 --> 01:18:15,334
You okay?

1130
01:18:16,072 --> 01:18:17,835
Yeah, I'm fine.

1131
01:18:19,109 --> 01:18:21,168
Come on, let's get you a drink.

1132
01:18:24,013 --> 01:18:28,245
I just keep replaying all this back.
Like, did I push him too hard?

1133
01:18:28,418 --> 01:18:29,646
Not a chance.

1134
01:18:29,819 --> 01:18:31,616
I just couldn't get through to him.

1135
01:18:31,788 --> 01:18:34,951
What, you scared him to death?
Come on. The man was a bull.

1136
01:18:35,425 --> 01:18:39,054
-Never happened.
-Why does he fold, then? Why does he...?

1137
01:18:41,097 --> 01:18:42,962
It's gotta be an accident.

1138
01:18:43,133 --> 01:18:44,691
No, no. Arthur without a note?

1139
01:18:44,868 --> 01:18:47,837
He couldn't piss without leaving a memo.
Has to be an accident.

1140
01:18:48,004 --> 01:18:50,268
I don't get that.
I don't understand that either.

1141
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,670
One minute he's gonna
take on the whole world...

1142
01:18:52,842 --> 01:18:55,868
...and then 1 2 hours later,
he's sucking down pills. Why?

1143
01:18:56,045 --> 01:18:57,444
Why?

1144
01:18:58,882 --> 01:19:02,079
Because people are
fucking incomprehensible. "Why?"

1145
01:19:05,955 --> 01:19:09,413
Thirty years I know Arthur.

1146
01:19:09,893 --> 01:19:11,554
Good years.

1147
01:19:13,096 --> 01:19:17,260
And what I feel right now, if I'm honest?

1148
01:19:20,103 --> 01:19:22,594
I can't even say, it's so awful.

1149
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:25,401
You can say it.

1150
01:19:27,944 --> 01:19:29,844
We caught a lucky break.

1151
01:19:32,849 --> 01:19:35,147
We did, didn't we?

1152
01:19:39,856 --> 01:19:43,292
Marty? We need to get up to the office.

1153
01:19:43,459 --> 01:19:45,188
-They accepted?
-In principle.

1154
01:19:45,361 --> 01:19:48,194
Don Jeffries wants us
on the phone in half an hour.

1155
01:19:48,364 --> 01:19:51,265
I tried to explain about Arthur,
but they're short on sympathy.

1156
01:19:51,434 --> 01:19:53,334
Wait a minute. U/North is settling?

1157
01:19:53,503 --> 01:19:57,564
They see a window. They wanna try.
It's their show. What are we gonna do?

1158
01:19:59,309 --> 01:20:02,437
You did what you could, Michael.
We all did.

1159
01:20:03,847 --> 01:20:05,178
It's....

1160
01:20:05,348 --> 01:20:07,009
It's what we got.

1161
01:20:08,151 --> 01:20:10,984
-You need a ride?
-No, thanks, I'm fine.

1162
01:20:43,786 --> 01:20:44,775
Hello.

1163
01:20:44,954 --> 01:20:47,548
Hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.

1164
01:20:47,724 --> 01:20:48,816
<i>Who is this?</i>

1165
01:20:48,992 --> 01:20:52,484
Michael Clayton. I'm an attorney in
New York. I got your number from Arthur.

1166
01:20:52,662 --> 01:20:55,529
<i>-You have got some nerve.</i>
-Excuse me?

1167
01:20:55,698 --> 01:20:59,498
You get her all the way to New York City
and then leave her at the airport?

1168
01:20:59,903 --> 01:21:01,495
<i>This is not a complicated person.</i>

1169
01:21:01,671 --> 01:21:04,504
<i>This is a girl who's never been</i>
<i>farther than Milwaukee.</i>

1170
01:21:04,674 --> 01:21:06,665
-Wait a minute. Now, wait.
<i>-No, you wait.</i>

1171
01:21:06,843 --> 01:21:11,075
She's coming home tomorrow
and when she does, if you call here again--

1172
01:21:11,247 --> 01:21:13,545
Are you telling me she's
in New York right now?

1173
01:21:14,017 --> 01:21:16,008
<i>This is a young girl, do you hear me?</i>

1174
01:21:16,185 --> 01:21:18,619
She's in the city right now?

1175
01:21:18,788 --> 01:21:20,346
<i>What kind of people are you?</i>

1176
01:21:20,523 --> 01:21:23,549
Listen. You just stay on the phone
one second. One second.

1177
01:21:56,259 --> 01:21:57,487
<i>Anna.</i>

1178
01:21:59,896 --> 01:22:01,386
Anna?

1179
01:22:02,198 --> 01:22:05,167
My name's Michael Clayton.
I'm a friend of Arthur's.

1180
01:22:05,335 --> 01:22:07,997
I spoke with your sister.
She told me you were here.

1181
01:22:09,305 --> 01:22:11,170
Please open the door, Anna.

1182
01:22:22,485 --> 01:22:24,180
What are you thinking?

1183
01:22:24,988 --> 01:22:30,290
I don't know. I'll watch the door.
You check his car. Let's get some details.

1184
01:22:33,129 --> 01:22:36,394
He didn't want to say
exactly what it was.

1185
01:22:38,267 --> 01:22:42,101
Just that when I got here,
he would pick me up...

1186
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:44,637
...and show me, and I would see...

1187
01:22:45,608 --> 01:22:48,475
...that it was something
that would win the whole case.

1188
01:22:51,681 --> 01:22:53,546
Even this morning...

1189
01:22:53,716 --> 01:22:55,308
...I mean, I thought:

1190
01:22:56,853 --> 01:23:01,517
"Okay, if I get to the airport
and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.

1191
01:23:01,691 --> 01:23:06,788
Okay, you're stupid,
and you can go home now."

1192
01:23:09,399 --> 01:23:14,234
But it was there and he paid,
like, 800 dollars...

1193
01:23:14,404 --> 01:23:17,066
...for a first-class ticket.

1194
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,707
And I just....

1195
01:23:22,645 --> 01:23:24,579
I got on the plane.

1196
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:29,284
I believed him.

1197
01:23:34,057 --> 01:23:38,721
You think maybe he was
in some way disappointed?

1198
01:23:39,562 --> 01:23:43,555
Let's say that he knew that you
told somebody else about all of this...

1199
01:23:43,733 --> 01:23:47,169
...and, I don't know, in some crazy way,
he was disappointed by that?

1200
01:23:48,271 --> 01:23:51,172
-But I didn't.
-You must have told somebody else.

1201
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:52,898
No.

1202
01:23:54,077 --> 01:23:56,238
He made me promise.

1203
01:23:57,747 --> 01:24:02,116
You didn't tell anybody else about this?
Not one other person?

1204
01:24:03,252 --> 01:24:04,651
No.

1205
01:24:09,425 --> 01:24:12,360
He really was crazy, wasn't he?

1206
01:24:25,108 --> 01:24:27,975
-You talking about this?
-Let me see.

1207
01:24:29,479 --> 01:24:31,140
-You know what that is?
-Yeah.

1208
01:24:32,081 --> 01:24:35,141
You said a favor.
That's more than a favor.

1209
01:24:35,318 --> 01:24:37,479
Well, nobody's gonna know
where it came from.

1210
01:24:38,855 --> 01:24:41,289
-Are you that jammed up?
-What are you talking about?

1211
01:24:41,457 --> 01:24:44,085
Who asked for this?
It's the restaurant, right?

1212
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:46,751
One of these guys you owe?
"Get me a seal."

1213
01:24:46,929 --> 01:24:48,556
You really wanna know?

1214
01:26:05,875 --> 01:26:08,105
This just gets better and better.

1215
01:26:09,745 --> 01:26:11,337
What are we doing?

1216
01:28:13,002 --> 01:28:14,026
Freeze!

1217
01:28:14,203 --> 01:28:16,933
Right there, asshole! Don't move!

1218
01:28:17,106 --> 01:28:19,370
-It's all right, I'm a friend!
-Get your hands up!

1219
01:28:19,542 --> 01:28:22,067
Get your hands up now! Now!

1220
01:28:22,244 --> 01:28:24,178
-What's in your hand?
-It's a book.

1221
01:28:24,347 --> 01:28:27,214
Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!

1222
01:28:27,383 --> 01:28:30,682
-Turn around. Slowly.
-All right. All right. Okay.

1223
01:28:30,853 --> 01:28:32,684
-Who else is here?
-Nobody.

1224
01:28:32,855 --> 01:28:35,289
-I said, who else is here?
-Nobody's here!

1225
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:36,857
Check in there.

1226
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:40,959
You move, I'll take your head off.

1227
01:29:10,826 --> 01:29:15,263
Now I owe this scumbag and his wife--
Who's a complete piece of shit in my unit.

1228
01:29:15,431 --> 01:29:17,524
-Now I owe them both my balls.
-I'm sorry.

1229
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,691
-You know I am.
-"Nobody will know it's me."

1230
01:29:19,869 --> 01:29:22,929
You know what happens they don't
bury this, that I gave you this?

1231
01:29:23,105 --> 01:29:24,470
It's bad. I know it.

1232
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,700
I'm 1 8 months away from my 20.
You just put my pension in jeopardy.

1233
01:29:27,877 --> 01:29:29,845
-You made your point.
-It's not a point!

1234
01:29:30,012 --> 01:29:32,378
-Who called 91 1 ?
-What?

1235
01:29:32,681 --> 01:29:35,616
The building was empty. I was quiet.
I wasn't there very long.

1236
01:29:35,785 --> 01:29:38,219
Who called it in?
Does that make sense to you--?

1237
01:29:38,387 --> 01:29:39,945
This never happened.

1238
01:29:41,257 --> 01:29:43,282
You got these cops thinking
you're a lawyer.

1239
01:29:43,459 --> 01:29:45,518
You got these lawyers thinking
you're a cop.

1240
01:29:45,694 --> 01:29:49,824
You got everybody fooled, don't you?
Everybody but you.

1241
01:29:49,999 --> 01:29:52,092
You know exactly what you are.

1242
01:30:05,714 --> 01:30:07,238
We tried calling you six times.

1243
01:30:07,416 --> 01:30:09,543
But your machine must be
busted or something.

1244
01:30:11,387 --> 01:30:12,877
We gave it our best shot.

1245
01:30:14,223 --> 01:30:16,714
We ran out of red covers.
We only had 2000 in stock...

1246
01:30:16,892 --> 01:30:18,757
...so we did the other thousand in blue.

1247
01:30:40,182 --> 01:30:41,672
Is everything all right?

1248
01:30:41,851 --> 01:30:43,079
It's fine, yeah.

1249
01:30:43,786 --> 01:30:46,846
You have a van or something?
Because I have 25 boxes back there--

1250
01:30:47,022 --> 01:30:50,082
Do me a favor. Hang on to them.

1251
01:30:50,259 --> 01:30:52,489
I'll come back and pick everything up
next week.

1252
01:30:52,661 --> 01:30:54,720
-Seriously? Thanks, man.
-Yeah.

1253
01:31:15,284 --> 01:31:16,649
Hello.

1254
01:31:21,724 --> 01:31:25,023
Don. You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

1255
01:31:25,594 --> 01:31:26,891
What?

1256
01:31:34,303 --> 01:31:36,464
<i>Do you know Michael Clayton?</i>

1257
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:38,129
<i>Yeah, why?</i>

1258
01:31:38,307 --> 01:31:40,070
We have a situation.

1259
01:31:59,862 --> 01:32:01,420
Hey, did they find you?

1260
01:32:01,597 --> 01:32:04,623
-Who?
-Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.

1261
01:32:12,808 --> 01:32:14,139
Marty.

1262
01:32:14,476 --> 01:32:17,673
Your phone's off. There's too much
going on for your phone to be off.

1263
01:32:17,846 --> 01:32:19,837
-I need a minute.
-Yeah, well, we're late--

1264
01:32:20,015 --> 01:32:21,642
We never got to finish last night.

1265
01:32:21,817 --> 01:32:23,944
Did you close the place?
You look like hell.

1266
01:32:24,119 --> 01:32:27,179
-No, I left right after you left.
-If you say so.

1267
01:32:27,356 --> 01:32:30,052
We've been here all night.
We had to make an announcement.

1268
01:32:30,225 --> 01:32:33,490
Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.

1269
01:32:33,662 --> 01:32:36,859
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you.
I had to pull the trigger.

1270
01:32:37,032 --> 01:32:39,967
I put Bob Nast and Kim,
probably a mistake.

1271
01:32:40,135 --> 01:32:43,468
They're gonna pull together a memorial
service by the end of the week.

1272
01:32:43,639 --> 01:32:45,903
I told them to call you
if they need any help.

1273
01:32:46,408 --> 01:32:49,172
No, no, no.
The other one. The other one.

1274
01:32:49,745 --> 01:32:52,043
So we cut you a check this morning.

1275
01:32:52,214 --> 01:32:55,513
There's some strings attached.
And Barry....

1276
01:32:55,684 --> 01:32:59,814
There's no way around this,
Barry's gonna have to be involved.

1277
01:33:03,592 --> 01:33:06,026
What if Arthur was on to something?

1278
01:33:06,195 --> 01:33:07,856
What do you mean? On to what?

1279
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:10,897
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?
What if he was right?

1280
01:33:11,066 --> 01:33:13,227
Right about what?
That we're on the wrong side?

1281
01:33:13,402 --> 01:33:15,836
Wrong side, wrong way,
everything, all of it.

1282
01:33:16,005 --> 01:33:18,940
This is news?
This case reeked from day one.

1283
01:33:19,108 --> 01:33:21,099
I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?

1284
01:33:21,276 --> 01:33:24,006
What would they do?
What would they do if he went public?

1285
01:33:24,179 --> 01:33:27,580
What would they do? Are you fucking soft?
They're doing it.

1286
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:30,184
We don't straighten the settlement out
in 24 hours...

1287
01:33:30,352 --> 01:33:32,411
...they're gonna withhold
$9 million in fees.

1288
01:33:32,588 --> 01:33:35,557
Then they'll pull out the video of
Arthur doing his flashdance.

1289
01:33:35,724 --> 01:33:37,453
They'll sue us for legal malpractice.

1290
01:33:37,626 --> 01:33:41,289
Except there won't be anything to win
because the London merger will be dead...

1291
01:33:41,463 --> 01:33:44,125
...and we'll be selling off
the goddamn furniture.

1292
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,295
That's 80.

1293
01:33:46,802 --> 01:33:48,599
We're calling it a bonus.

1294
01:33:49,438 --> 01:33:51,463
Three-year contract
at your current numbers.

1295
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,267
That's assuming this all works out.

1296
01:33:53,442 --> 01:33:54,602
You're doing this now?

1297
01:33:56,278 --> 01:33:59,611
Look, I agreed to this, okay?
But there's rules now.

1298
01:33:59,782 --> 01:34:02,649
You want the contract,
you sign a confidentiality agreement.

1299
01:34:02,818 --> 01:34:04,911
It's gonna be bulletproof
and retroactive.

1300
01:34:05,087 --> 01:34:06,816
Because Marty's too nice to say it...

1301
01:34:06,989 --> 01:34:10,789
...but with all you know about this place,
the clients and people who work here...

1302
01:34:10,959 --> 01:34:13,519
...it makes it a little weird
when you ask for 80 grand.

1303
01:34:14,196 --> 01:34:16,892
If I was gonna shake anybody down,
I'd come to you...

1304
01:34:17,066 --> 01:34:19,728
...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand.
Is this him or you?

1305
01:34:19,902 --> 01:34:22,496
-If I'm wrong, I apologize.
-You're way the fuck wrong.

1306
01:34:22,671 --> 01:34:23,899
So there you go.

1307
01:34:24,073 --> 01:34:25,734
Enough. Okay? Everybody.

1308
01:34:26,608 --> 01:34:28,769
He's an asshole, but he knows it.

1309
01:34:29,178 --> 01:34:32,443
And you're on the record.
Okay? Everybody happy?

1310
01:34:33,082 --> 01:34:35,778
-Don Jeffries is here.
-We're on the way.

1311
01:34:36,585 --> 01:34:40,681
Call Bob Nast.
Just see if they need help with this thing.

1312
01:34:44,259 --> 01:34:45,624
You're welcome.

1313
01:35:38,514 --> 01:35:40,880
You said 1 2. This is 75.

1314
01:35:41,049 --> 01:35:43,210
Well, don't get too excited.
You want a drink?

1315
01:35:43,385 --> 01:35:45,250
No. I'm working.

1316
01:35:47,689 --> 01:35:51,216
So we're square, then. No bad blood.

1317
01:35:51,393 --> 01:35:53,088
You're just doing your job.

1318
01:35:53,262 --> 01:35:54,729
That's right.

1319
01:35:55,664 --> 01:35:57,393
Take it easy, Gabe.

1320
01:35:58,400 --> 01:35:59,765
Michael.

1321
01:36:11,513 --> 01:36:12,946
<i>Check.</i>

1322
01:36:14,783 --> 01:36:16,045
<i>Check.</i>

1323
01:36:16,385 --> 01:36:19,115
-Check.
-Half the pot. Two hundred.

1324
01:36:19,288 --> 01:36:20,585
Two hundred to go.

1325
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,723
So, what happened with the bar?

1326
01:36:59,895 --> 01:37:01,920
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

1327
01:37:24,419 --> 01:37:27,183
What are you doing? You just got here.

1328
01:37:27,356 --> 01:37:29,290
Guy plays nine hands, walks away.

1329
01:37:29,458 --> 01:37:33,622
I scare you away? What did I do?
Did I scare you away?

1330
01:38:09,398 --> 01:38:10,456
Get out.

1331
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:13,960
<i>Get out of the car now.</i>

1332
01:38:15,704 --> 01:38:16,693
-Walter?
<i>-Michael.</i>

1333
01:38:16,872 --> 01:38:19,067
<i>-Michael. Thank God you're there.</i>
-Yeah.

1334
01:38:23,478 --> 01:38:25,412
You have eight...

1335
01:38:26,315 --> 01:38:29,045
<i>...six, five...</i>

1336
01:38:29,217 --> 01:38:31,549
<i>...four, three....</i>

1337
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,347
<i>Get out of the car.</i>

1338
01:38:36,792 --> 01:38:39,818
-Tell him to stay off the phone.
<i>-All right. But you're on it?</i>

1339
01:38:40,429 --> 01:38:41,862
Am I clean?

1340
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:43,258
Just keep walking.

1341
01:38:43,432 --> 01:38:45,662
You copy. Am I clean?

1342
01:38:45,867 --> 01:38:48,859
Just keep moving.
He's walking to the car.

1343
01:38:49,404 --> 01:38:52,965
<i>--to let him know you're on the way.</i>
<i>I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

1344
01:38:53,141 --> 01:38:55,575
<i>-Just give me two minutes.</i>
-I'll be in the car.

1345
01:38:59,281 --> 01:39:02,717
<i>I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.</i>

1346
01:39:30,879 --> 01:39:34,440
It's loose. I got a pulse.
He's up there somewhere, but....

1347
01:39:36,218 --> 01:39:38,152
Let's find a way to boost the signal.

1348
01:39:45,727 --> 01:39:48,924
-I don't know what Walter promised you--
-A miracle worker!

1349
01:39:49,097 --> 01:39:52,328
That's Walter on the phone,
20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?

1350
01:39:52,501 --> 01:39:54,332
"I'm sending you a miracle worker."

1351
01:39:54,503 --> 01:39:56,164
-Well, he misspoke.
-About what?

1352
01:39:56,338 --> 01:39:59,865
About the fact that you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're any good at it?

1353
01:40:05,647 --> 01:40:07,581
We're up. Just got a signal.

1354
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,806
There's nothing back this way.
What's he doing?

1355
01:40:33,975 --> 01:40:35,169
Maybe he's lost.

1356
01:40:35,343 --> 01:40:37,140
-Wait a minute.
-That's him.

1357
01:40:40,482 --> 01:40:41,710
He was alone, right?

1358
01:40:41,883 --> 01:40:44,681
-Yeah, I think so.
-Call it, yes or no?

1359
01:40:47,122 --> 01:40:48,749
We gotta turn around.

1360
01:41:18,987 --> 01:41:20,614
Talk to me.

1361
01:41:20,789 --> 01:41:22,347
It's strobing.

1362
01:41:22,524 --> 01:41:24,924
No, we're good. I think we're good.
Just keep going.

1363
01:41:40,742 --> 01:41:42,334
No, he turned. Somehow he turned.

1364
01:41:42,511 --> 01:41:43,876
-Where?
-He took--

1365
01:41:44,379 --> 01:41:46,347
-He took a left.
-I don't have a left.

1366
01:41:56,324 --> 01:41:59,259
-East. He's southeast.
-What, so we missed it?

1367
01:41:59,427 --> 01:42:01,554
-Or the grid is wrong.
-Hang on.

1368
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:14,436
-We gotta go back to one.
-One is what? Where's our one?

1369
01:42:14,643 --> 01:42:17,635
Half a mile straight ahead.
Just keep driving. Just go.

1370
01:42:24,519 --> 01:42:27,147
It says we're closing.
But that's west. It can't be west.

1371
01:42:27,322 --> 01:42:28,380
The signal or the grid?

1372
01:42:28,557 --> 01:42:31,287
-It's both. It just keeps dropping out.
-Goddamn it.

1373
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:23,977
Give me the cell.

1374
01:43:26,514 --> 01:43:28,209
Our signal's good.

1375
01:45:06,114 --> 01:45:07,376
What?

1376
01:45:10,018 --> 01:45:11,713
Thanks, Mickey.

1377
01:45:11,886 --> 01:45:13,547
Just get me out of here.

1378
01:45:21,262 --> 01:45:24,993
I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this,
soon as we can. Thursday at the latest.

1379
01:45:25,166 --> 01:45:28,795
I think we should have someone from
the equity group there. Maybe McDonnell--

1380
01:45:28,970 --> 01:45:30,460
-Yeah?
-Did you hear?

1381
01:45:30,638 --> 01:45:33,163
-Yeah, yeah. They closed U/North.
-No. Michael Clayton.

1382
01:45:33,608 --> 01:45:34,666
What?

1383
01:45:34,843 --> 01:45:37,744
Car bomb. Upstate. This morning.
He was killed.

1384
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:39,804
What?

1385
01:45:41,483 --> 01:45:43,314
Holy shit.

1386
01:45:57,499 --> 01:46:02,436
<i>It has been and it remains</i>
<i>the U/North position...</i>

1387
01:46:02,604 --> 01:46:06,700
<i>...that this lawsuit is baseless</i>
<i>and without merit.</i>

1388
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:10,936
Our reluctance to negotiate
was anchored by this belief...

1389
01:46:11,112 --> 01:46:16,277
...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand
for settlement...

1390
01:46:16,451 --> 01:46:19,011
...in excess of 3 billion dollars.

1391
01:46:19,187 --> 01:46:22,645
The reason that we are
all here today is...

1392
01:46:22,824 --> 01:46:26,692
...that several key elements
in the case have changed.

1393
01:46:27,695 --> 01:46:32,132
<i>You all have</i>
<i>a tentative proposal packet...</i>

1394
01:46:32,734 --> 01:46:36,693
<i>...which outlines the details,</i>
<i>but the bottom line is this:</i>

1395
01:46:36,871 --> 01:46:39,635
<i>Over the past several months</i>
<i>we had gotten word...</i>

1396
01:46:39,808 --> 01:46:43,141
...that the plaintiffs were
growing impatient...

1397
01:46:43,311 --> 01:46:47,145
...and were in the process
of revising their settlement numbers.

1398
01:46:47,649 --> 01:46:49,116
<i>We also learned...</i>

1399
01:46:49,284 --> 01:46:53,220
<i>...that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees</i>
<i>were capped at 32 percent...</i>

1400
01:46:53,388 --> 01:46:55,481
<i>...up to 400 million dollars...</i>

1401
01:46:55,924 --> 01:47:00,156
...above which,
their fees dropped to 24 percent.

1402
01:47:00,328 --> 01:47:04,890
So we knew that there would be
this motivational dead zone for them...

1403
01:47:05,066 --> 01:47:06,397
...in the middle there.

1404
01:47:07,168 --> 01:47:08,863
<i>Finally...</i>

1405
01:47:09,037 --> 01:47:13,371
...our finance team informed us
that they had run the numbers...

1406
01:47:13,541 --> 01:47:15,372
...and that the tax benefit...

1407
01:47:15,543 --> 01:47:18,774
...provided that we bring
the settlement in under 600 million...

1408
01:47:18,947 --> 01:47:21,381
...and within this fiscal year...

1409
01:47:21,549 --> 01:47:27,419
...that the write-off on this settlement
would essentially pay for itself.

1410
01:47:27,922 --> 01:47:32,120
<i>The package that you have before you</i>
<i>represents, in my judgment...</i>

1411
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:37,361
<i>...the strongest possible position for</i>
<i>our company under the circumstances.</i>

1412
01:47:37,532 --> 01:47:39,227
<i>And, as chief counsel...</i>

1413
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:42,665
...it is my recommendation
that this proposal be confirmed.

1414
01:47:43,738 --> 01:47:47,265
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us
a few minutes to talk about it.

1415
01:47:47,442 --> 01:47:49,706
Certainly. I'll be right outside.

1416
01:47:52,113 --> 01:47:53,102
Well....

1417
01:48:16,237 --> 01:48:18,068
How'd it go in there?

1418
01:48:21,109 --> 01:48:23,304
Pretty freaky, huh?

1419
01:48:23,478 --> 01:48:26,447
Did you see Arthur?
He's wandering around here somewhere.

1420
01:48:28,983 --> 01:48:32,248
I'm kidding. Lighten up.

1421
01:48:33,821 --> 01:48:37,518
You got one of these? It's a great memo.
It's an oldie but a goodie.

1422
01:48:40,695 --> 01:48:42,162
Got your heart racing, don't I?

1423
01:48:42,330 --> 01:48:44,457
I don't know what it is
you think you're doing.

1424
01:48:44,632 --> 01:48:45,997
What do you think I'm doing?

1425
01:48:46,167 --> 01:48:47,964
The suit's over. We have a deal.

1426
01:48:48,136 --> 01:48:50,832
Whatever that is,
it's meaningless at this point.

1427
01:48:51,005 --> 01:48:54,668
You think? I must have gotten it wrong.
I thought you had a tentative proposal.

1428
01:48:54,842 --> 01:48:57,037
I didn't realize you'd signed
all those checks.

1429
01:48:57,211 --> 01:49:00,510
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these.
What am I gonna do with them?

1430
01:49:00,682 --> 01:49:02,013
I'm calling Marty.

1431
01:49:02,183 --> 01:49:04,549
Good. Good. Do it.
That's a great place to start.

1432
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:07,517
Let's find out who told him
Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.

1433
01:49:07,689 --> 01:49:09,520
Let's find out who tapped those phones.

1434
01:49:09,691 --> 01:49:13,491
This memorandum, even if it's authentic,
which I doubt, I highly doubt--

1435
01:49:13,661 --> 01:49:17,097
-I know what you did to Arthur.
-It's protected. It belongs to U/North.

1436
01:49:17,265 --> 01:49:20,029
-I know you killed him.
-It's attorney-client privilege.

1437
01:49:20,201 --> 01:49:23,864
See, now, that's just not
the way to go here, Karen.

1438
01:49:24,038 --> 01:49:26,734
For such a smart person,
you really are lost, aren't you?

1439
01:49:26,908 --> 01:49:28,239
This conversation is over.

1440
01:49:28,409 --> 01:49:31,845
I'm not the guy that you kill.
I'm the guy that you buy.

1441
01:49:32,013 --> 01:49:34,538
Are you so fucking blind
you don't even see what I am?

1442
01:49:34,716 --> 01:49:38,208
I'm the easiest part of your whole
goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?

1443
01:49:38,519 --> 01:49:41,647
Don't you know who I am?
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.

1444
01:49:41,823 --> 01:49:45,224
I do everything from shoplifting housewives
to bent congressmen...

1445
01:49:45,393 --> 01:49:47,293
...and you're gonna kill me?

1446
01:49:48,229 --> 01:49:51,062
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.

1447
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:54,929
You want a carry permit? You want
a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?

1448
01:49:55,103 --> 01:49:58,937
I sold out Arthur for 80 grand
and a contract and you're gonna kill me?

1449
01:50:00,441 --> 01:50:01,874
What do you want?

1450
01:50:02,043 --> 01:50:03,567
What do I want?

1451
01:50:03,745 --> 01:50:05,337
I want more.

1452
01:50:05,847 --> 01:50:07,610
I want out.

1453
01:50:07,782 --> 01:50:10,410
And with this, I want everything.

1454
01:50:12,186 --> 01:50:13,414
Is there a number?

1455
01:50:13,588 --> 01:50:15,180
Ten is a number.

1456
01:50:15,356 --> 01:50:17,381
Ten? Ten what?

1457
01:50:19,427 --> 01:50:20,917
Ten million?

1458
01:50:21,095 --> 01:50:24,531
Where do you think I'm gonna get
1 0 million dollars?

1459
01:50:25,099 --> 01:50:26,999
You know what's great about this?

1460
01:50:27,168 --> 01:50:29,466
Did you read it to the end?
You see who signed it?

1461
01:50:30,038 --> 01:50:31,938
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...

1462
01:50:32,106 --> 01:50:35,098
...if he wants to pass the hat
for a worthy cause.

1463
01:50:36,944 --> 01:50:39,344
This would have to be
a longer conversation...

1464
01:50:39,514 --> 01:50:41,641
...and would have to take place
somewhere else.

1465
01:50:41,816 --> 01:50:43,306
Where? My car?

1466
01:50:44,886 --> 01:50:45,910
All right.

1467
01:50:47,088 --> 01:50:50,114
I'm gonna make it easy. Let's make it 5.

1468
01:50:50,291 --> 01:50:52,088
Five and I'll forget about Arthur.

1469
01:50:54,462 --> 01:50:59,229
Five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something
that we could talk about.

1470
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:03,131
Good. And then the other 5 is
to forget about the 468 people...

1471
01:51:03,304 --> 01:51:05,397
...that you knocked off
with your weed killer.

1472
01:51:05,573 --> 01:51:07,939
Let me finish up this meeting.
I'll talk to Don--

1473
01:51:08,109 --> 01:51:10,703
Do I look like I'm negotiating?!

1474
01:51:10,878 --> 01:51:12,209
Karen?

1475
01:51:12,914 --> 01:51:14,779
-One second.
-Everything okay?

1476
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:17,139
Yes.

1477
01:51:18,152 --> 01:51:21,952
Ten million dollars. Bank of my choosing.
Offshore. lmmediately.

1478
01:51:22,123 --> 01:51:23,249
-Yes.
-Say it!

1479
01:51:23,424 --> 01:51:27,292
Ten million dollars, your account,
the moment this meeting is through.

1480
01:51:27,462 --> 01:51:29,760
-Karen! Everyone's waiting.
-I'm coming, Don.

1481
01:51:30,798 --> 01:51:32,163
You have a deal.

1482
01:51:32,734 --> 01:51:33,996
You're so fucked.

1483
01:51:34,335 --> 01:51:35,666
What?

1484
01:51:36,170 --> 01:51:38,035
-You're fucked.
-What do you mean?

1485
01:51:38,206 --> 01:51:40,436
-Take a wild guess.
-Is there a problem?

1486
01:51:40,608 --> 01:51:43,304
-I don't understand.
-Let me get a picture while I'm at it.

1487
01:51:43,478 --> 01:51:46,276
-You don't want the money?
-Keep the money. You'll need it.

1488
01:51:46,447 --> 01:51:48,039
Is this fellow bothering you?

1489
01:51:48,216 --> 01:51:49,444
Am I bothering you?

1490
01:51:49,617 --> 01:51:53,644
Karen, I've got a board waiting in there.
What the hell's going on? Who are you?

1491
01:51:53,821 --> 01:51:55,516
I'm Shiva, the god of death.

1492
01:51:55,690 --> 01:51:59,319
Ron! Ronny, I need security
out here immediately.

1493
01:52:00,228 --> 01:52:01,490
All right. Here we go.

1494
01:52:01,662 --> 01:52:04,859
That guy right there, stop him.
Grab that guy.

1495
01:52:06,467 --> 01:52:09,197
-What are you doing?
-We're detectives with the N.Y.P.D.

1496
01:52:09,370 --> 01:52:11,702
Come back with us
and we'll explain everything.

1497
01:52:11,873 --> 01:52:15,138
Check on her. Make sure she doesn't need
any medical attention.

1498
01:52:15,309 --> 01:52:17,470
You guys go into the ballroom.
Nobody leaves.

1499
01:52:17,645 --> 01:52:19,408
Have your guys cover every exit.

1500
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:22,378
Will you please explain to me
what's going on here?

1501
01:52:23,017 --> 01:52:24,382
Did you get all that?

1502
01:52:24,552 --> 01:52:26,747
Yeah. Got it.

1503
01:52:30,391 --> 01:52:33,224
-You okay?
-Yeah. Just gotta get some air.

1504
01:52:33,394 --> 01:52:34,884
Sure.

1505
01:52:35,263 --> 01:52:38,027
Just stay close, okay?

1506
01:52:38,199 --> 01:52:39,427
Okay.

1507
01:53:50,071 --> 01:53:51,902
So, what are we doing?

1508
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:00,971
Give me 50 dollars' worth.

1509
01:54:02,850 --> 01:54:04,511
Just drive.

1510
01:59:49,763 --> 01:59:51,754
