1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,130
1 YEAR AND 6 MONTHS AGO

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,840
Yes.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,180
I heard you wanted to see me.

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,180
Have a seat.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,180
Okay.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,060
How are things at Homicide?

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,600
There must have been a lot of talk
after what happened to Chief Kook.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,570
You've been guiding us well
ever since you were appointed,

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,860
so I think we're stable
and changing for the better.

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,320
All we need to do is catch Jang Sungtae.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,080
Yes, that's right.

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,540
But he's holed up somewhere,
so we haven't been able to locate him.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,290
You of all people would know where,
wouldn't you, Detective Han?

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,550
I would?

15
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,680
You've probably received a lot
while spying for Chairman Jang.

16
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,310
You must have provided him
with a hideout at least.

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,070
Shit, why did he pick a place like this?
What the hell...

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,290
Hands in the air!

19
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,290
-What is this? Wait.
- Team Leader Han Giyong?

20
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,210
We're from the Inspection Department.

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,010
Punk!

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,720
Darn you!

23
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:45,980
Get him!

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,520
Freeze!

25
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,400
Drop the knife.

26
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,410
Drop it, you bastard!

27
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,830
Hey, are you okay?

28
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,040
Who are you all?

29
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,210
Who the hell are you?

30
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,380
Are you okay, Team Leader Yeon?

31
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,300
Don't move, you bastards!

32
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,220
Drop the knife.

33
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,350
I said, drop the knife!

34
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,650
I'm blowing his head next.

35
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,060
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Abort.</i></font>

36
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,420
SHADOW DETECTIVE SEASON 2

37
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,430
I see you're having a hard time
because of that arson case.

38
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,060
It'll be taken care of soon.

39
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,190
It should be.

40
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,440
And tomorrow,

41
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,030
Choi Dohyung's foundation will be
put through search and seizure.

42
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,780
Chief Prosecutor Won
will take care of everything,

43
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,790
but the police should be prepared too.

44
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,580
Yes, sir.

45
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,120
GEUMO HOUSE

46
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,670
-<i><font color="#80FFFF">The operation failed.</i></font>

47
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,300
We were sabotaged.

48
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,360
How dare you risk your life like that?

49
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,860
This is all I learned from you.
What else am I supposed to do?

50
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,750
Yes, sir.

51
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,380
You told me

52
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,630
we should look out for each other.

53
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,180
- You, don't even think about--
- That's why...

54
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,230
I'll just take care of you
until you hit 60.

55
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,690
Let's go.

56
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,480
We'll be in the car, then.

57
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,540
I've explained everything
to the higher-ups.

58
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,340
We'll interrogate
Team Leader Han at a safe house

59
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,760
and move him to the Agency's
Inspection Department tomorrow.

60
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,010
One phone call was enough
to explain all this?

61
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,810
When all the Inspection department
members were injured?

62
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,890
And they were okay with that?

63
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,730
Let's talk on the way.

64
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,620
My mission

65
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,790
is to go after a private organization
within the police.

66
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,340
A private organization?

67
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,300
A group that's been spreading like poison
for a long time now.

68
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,090
We believe that this private organization

69
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,350
is involved in Jang Sungtae's
and Kook Jinhan's cases.

70
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,770
That's why we've been paying
close attention to Woo Jangik,

71
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,100
the realtor who had been buying
the redevelopment district.

72
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,860
Both Chairman Jang and Chief Kook
were after Geumo City, after all.

73
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,110
Was Kook Jinhan
a part of that organization?

74
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,150
We can't be sure.

75
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,700
None of the members are identified.

76
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,910
That's why they chose me,
though I was from Women and Juveniles.

77
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,660
They had to hide
the Inspection department's involvement.

78
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,710
The men who showed up earlier...

79
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,630
We expected there to be armed forces
that work for them.

80
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,630
But this is the first time
I've seen them myself.

81
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,470
But those men earlier
were only after Team Leader Han.

82
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,150
<i><font color="#80FFFF">We received an anonymous tip-off
about an employee in our station</i></font>

83
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,320
trying to cover up the investigation
on the murder of Woo Jangik.

84
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,820
It's Chief Baek.

85
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,990
Chief Baek is controlling them

86
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,120
for Lee Youngho.

87
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,380
You got the closest.

88
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,130
What are you talking about?

89
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,470
To them.

90
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,510
You've gotten the closest to them
than anyone in the Inspection Department.

91
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,310
Things are different now.

92
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,970
They've found out about us.

93
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,150
Why are you doing all this?

94
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,530
What about you?

95
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,450
As a government employee
working for the country,

96
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,460
this is the job description.

97
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,840
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

98
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,270
Let them through.

99
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,890
Ma'am.

100
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Mr. Han Giyong.

101
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,150
You're currently under investigation
for the murder of Woo Jangik and arson.

102
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,150
Who ordered you to do this?

103
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,110
This is a load of bullshit. Hey.

104
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,490
Are you the one behind all this?

105
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,790
Did you use me to introduce
Chief Seo to Lee Youngho?

106
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,410
Answer me.

107
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,500
Fuck this.

108
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,550
I really must be getting rusty, aren't I?

109
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,510
I got fucking played by Kim Taekrok.

110
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,300
Have you learned nothing
after all the shit you've been through?

111
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,890
Is it that fucking hard
to just lay low and retire?

112
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,510
- You fucking bastard!
-Calm down.

113
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,510
Calm down?

114
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,140
What the fuck
can the Inspection Department do?

115
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,100
Nothing.

116
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,780
What are you doing?

117
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,990
What are you...

118
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,500
Go.

119
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,670
I said go, you prick.

120
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,540
What the fuck are you playing at?

121
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,380
- What are you...
-Go.

122
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,590
-What?
-Runaway if you can, you bastard.

123
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,890
How far do you think you can run?

124
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,260
How far?

125
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,770
Can you make it out of Geumo?

126
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,230
I'm curious.

127
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,350
What would they do
to keep you from squealing?

128
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,610
I know...

129
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,070
everything you've done.

130
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,680
FRIEND, 5:27 A.M.

131
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,280
You scumbag!

132
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,150
I'm really going to kill you!

133
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,700
<i><font color="#80FFFF">That was a warning for your friend.</i></font>

134
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,070
Where are you right now?

135
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,160
So you can lose your cool.

136
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,740
You seem more human now.

137
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,580
That's all just fucking speculation.

138
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,710
You have no evidence!

139
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,710
The death of Chairman Jang and Chief Kook!

140
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,720
What are you going to do
about Chairman Jang?

141
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,180
Just give us the information.

142
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,600
We'll take care of it.

143
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,820
Taekrok.

144
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,900
You don't know what they're like.

145
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,410
All you have to do is testify.

146
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,580
How would you ever guarantee my safety?

147
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,250
Getting investigated under our watch
is the safest choice you have.

148
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,170
This is your last chance.

149
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,630
It's the only way you'll live.

150
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,680
Fuck! This is fucking messed up.

151
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,860
Will you guarantee my safety?

152
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,490
Of course,
as long as you cooperate.

153
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,960
There's not much that I know.

154
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,210
I just did what Chief Baek told me to do.

155
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,380
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'd like you to get rid of Woo Jangik.</i></font>

156
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,380
You're telling me to kill him?

157
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,720
I don't think I can do that.

158
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,180
Section Chief
at the Youngseo Provincial Police Agency.

159
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,310
And that's just the beginning.

160
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,600
Let's have you reach
the main headquarters.

161
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,820
What? Do you think I'm bluffing?

162
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,740
Geumjeong Society doesn't make promises
it can't keep.

163
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,320
That's all that I know.

164
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,700
Geumjeong Society?

165
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,340
Don't go straight to the station
but go to Dongbum's office.

166
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,380
Secure footage from the cameras
near the scene of the accident.

167
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,180
And track the vehicles

168
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,180
- that got away earlier.
- Yes, sir.

169
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,390
Anything we find out from now on
is strictly confidential.

170
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,560
Understood.

171
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,850
And...

172
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,690
Always be careful!

173
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,530
Yes, sir.

174
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,370
- You too, kid.
- Yes, sir.

175
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,460
Things will get wild starting tomorrow.

176
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,210
It'll be dangerous,
so back out while you can.

177
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,630
You're really hurting my feelings.

178
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,170
I can't.

179
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,340
I've seen too much.

180
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,050
Detective Kim really put
everything on the line.

181
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,800
How can I back out after seeing that?

182
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,570
Yes?

183
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,980
<i><font color="#80FFFF">There are no cameras within the vicinity.</i></font>

184
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,490
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'll look around
the nearby roads again tomorrow.</i></font>

185
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,620
CCTV FOOTAGE

186
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,350
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It's definitely the same person.</i></font>

187
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,490
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The one who was present...</i></font>

188
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,250
<i><font color="#80FFFF">at both sites where Kook Jinhan
and Chairman Jang each died...</i></font>

189
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,840
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The one who was in that car...</i></font>

190
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,380
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The one who killed
Kook Jinhan and Chairman Jang...</i></font>

191
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,880
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I finally found a clue to catch him.</i></font>

192
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,600
There's this man whom Chief Baek refers to
as Director Kwon.

193
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,060
It seemed like he acts as the enforcer.

194
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,480
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Director Kwon and his men
aren't just regular thugs.</i></font>

195
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,320
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Abort.</i></font>

196
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,450
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It seemed they'd received SWAT training.</i></font>

197
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,630
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The picture is complete.</i></font>

198
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,380
<i><font color="#80FFFF">All we have to do is catch them
one by one.</i></font>

199
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,620
JULY 11, 2005, GEUMJEONG?

200
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,540
"Geumjeong."

201
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,340
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Geumjeong Society.</i></font>

202
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,090
DECLARATION OF SUPPORT
FOR CANDIDATE NO. 2 KIM JINSUN

203
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,020
Today, I have the honor
of welcoming to my campaign

204
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,530
a person beloved and respected
by the citizens of Youngseo Province.

205
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,860
He had dedicated himself to fighting
violent crime in Korea for decades

206
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,830
and now oversees the welfare
and development of his hometown.

207
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,000
Please welcome Director Choi Dohyung.

208
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Hello.

209
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,880
I'm Director Choi Dohyung
of Youngseo Foundation.

210
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,390
YOUNGSEO WELFARE FOUNDATION

211
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,660
In line with our shared aspirations

212
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,080
for the development of Geumo and Youngseo,

213
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,710
I've decided to support
Ms. Kim Jinsun's candidacy.

214
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,510
We will work together from now on
for the underprivileged children,

215
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,720
and in the future, for every child in...

216
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,020
Director Choi Dohyung.

217
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,980
We've received reports
of embezzlement of state subsidies

218
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,440
and the abuse of children
by the Youngseo Welfare Foundation.

219
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,400
We'll have to conduct
an urgent search and seizure.

220
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,870
What are you talking about?

221
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,870
On what grounds are you doing this?

222
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,710
Director Choi, what is going on?

223
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,670
My goodness, you didn't have to
turn the place inside out.

224
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,670
It's the Director's office after all.

225
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,920
If you're done, step outside and wait.

226
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,030
Turns out you can find thousands of faults

227
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,570
with welfare foundations
once you dig into them.

228
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,660
It's not that I'm suspicious
of your intentions,

229
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,080
but we do need to get things straight
since there was a report.

230
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,420
You understand, don't you?

231
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,510
Was it Congressman Lee Youngho
who asked you to barge in

232
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,760
right when I was announcing my support
for Candidate Kim's campaign?

233
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,550
You'd know the answer to that.

234
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,810
Well, think what you will.

235
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,850
It seems that Congressman Lee

236
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,770
is still in control
of Youngseo's prosecution,

237
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,570
seeing as how he has no one less

238
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,780
than the chief prosecutor himself
as his puppet.

239
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,410
I don't think
you have the time for that right now.

240
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,910
I'm aware.

241
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:04,630
I'm sure you've already prepared
the evidence to malign me well in advance.

242
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,380
So you're aware.

243
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,760
Well then,
you ought to have known better then.

244
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,430
I'll get going now. Ah.

245
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,890
You'll probably be notified
of your subpoena schedule soon.

246
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,190
Chief Prosecutor Won.

247
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,490
GEUMO POLICE STATION

248
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,700
I see.

249
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,120
It seems there were a lot of coincidences.

250
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,370
You just happened
to run into juvenile delinquents

251
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,960
in a place with no security cameras.

252
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,880
And Detective Lee Seonga happened
to be nearby and came over to help.

253
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,670
And Detective Son Gyeongchan

254
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,420
just happened to bring detectives
from the precinct afterward.

255
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,590
We'll search the area again
and submit our report.

256
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
No.

257
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,430
I have a more important task for you,
Team Leader Yeon.

258
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,770
Go to Director Choi Dohyung's
welfare foundation

259
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,940
and investigate
for any sign of child abuse.

260
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,610
I guess you haven't heard the news yet.

261
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,400
The place is under search and seizure.

262
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,580
GEUMO NEWS

263
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,290
A HERO IN CRISIS,
WILL CHOI DOHYUNG'S TRUE FACE BE REVEALED?

264
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,000
They're probably trying
to put pressure on him

265
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,040
for announcing his support
for Candidate Kim.

266
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,590
And they're keeping me busy too.

267
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,680
Do you think

268
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,050
Chief Baek caught on that you're with
the Inspection Department?

269
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,430
Probably.

270
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,850
How much...

271
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,640
does he know already?

272
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,730
Still, he won't be able to move so freely.

273
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,530
Since he has to keep
his identity a secret.

274
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,570
There are only two days left
until the election.

275
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,990
If things stay this way,
Lee Youngho will be elected.

276
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,580
Then Geumjeong Society
might go back into hiding again.

277
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,920
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Two days.</i></font>

278
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,470
<i><font color="#80FFFF">There's no time.</i></font>

279
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,890
- Did you look into it?
-<i><font color="#80FFFF">Yes.</i></font>

280
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,640
I looked into it through our guys
at the Inspection Department.

281
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,640
But this is...

282
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,650
It's being handled by the chief
of the Inspection Department himself.

283
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,570
<i><font color="#80FFFF">So there's not much I can find out.</i></font>

284
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,570
Well,

285
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,700
I've been fooled this whole time
since they sent her undercover

286
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,410
as the Team Leader of Women and Juveniles.

287
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,490
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But there's one thing you should know.</i></font>

288
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,870
Tell me.

289
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,710
Yeon Juhyun's father is someone you know.

290
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,670
What?

291
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,680
You met with Secretary Cha
yesterday, right?

292
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
Yes.

293
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,010
I need you to give Lee Youngho
a present through Secretary Cha.

294
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
- You're here.
- You got anything?

295
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,940
None of these cars are registered.

296
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,780
It'll take days to trace back
the route they used to travel.

297
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,950
I'm back.

298
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,320
How did it go with the hospitals?

299
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,120
I searched from university hospital ERs
to local clinics,

300
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,580
and there were no gunshot wound patients.

301
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,760
Look into anyone who retired
from SWAT teams in the last ten years.

302
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,470
It doesn't matter
whether they retired early or were fired.

303
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,800
If you find anything strange,
let them know.

304
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,140
That's going to be a lot.

305
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,930
Which is why you should get started.

306
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,100
Do you think they're former police?

307
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,770
They're trained. They move differently.

308
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,570
They were exchanging hand signals.

309
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,440
It'll take a while
to look into each of them.

310
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,440
How do we catch them?

311
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,780
We'll have to make them
come out of hiding.

312
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,820
Look at this.

313
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,910
LOCAL ELECTIONS D-2

314
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,830
UNPREDICTABLE ELECTION
FOR YOUNGSEO GOVERNOR

315
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,340
"Predictions on the governor election
of Youngseo Province are in chaos

316
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,630
with Director Choi, who announced
his support for Candidate Kim,

317
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,340
being placed under search and seizure
by the prosecution."

318
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,430
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Lee Youngho has taken it too far.</i></font>

319
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,390
We're going to aim
for Lee Youngho's weak spot

320
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,400
while he's at his most vulnerable.

321
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,190
His nephew's drug scandal
right before the election...

322
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,530
He'll try to stop it no matter what.

323
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,490
If we let them catch a whiff,

324
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,530
they'll show themselves again.

325
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,300
-Hello, sir.
- Hello.

326
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,220
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

327
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,310
Of course.

328
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,190
I was actually

329
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,730
wanting to meet with you too.

330
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,400
Ah, is that so?

331
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,950
I thought I told you.

332
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,070
That I might be of help
to Assemblyman Lee soon.

333
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,870
Well, I heard a rumor
that's entirely different.

334
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,420
A rumor?

335
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,550
The word that the person
who made you approach the assemblyman...

336
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,090
was Detective Kim Taekrok.

337
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,810
Who on earth said that?

338
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,610
A guest has arrived.

339
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,580
Sir, my name is Baek Seongil.

340
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,510
Are you done interviewing the children?

341
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,300
Yes, Director Choi.

342
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,510
Sorry that I can't tell you
the result of the investigation.

343
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,640
I know.

344
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,440
I have a different favor to ask.

345
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,480
What might that be?

346
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,070
If something were to happen to me
and this facility gets shut down,

347
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:51,120
please make sure
all the children here get somewhere safe.

348
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,540
Why say something like that already?

349
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,580
The charges haven't been proven yet.

350
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,080
The election is right around the corner.

351
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,050
Someone like me without any connections
doesn't stand a chance

352
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,630
against those who suppress him.

353
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,840
What is wrong will be corrected.

354
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,600
Do you trust me?

355
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,820
Detective Kim Taekrok
is very worried about you as well.

356
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,990
All right.

357
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,860
You should get going. You must be busy.

358
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,530
Yes.

359
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,590
Did I say something funny?

360
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,680
No, I'm sorry.

361
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,390
But I couldn't help laughing
at something so ridiculous.

362
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,520
Look here.

363
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,810
You must not know
who put me through all this trouble

364
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,980
for you to come to that conclusion.

365
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,730
It was Kim Taekrok.

366
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,570
I wouldn't have gone to prison
if it weren't for him!

367
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:13,950
So there really is no connection
between you and Detective Kim?

368
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,290
There was a connection all right.

369
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,620
A rotten one.

370
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,750
That's why you're suspecting me
of being involved with the likes of him

371
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,170
as I am handing over
my precious slush fund.

372
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,090
Don't you agree, Mr. Cha?

373
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,480
You don't seem like you believe me,
Chief Baek.

374
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,690
Words don't prove anything.

375
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,740
You want me to prove my loyalty
toward Assemblyman Lee.

376
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,700
Can you?

377
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,460
I'll prove it
before the assemblyman himself.

378
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,260
Hello, Assemblyman Lee. I'm Seo Gwangsu.

379
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,600
Right, I heard you said
you had to meet with me.

380
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,650
Yes.

381
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:26,060
I hope this is worth
taking time out of my busy schedule.

382
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,400
I'm sure it will be.

383
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,400
This could affect the result
of the election that's in two days.

384
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,960
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Mr. Son here is trying</i></font>

385
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,670
<i><font color="#80FFFF">to get big in the drug business.</i></font>

386
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,970
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I thought he'd be able
to talk to you about business.</i></font>

387
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,470
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Drug business?</i></font>

388
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,470
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Don't pretend you don't know.</i></font>

389
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,850
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I know you made some good money
back in the day.</i></font>

390
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,440
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Oh, dear.</i></font>

391
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,280
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'm not sure
if there are any dealers left in Geumo.</i></font>

392
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,610
Tell Lee Youngho
that Yong Hwanju is doing drugs.

393
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,660
<i><font color="#80FFFF">What?</i></font>

394
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,740
You want to hand over his only weak spot?

395
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,410
It's so that Chief Baek will get his men
moving to rid him of that weakness.

396
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Talk to Yong Hwanju</i></font>

397
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,830
<i><font color="#80FFFF">as if you're setting him up
with a buyer in China.</i></font>

398
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,920
And tell him to bring
a sample of the drug there.

399
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,250
You're trying to shoot
all the birds with one stone.

400
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,380
Gwangsu.

401
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,170
There's no time.

402
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,260
We have to end this with one go.

403
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,890
<i><font color="#80FFFF">So why don't you coach us?</i></font>

404
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,140
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Invest in us and look out for us.</i></font>

405
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,850
<i><font color="#80FFFF">If you do that,
I'll take good care of you for sure.</i></font>

406
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,530
Wouldn't it be a huge disaster

407
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,650
if your opposition
were to find out about this?

408
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,870
- Mr. Cha.
-Yes?

409
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,160
Did you not know about this?

410
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,580
I apologize, sir.

411
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,410
Where's Hwanju?

412
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,670
Tell him to come here immediately.

413
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,340
I haven't been able
to reach him since earlier.

414
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,050
So you're just sitting there?

415
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,840
What kind of idiot are you?

416
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Assemblyman Lee.

417
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:22,510
To tell you the truth,
I heard something earlier today.

418
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,750
Are you ready?

419
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,760
Yes, the Inspection Department
agreed to dispatch their squad.

420
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,180
I barely managed to persuade them.

421
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,640
The director has been in a bad mood
since what happened yesterday.

422
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,100
This might be your last chance,
for a number of reasons.

423
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,980
Anyway, good luck. I'll get going now.

424
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,550
Yes, Taekrok.

425
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,710
Yes, did you look into it?

426
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,630
Yes. Nothing came out
of Yeon Sanghoon's autopsy.

427
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,010
<i><font color="#80FFFF">So they just brushed it off
as a car accident.</i></font>

428
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,510
They didn't have any evidence.
And there were no suspects.

429
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,310
- <i><font color="#80FFFF">But...</i></font>
- But?

430
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,770
He took a leave of absence
about a month before he died.

431
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,650
A leave of absence? Why?

432
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,980
That's a bit strange.

433
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,160
There's no specific reason.

434
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,160
<i><font color="#80FFFF">A leave of absence
without a known reason...</i></font>

435
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,790
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Yeon Juhyun did the same.</i></font>

436
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,590
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Did her father die working on a mission
for the Inspection Department?</i></font>

437
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,560
Mr. Cha.

438
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,850
Yes, sir.

439
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,480
Prepare to send Hwanju off overseas.

440
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,690
Yes. I'll make the arrangements.

441
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,490
He may be family...

442
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,110
but I've been too soft on him,
that fucking fool.

443
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,570
Don't worry too much.

444
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,240
I'll get things done within tonight.

445
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,330
Perhaps this could be a good thing.

446
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,120
We'll be able to take care
of all the people...

447
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,250
leeching off Director Yong.

448
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,090
And keep an eye on Seo Gwangsu.

449
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,680
He dares to wiretap
the person who introduced him.

450
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,590
He can't be trusted.

451
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,930
Take care of him
if he does anything fishy.

452
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,890
Yes, sir.

453
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,230
What now?

454
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,360
It seems like something went wrong
on Chief Prosecutor Won's end.

455
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,780
What are you talking about?

456
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,800
Why did you bring so many people?
Isn't this too obvious?

457
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,760
Those Chinese bastards can be scary.
Haven't you heard of the Triad?

458
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,810
Did you make sure to bring the sample?

459
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,230
Of course.

460
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,440
It's the real deal.

461
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,570
- I do know a decent buyer.
- You do?

462
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,940
Get a sample ready and wait.

463
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,740
I'll try to set up a meeting for tonight.

464
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,890
You have your gun on you, right?

465
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,600
Yes, sir.

466
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,650
The squad
sent by the Inspection Department

467
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,230
<i><font color="#80FFFF">is on standby a minute away from here.</i></font>

468
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,820
<i><font color="#80FFFF">All right.</i></font>

469
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,920
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Tonight,</i></font>

470
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:05,380
<i><font color="#80FFFF">the tiny ripple made by a pebble
will come back as a tidal wave.</i></font>

471
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,550
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Today,
you placed Director Choi's foundation</i></font>

472
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,550
<i><font color="#80FFFF">under search and seizure.</i></font>

473
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:11,180
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Was there any evidence
on the embezzlement of state subsidies?</i></font>

474
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,350
<i><font color="#80FFFF">No, not yet.</i></font>

475
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,720
<i><font color="#80FFFF">We're going over the possibility
that it was a false report.</i></font>

476
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,810
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Then are you saying
that this was a political attack</i></font>

477
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,810
<i><font color="#80FFFF">on Director Choi Dohyung
and Candidate Kim Jinsun?</i></font>

478
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,560
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I can't tell you anything further
other than the fact</i></font>

479
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,360
<i><font color="#80FFFF">that the Youngseo Prosecutor's Office
will not be used for any politics.</i></font>

480
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,740
-<i><font color="#80FFFF">Just a moment.</i></font>
- Won Jaegu, that son of a bitch!

481
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,900
This is Choi Dohyung's doing!

482
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,110
Sir, please calm down for...

483
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,450
It doesn't take a lot to find
Won Jaegu's weakness to control him.

484
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,870
This was a mistake!

485
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,080
Calm down, sir.

486
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,790
This won't affect the election that much.

487
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,250
If things take a wrong turn,

488
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:44,210
that retired policeman
might win against me.

489
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,380
That won't happen, sir.

490
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,630
- Chief Baek.
- Yes, sir.

491
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,010
Kill him.

492
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,260
What do you think?

493
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,260
Wouldn't that solve everything?

494
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,760
You can't, sir. Director Yong is...

495
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,390
Get out!

496
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,390
- Sir...
- I said get out!

497
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,220
You're right, sir.

498
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,480
It's best to get rid of
the root of the problem.

499
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,770
I knew I'd be able to get through to you.

500
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,230
Can you take care of it tonight
along with Hwanju?

501
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,990
Of course.

502
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:58,080
This is why you've supported
Geumjeong Society all this time.

503
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,880
Yes, all right.

504
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,690
You might want to play,

505
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,650
but you have to sleep
to wake up in the morning.

506
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,950
- They're here. What do we do?
- Should we dispatch the squad?

507
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,250
No. Wait until they all move.

508
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,250
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Yes, sir.</i></font>

509
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,380
What?

510
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,560
What the hell is going on?

511
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,310
What the fuck is all this?

512
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,190
- Those fucking bastards...
- Where are you going? Hey!

513
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,610
- Good night.
- Good night.

514
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,290
Let's go.

515
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,190
YOUNGSEO WELFARE FOUNDATION

516
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,740
Does he really have to go this far?

517
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,180
Drop your guns!

518
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,100
Hold still!

519
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,350
Hold still!

520
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,850
Hold still!

521
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,420
Are the transfer team here yet?

522
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,590
It seems like they'll be late.

523
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:00,720
-Go check one more time.
- All right, ma'am.

524
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,640
It seems
that things are getting chaotic again.

525
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,350
Do you...

526
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,150
want me to give you
a piece of sincere advice?

527
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,870
Kim Taekrok.

528
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,590
Don't get too involved with him.

529
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,300
He'll bring you your doom.

530
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,010
Mr. Han Giyong.

531
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,140
Let me ask you something
before you're transferred.

532
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,600
"Geumjeong Society." What does that mean?

533
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,110
"Geumjeong."

534
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,150
What does "Geumjeong" mean?

535
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,820
That...

536
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,570
is for you to find out yourself.

537
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:24,880
Who are you people?

538
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,680
Are you the police? Where are you from?

539
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,100
Homicide at Geumo station.

540
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,600
Where are you from?

541
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:35,850
Narcotics at Youngseo Provincial
Police Agency.

542
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,560
How did you know to come here?

543
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,360
We're carrying out an operation
to arrest a drug offender

544
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,530
upon request from Chief Baek Seongil.

545
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:42,990
Was there a mistake?

546
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,990
What happened?

547
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,120

548
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,920
<i><font color="#80FFFF">What am I missing?</i></font>

549
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,920
So does Geumjeong Society
work only for Lee Youngho?

550
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,460
I don't know much about that,

551
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,720
but the thing Geumjeong Society
deemed the most important

552
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,930
was the organization itself.

553
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,510
<i><font color="#80FFFF">What's important to them
isn't Lee Youngho's safety.</i></font>

554
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,470
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It's to keep their organization hidden.</i></font>

555
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,810
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And what do they need to get rid of
to do that?</i></font>

556
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:49,890
What on earth are you doing?

557
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:57,350
So does Lee Youngho now want me dead?

558
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,320
Please understand.

559
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,360
Do you really think this is right?

560
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,330
Do you think it's right
to serve such a master?

561
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:22,000
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The one
that threatens their existence the most</i></font>

562
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,750
<i><font color="#80FFFF">is Team Leader Han.</i></font>

563
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,140
Please take care of it as planned.

564
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:39,560
What on earth do you hope to gain
by serving such a man?

565
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,880
What do you think you're doing?

566
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,090
Are you all right?

567
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,360
This is your last chance.

568
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,200
You walk out that door, and you die.

569
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,210
Team Leader Yeon.

570
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:14,670
Team Leader Yeon.

571
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,630
Hold on.

572
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,390
Wake up.

573
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,190
What choice are you going to make?

574
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:57,510
