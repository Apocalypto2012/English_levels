1
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:08,458
<i>I'm Nick Fury.</i>

2
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,333
<i>Been riding a desk for the past six years</i>

3
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:12,857
<i>trying to figure out where
our future enemies are coming from.</i>

4
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:14,500
Official S.H.I.E.L.D. activity.

5
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,292
Never occurred to me
they would be coming from above.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,292
You say this thing looked like Coulson?

7
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,917
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

8
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:24,417
<i>Shapeshifters.</i>

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,226
<i>We can't trust anyone.</i>

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,458
<i>Not even our own men.</i>

11
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,833
Now I stand before you
as my true self.

12
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:32,833
Without deception.

13
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:34,458
<i>I just wanna talk.</i>

14
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,792
<i>My people lived as refugees, homeless.</i>

15
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,500
- Talos!
- Soren.

16
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:45,875
<i>And the handful of us that are left
will be slaughtered next.</i>

17
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,917
There are thousands of us
separated from each other.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,833
<i>This is just the beginning.</i>

19
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:58,500
They won't be safe here.

20
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:00,875
<i>They need their own home.</i>

21
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,417
Varra. Welcome.

22
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,583
Thank you, Fury.

23
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,833
I'd like you to meet someone.

24
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:48,625
This is Gravik.

25
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,625
Gravik.

26
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:01,208
His parents were killed
in the last stand against the Kree.

27
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:07,042
He escaped from behind enemy lines,
piloted a ship all on his own.

28
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,208
He is smart, Fury. Knows how to survive.

29
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,292
We could use someone like him.

30
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,542
He's a child.

31
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,833
Only to human eyes.

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,792
Just talk to him.

33
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:32,792
Gravik. Sorry to hear about your parents.

34
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,708
They died a brilliant death.

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,625
I'm sure they did.

36
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,750
This work here...

37
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,917
you know it's very dangerous.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,250
I'm not afraid.

39
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,583
I can see you're not.

40
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:08,167
I wanna thank you all for...
For joining me.

41
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,417
I know it's been a...
It's been a rough journey.

42
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,458
We went looking for a home,
found nothing but violence.

43
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:21,542
And hate.

44
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,333
All of us have lost someone.

45
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:27,875
Or everyone.

46
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:35,500
And our entire species
is scattered across the galaxy,

47
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:40,042
but for those of you
who braved the journey here to Earth,

48
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:44,083
you did so for one reason.

49
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:47,708
This man.

50
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:53,375
This man that I trust.

51
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,292
You know I don't use that word lightly.

52
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:00,083
Thank you, Talos.

53
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,917
My friends, ever since...

54
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:08,000
Let me rephrase that.

55
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,458
Almost ever since I met Talos,

56
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,417
I believed that humans
and Skrulls can help each other.

57
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:23,167
The world is facing a serious threat.

58
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,750
And I could use your help.

59
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:29,792
It would mean putting on a new face

60
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,458
and keeping it.

61
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,542
This is the promise.

62
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:40,750
While you work to keep my home safe,

63
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,750
Carol Danvers and I
will find you a new one.

64
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,958
Who'll be first to take the pledge?

65
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,125
Thank you, Soren.

66
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,333
You have a courageous mother, G'iah.

67
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,417
You keep your word...

68
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,792
I'll keep mine.

69
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:27,792
What are you doing?

70
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:30,542
Let go of me.

71
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:34,875
I'm an American!
I'm an American! I'm an American!

72
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:50,875
I'm an American!

73
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,333
They've gone.

74
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:08,208
You hear anything from G'iah yet?

75
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,750
No, nothing. Not yet.

76
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:31,292
When me and my mama used to
take these long train rides to Detroit...

77
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,875
You know, train travel back then
wasn't nowhere near this elegant.

78
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,333
Comin' out of Alabama,
we always had to ride in the colored car.

79
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,208
It was hot, sweaty.
Bathroom didn't work half the time.

80
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,583
And we couldn't go in the dining car.

81
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:57,875
So, we brought fried chicken, white bread,
deviled eggs, and pound cake in a shoebox.

82
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:04,792
Mmm. Half hour after the train pulled out,
that chicken be gone!

83
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,000
Smelt way too good to wait.

84
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,625
On these long rides,

85
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:15,542
me and my mother would make up games,
pass the time.

86
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,542
"Tell Me Somethin' I Don't Know."

87
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,458
That was one of her favorites.

88
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:26,958
One time she said, "Tell me somethin'
I don't know about you and Suzie."

89
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:32,250
Me and Suzie had a standing game of doctor
we'd been playin'

90
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,375
behind Old Man Jackson's barn.

91
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:38,125
Suffice it to say,
I wasn't about to tell her about that.

92
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,708
So, I made up something crazy like,

93
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:45,042
"Me and Suzie
saw a bullfrog with polka dots."

94
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,667
My mama just smiled.

95
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,542
Even though I'd lied through my teeth,

96
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:54,083
the mere fact that I did that,

97
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:59,000
told her everything she needed to know
about me and Suzie.

98
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,000
Mmm.

99
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,833
Well, you wanna go a few rounds?

100
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,125
Sure.

101
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:17,583
Tell me something I don't know
about the destruction of Skrullos.

102
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:23,917
You know everything
there is to know about it, Fury.

103
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,750
Name of the game
is Tell Me Something I Don't Know.

104
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,250
We were overpowered by the Kree.
We held 'em off for as long as we could.

105
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,208
When we couldn't hold 'em off any longer,

106
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:43,292
the million of us that were left, we fled.

107
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,333
Interesting.

108
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:51,917
Tell me something I don't know
about the Skrulls that fled.

109
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,750
Um...

110
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:58,542
They're here.

111
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,875
Who's here?

112
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,583
All of us.

113
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:05,792
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

114
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:11,542
You're tellin' me there's a million
Skrulls walking amongst us right now?

115
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,917
Have you lost your reptilian-ass mind?

116
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,292
I sent out the call

117
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:22,208
and every Skrull that isn't
in Emperor Drogge's colony, they answered.

118
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,542
You lied to me!

119
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,583
Hey, we were being hunted
across the universe.

120
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,042
I had two choices,

121
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,917
I could let my people be annihilated
or summon 'em here to Earth.

122
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,934
- What would you have done?
- This ain't about me!

123
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,083
Oh, right. But you're fine using us
as your spies and your errand boys,

124
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,333
long as it's on your terms.

125
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:43,625
The host gets to set the terms
of the visitation.

126
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,375
What happens
when the host disappears, huh?

127
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,625
'Cause you were gone!

128
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,417
And I didn't think you were coming back,
I really didn't.

129
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,333
And even when you did come back,

130
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,833
there was no talking to you
about anything real.

131
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,250
Your boots barely hit Earth.

132
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,125
And, "Oh, it's too heavy here, man.
I gotta go up to my space station."

133
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,792
You've been up there for years!

134
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,750
You knew how to get
in touch with me, Talos,

135
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,792
and you didn't
because you didn't want me to know.

136
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,000
My hope...
My hope is that with your help...

137
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:19,125
Skrulls and humans can coexist,
here on Earth.

138
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:23,167
Human can't coexist with each other!
You've been here long enough to know that!

139
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,750
We've been at war with each other
since we could walk upright!

140
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:31,417
There is not enough room or tolerance
on this planet for another species!

141
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,333
Matter of fact,
neither is this train compartment.

142
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:39,792
I think this is your stop.

143
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,667
Oh, my God.

144
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,958
Elizabeth.

145
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,083
Were you there?

146
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,083
Yeah.

147
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,917
How did it happen?

148
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,458
It happened quickly.

149
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,417
Don't you be one of those bastards
who gives me a platitude

150
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,125
when I'm looking for the truth!

151
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,500
That one, over there.
You know what he told me?

152
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,958
He told me that
my nation owes me a debt of gratitude.

153
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:37,125
But he won't even tell me where
on Planet Earth my daughter was killed.

154
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:41,708
So apparently, facts are not included
in the debt I'm owed.

155
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:46,708
She died in Moscow.

156
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,750
We were there trying to stop the attack.

157
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,333
Someone set a trap.

158
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,292
- For her?
- No, for me.

159
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:59,208
Someone wanted to hurt me...

160
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,292
so they hurt her.

161
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,083
Oh.

162
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:11,667
So, you're the reason I'm taking
my daughter back home in a box.

163
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,417
I'm sorry
I couldn't protect her, Elizabeth.

164
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,542
You're Nick Fury.

165
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,625
Maria believed in you.

166
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,917
She would've followed you
to the gates of hell and back.

167
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:37,000
Look, I don't know
what Maria died for out there.

168
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:41,708
But whatever it was,
don't let it be for nothing.

169
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:52,972
<i>Developing Story at this hour.</i>

170
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:56,625

{\an8}<i>The UK Prime Minister</i>
<i>was quick to denounce the attack,</i>

176
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:11,333
{\an8}<i>while the NATO Secretary-General says...</i>

177
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,833
{\an8}<i>Despite the outpouring of condemnation,</i>
<i>all signs point towards</i>

178
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:20,750
{\an8}<i>imminent retaliation from Russia</i>

179
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,208
{\an8}<i>for what the Kremlin regards</i>

180
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:26,250
{\an8}<i>as an all-out declaration of war</i>
<i>by the Americans.</i>

181
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,542
{\an8}<i>They're all saying</i>
<i>we had something to do with Moscow.</i>

182
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,958
{\an8}<i>Well, I call bull on that.</i>

183
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:35,333
{\an8}<i>There's no way that Moscow attack</i>
<i>was committed by Americans.</i>

184
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:38,125
<i>This has got false flag
written all over it.</i>

185
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,917
How did you know Fury would be there?

186
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,167
I didn't.

187
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,500
Well, not to a certainty. But I hoped.

188
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,375
I wanted to see how much of him was left.

189
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,333
And?

190
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:16,333
He's just vapors. Old.

191
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,292
You know,
I could've killed him if I wanted to.

192
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,917
You don't punish a man
by givin' him what he wants.

193
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,750
You just get me to the Council meeting.

194
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,833
I wanna see their faces
while Moscow is still burnin'.

195
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,333
You, wait.

196
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:03,958
Uh, yeah, that's not happening.

197
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:05,042
Gravik.

198
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,417
If I'm not out in an hour,

199
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,833
shoot him in the head.

200
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,458
Members of the Council.

201
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,958
Seems someone didn't get
the suggested attire memo.

202
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:38,375
Well, I also didn't get a formal
invitation, Mr. Secretary-General.

203
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,583
But I'm sure
that was just a curious oversight.

204
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,750
Madam Prime Minister.

205
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:48,667
Hello, Shirley.

206
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:54,583
I trust I speak for the group when I say,
we are all happy to have you with us.

207
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,667
Please sit.

208
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,917
I see you,

209
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,500
all dressed up in the man's finery,
drinking the man's wine.

210
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,250
Playing the man's game,
using the man's fork and knife.

211
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:18,042
Better to behave as a human than as a dog.

212
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:21,375
Well, I quite like dogs.

213
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,583
In fact, I prefer 'em.

214
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:28,792
Dogs aren't hypocrites.
And they don't lie.

215
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,458
They don't lock each other up in cages.

216
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,708
They don't pimp, poison,

217
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:39,500
and they don't go out of their way
to degrade and destroy their own habitat.

218
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,042
A naive reading of human history.

219
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,250
It's the only reading of human history.

220
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:48,875
Are you done?

221
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,417
Perhaps we should get on
with what we came here for.

222
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,542
A prudent suggestion, sister.

223
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,458
Recent acts of terror
in cities across the globe,

224
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:02,125
most notably in Moscow,

225
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:06,583
severely undermine the stability
that this Council seeks to preserve.

226
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:11,833
The purpose of tonight
is to determine what punishment, if any,

227
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:15,917
should be meted out on the individual
who has imperiled us all.

228
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:19,375
You murdered over 2,000 innocent humans.

229
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:20,958
Children.

230
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:23,625
And yet,
you don't seem remotely remorseful.

231
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,625
What the hell gives you the right
to disobey this council?

232
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,333
What gives me the right?

233
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,875
I think it's a war.

234
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,292
I think it's a war!

235
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:22,917
Hmm?

236
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,542
And unlike the last war each one of us
around this table fought in,

237
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,042
I'm not gonna lose this one.

238
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,792
Humans are doomed to self-destruction.

239
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:34,625
Long before we arrived on this planet,
they were destined to consume themselves.

240
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,792
So, for anyone flinching
at the thought of innocent deaths,

241
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:43,083
let me assure you,
we're only hastening the inevitable.

242
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,750
And what happens
if the Avengers return?

243
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,625
You don't think I thought about that?

244
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,125
Put your faith in me.

245
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:56,583
And I promise,
your loyalty will be repaid.

246
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,917
Well, Madam Prime Minister...

247
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,917
We need to streamline
our chain of command.

248
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,708
Democracy is fine for peacetime,
but whilst at war,

249
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:19,458
we need a single commander
whose war power is total and unchecked.

250
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,708
My God!

251
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:25,583
Therefore, I nominate Gravik
to the post of Skrull General.

252
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:26,667
Traitor!

253
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,792
You were in on this with him
the entire time!

254
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,750
Seat yourself down, Sergio.
I'm not done yet.

255
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,583
Who do you think you're talking to?
I'm the commander of NATO.

256
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:36,958
I can mobilize a million troops
at the snap of a...

257
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,875
Shall I remove him, Madame?

258
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,667
Oh, I don't think
he'll be any more trouble.

259
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:51,417
All those in favor of Gravik
as our new general...

260
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:54,542
will submit.

261
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:24,250
I fear each one of you
has forgotten our history.

262
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:29,667
We did not end up homeless refugees
because we were unwilling to wage war.

263
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:34,292
We ended up homeless refugees
because we were too willing.

264
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,250
I do not support your coup.

265
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:41,875
I will not support your war.

266
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,000
And I do not submit.

267
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:49,792
If I had another 100 like you,
I could take on the universe.

268
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,667
You go in peace, sister.
You'll not be harmed.

269
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,708
- Shirley.
<i>- It's Gravik.</i>

270
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:43,208
The Council just voted him General.

271
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:46,292
He has control of our people
and our future.

272
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,833
If there's anything I can do...

273
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:51,917
Yeah, set up a meet
between me and Gravik. Public place.

274
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,500
<i>Talos, he will kill you.</i>

275
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,292
Yeah, thanks for the faith.

276
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:58,083
<i>You don't understand.
Gravik has changed.</i>

277
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,458
So have I. Soren's dead.

278
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:02,292
<i>I know.</i>

279
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:05,208
<i>But if you can't keep it together,
you will not walk out alive.</i>

280
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,458
Shirley, set up the meet.

281
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,958
Just tell him
I wanna talk about my daughter.

282
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:52,333
Thank you, sir.

283
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,833
Without you, this wouldn't be possible.

284
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:14,708
You don't have it.

285
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,125
Harvest wasn't there.

286
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,875
Then it's back to scavenging.

287
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:24,250
Our DNA selection
remains extremely limited.

288
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,958
I'll send out teams.

289
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:28,458
I was told this phase
would be over.

290
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:30,583
So was I.

291
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:35,958
Gravik has given me multiple locations
for the Harvest, all of them empty.

292
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:38,458
Our fearless leader isn't always right.

293
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,375
Perhaps I misheard you.

294
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:44,208
Do you need anything else, Dr. Dalton?

295
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:46,625
Yes. Your absence.

296
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:13,625
In this stunning sign
of just how seriously it regards rumors

297
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:16,042
of American involvement
in the Moscow attacks,

298
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:19,542
the 27 EU heads of state,
plus the British Prime Minster

299
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:22,417
have all but commanded Washington
to account for itself

300
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,792
at this emergency security summit
here in London.

301
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,333
Colonel?

302
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,042
Colonel Rhodes?

303
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:37,292
Colonel, are you denying
that two of your citizens,

304
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:40,708
Mr. Nicholas Fury and Miss Maria Hill,

305
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:44,375
were present in Moscow
at the scene of the attacks?

306
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:49,708
We are aware of allegations
that Mr. Fury and Miss Hill

307
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:51,083
may have traveled to Moscow.

308
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:54,667
Which, if true, it would've been in
their capacity as private citizens, so...

309
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:59,958
Do these photos suffice as confirmation
of that fact, Colonel Rhodes?

310
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:02,875
Respectfully, Prime Minister,

311
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:06,542
I can't take the authenticity
of Russian-supplied photos at face value.

312
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,583
However, I will be more than happy

313
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,042
to have them analyzed
at our facilities at Langley.

314
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:18,333
How do you explain
Mr. Fury's presence in Moscow?

315
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:21,792
Uh, alleged. Alleged presence, madam.

316
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:26,250
If Slovakia rolls its eyes at me
one more time,

317
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,542
I'm gonna put on the suit
and carpet bomb it.

318
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,333
Why are you here, Colonel?

319
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:32,083
You are not a Head of State.

320
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:36,958
Surely, President Ritson
is aware of the seriousness

321
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:40,250
with which his international partners
regard this allegation.

322
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:46,667
Well, I'm here as a courtesy,
Madam Prime Minister.

323
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,792
President Ritson has a pretty busy day job

324
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:52,167
running the most powerful country
and military on the face of the planet.

325
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,875
He doesn't just hop to when summoned.

326
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:57,250
Not by France,
not by Italy, not by the UK.

327
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,958
Now, while we are sensitive
to your concerns,

328
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:04,292
until such time as you can present
an actual shred of evidence

329
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,250
to back those concerns up,

330
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:09,208
I'm afraid sensitivity
is all you're gonna be getting from us.

331
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:12,083
All right?

332
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:24,208
- Rhodes.
<i>- Nice suit. Armani?</i>

333
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:26,875
Brioni.

334
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:27,958
Fury.

335
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:30,250
<i>Pretty expensive for a government salary.</i>

336
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,708
Yeah, well,
my other suit's made of titanium

337
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:35,250
so this actually constitutes
considerable savings.

338
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,208
<i>We need to meet. ASAP.</i>

339
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:39,792
Great. Tell you what,
let me just finish mopping up

340
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:43,250
this globe-sized bucket of steaming hot
kaka you tipped over yesterday

341
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,250
and then, we can get a drink. Sound good?

342
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:49,292
<i>You sound frustrated.
What's the matter? Croatia talking crap?</i>

343
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,458
Slovakia.

344
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:52,583
<i>Well, carpet-bomb their ass.</i>

345
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,542
Burner's Tavern, one o'clock.

346
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:59,500
Do me a favor and try not to pop off
a nuclear holocaust before you get there.

347
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:32,208
Should I be worried about poison?

348
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:35,417
You should be worried
about spending the rest of your days

349
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,375
in the Siberian retirement community.

350
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,958
Yeah, don't let the relaxed ambiance
fool you.

351
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:42,833
I'm this close to handing your ass
over to the Russians.

352
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:44,958
Forgetting your rank here, Colonel Rhodes?

353
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:47,458
You do not wanna be playing
"mine is bigger than yours"

354
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,292
with job titles right now, Fury.

355
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:52,125
Trust me, I'm the last friend you've got.

356
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,167
Are the Russians
really tryin' to pin this on me?

357
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,417
Your face is all over CCTV footage.

358
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,000
I was there trying to stop the attack.

359
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:03,042
Oh, well, excellent job at that,
by the way. 2,000 dead so far.

360
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,750
Number will probably triple
once they clear all the rubble.

361
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:08,458
Meaning you not only set the stage
for World War III,

362
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:11,792
but you simultaneously flipped
all of our allies to Team Russia.

363
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:24,500
How well do you know your security detail?

364
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,208
I know they're catching bullets first
if I get shot at.

365
00:34:28,292 --> 00:34:31,292
What do you mean
how much do I know about 'em?

366
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:34,417
What if I told you they were all spies?

367
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,125
Spies for who, the Russians?

368
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:40,667
Well... non-state actors.

369
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,042
You know, global reach,
borderless operations.

370
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,083
- HYDRA?
- Yeah.

371
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:51,917
If HYDRA was a bunch of green guys
who could shape-shift into your daddy.

372
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,417
So, how long have you known about them?

373
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:06,708
About 15 years ago,

374
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:10,708
I was part of an eyes-only,
top-secret presentation.

375
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:13,375
It was about
a shape-shifting alien species

376
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:16,250
that had sent a few of its light ships
crashing down to Earth.

377
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,500
The Pentagon was concerned

378
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:22,583
that they might get into their heads
to invade us one day from the inside.

379
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,542
That invasion is real. It's happened.

380
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,542
That's... That's not possible.

381
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,833
Yeah, that's what I thought, too,
but it's true.

382
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:33,625
And here's the crazy part,

383
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:37,542
we're being invaded and we can't even tell
who the invaders are.

384
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,625
Moscow was just the beginning.

385
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:42,875
Maybe we should call our friends.

386
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,458
No, no, no, we can't jump the gun on that.

387
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:48,083
You know, we get them
in a fight with the Skrulls

388
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:49,417
and next thing you know,

389
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,667
they find themselves duplicated
and turned into terrorists.

390
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,875
Fury, this isn't...

391
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:56,292
This is my war, Rhodey.

392
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,167
I need you to back me on this.

393
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:00,333
I... I can't do it.

394
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:01,833
Ain't no "can't" in our business.

395
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:04,667
There's only what you can do
and what you will not do.

396
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,500
You're right.
I should've said, I'm not doing it.

397
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,583
I just spent
all the political capital I had

398
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,917
in getting Maria Hill's body
back from the Russians.

399
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,976
Are you really talking to me
about politics right now?

400
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,167
I'm here as an envoy
of the United States government, Fury.

401
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,375
The job is political.

402
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,958
I remember when your job
was protecting the planet.

403
00:36:21,042 --> 00:36:24,208
We protect the planet
by protecting our seat at the table.

404
00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:26,833
Are you forgetting who helped you
get your seat at the table?

405
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:28,792
Oh, so I owe you now? Is that it?

406
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,000
We owe each other.

407
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:35,458
Men who look like us don't get promoted
because of who our daddies know.

408
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:38,292
Every ounce of power
we wrestle from the vice grip

409
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:44,083
of the mediocre Alexander Pierces
who run this world was earned in blood.

410
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:47,542
So let's make the power mean something.
Help a brother out.

411
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,917
Car's outside, Colonel.

412
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,583
Colonel Rhodes will let you know
when he's ready to go.

413
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:55,167
The car is for you, Fury.

414
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,042
They'll escort you outside,
then you're goin' to the airport.

415
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:01,375
Oh. I'm sorry.
I didn't know I had travel plans.

416
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:03,583
I made 'em on your behalf.

417
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:05,976
Have you even listened
to a word that I've said?

418
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,333
Yeah, I have. The world is on the line.

419
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:12,125
The enemy is a million times
more dangerous than HYDRA,

420
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:14,083
but they can only be vanquished by you.

421
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:15,167
Alone.

422
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,583
And you want me to make the power
mean something by helpin' a brother out.

423
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,167
But you should know better than most.

424
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:24,917
The reason we wrestled this power
from mediocre men who don't look like us

425
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,208
was not simply to turn around
and hand it to mediocre men who do.

426
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:31,500
The point of this power
is to be uncompromising,

427
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,250
to be unsparing,

428
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,542
to be able to sit across
from a man we greatly admire,

429
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:41,833
with whom we share an entire professional,
personal, ancestral history with

430
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:45,292
and to tell him without any reservation,
that he's fired.

431
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:50,125
That's what this moment right here,
right now is about, Nick.

432
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,833
They sent you to fire me?

433
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:06,083
Nobody sent me. I volunteered.

434
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:10,167
And not to put too fine a point on this,
but that mess that you created in Moscow

435
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,958
that resulted in getting
one of our best people murdered,

436
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:15,250
you earned all this smoke, brother.

437
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:23,583
Move.

438
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:26,708
Are you seriously under the impression

439
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:31,042
that just because you strip me
of my titles, I relinquish my DNA?

440
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:32,125
Careful, Fury.

441
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:42,917
And you wonder why you're out.

442
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,083
I'm Nick Fury.

443
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:50,708
Even when I'm out, I'm in.

444
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:27,018
Yes,
and now that the door is unlocked,

445
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:28,833
what does that tell you
about me and doors?

446
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,375
Who are you?

447
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:33,417
I'm above your pay grade. Where is he?

448
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:37,125
Thank you.

449
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:59,500
Where is your safe house?

450
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,463
- Speak!
- Didn't your mother ever warn you

451
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,208
you could lose an eye
by beating your meat like that?

452
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,000
What are you doing here?

453
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:09,625
Oh, I'm taking over.

454
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:40,750
I've thrown everything at him
and he hasn't said a word.

455
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:43,208
What makes you think
you can get him to speak?

456
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:44,875
Oh, I can be quite persuasive.

457
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,292
Oh, before I forget,
where is the escape hatch in this dump?

458
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:49,667
Why do you need to know that?

459
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,750
Oh, just a hunch.

460
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:56,417
Oh, wonderful. Okay, make yourself scarce.

461
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:13,250
What are you looking at?

462
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,667
Alone at last. Now, shall we do this
the easy way or the other way?

463
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,958
I'm gonna break these chains.

464
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:24,917
And then, I'm gonna break
every bone in your body.

465
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,042
The other way it is.

466
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:37,833
Mmm.

467
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:41,792
Well, now that's confirmed,
let's party, shall we?

468
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:07,958
What are you doing in here?

469
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:12,250
Checking the progress
of our newest recruit.

470
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:15,833
He'll be ready for a face before long.

471
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:22,250
He's loyal.

472
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,125
Loyal.

473
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:28,875
You know, I remember
when you first came to me, G'iah.

474
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:32,208
The daughter of a failed General.

475
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:37,583
I thought to myself, what kind of coward
sends his daughter to do what he wouldn't?

476
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:42,458
But you know, then I realized that kind of
coward just doesn't have it in him.

477
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:53,333
Our man on the inside located Brogan.

478
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:58,333
Let's go then.

479
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:02,083
You're wasting your time.
I'll never talk to you.

480
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:03,458
Well, that's very brave,

481
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:07,250
but everyone talks
when their blood starts to cook at 160°C.

482
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:08,958
It's a biochemical imperative.

483
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:11,667
The smart ones
start talking earlier than that.

484
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,083
You a smart one?

485
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:15,750
Right, I didn't think so.

486
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:19,375
Go ahead, put it in my arm. I don't care.

487
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:05,292
Tell me the location
of Gravik's compound.

488
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:08,292
I swear I know nothing. Please!

489
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:11,000
I'm afraid, sorry, dear heart,
I can't work with nothing.

490
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,500
I need to know where Gravik is,
and where he'll be.

491
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:18,917
I don't know, I swear.
Gravik keeps everything a secret.

492
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,167
And what secrets doesn't he keep?

493
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,542
He's building a machine.

494
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:26,833
What kind of machine?

495
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,500
I think it's to make us stronger.

496
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,162
You wait in the car.

497
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,750
- Keep the engine running.
- Mmm-hmm.

498
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:45,792
Who's helping you?

499
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,250
I don't know what you mean.

500
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:51,125
Who's leading the science?

501
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:57,708
Some married couple.

502
00:44:58,833 --> 00:44:59,833
What's their name?

503
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,292
I can't, please. Gravik will kill me.

504
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:08,583
I'm terribly sorry,
but if I don't get a name,

505
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,958
Gravik won't get the chance to kill you.

506
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:15,750
Please.

507
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,500
Dalton.

508
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:21,542
The name's Dalton.

509
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,833
You see,
that wasn't so terribly difficult, was it?

510
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:20,750
Sounds like your lift is here.

511
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:27,417
Listen, I'm just gonna go
and check around back.

512
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:29,375
Cool. I'll come with.

513
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:32,042
No, no, no. You stay here.
They might come out with Brogan.

514
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:34,125
Yeah.

515
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,417
You're a smart lady, G'iah.

516
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:04,750
How very Dostoyevsky.

517
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:44,375
Gotcha.

518
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:47,583
You're all right.

519
00:47:47,667 --> 00:47:49,708
I've got him. Let's go.

520
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,000
What'd you tell 'em?

521
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:00,625
Nothin', just lies.

522
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,250
Nothin'?

523
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:05,750
Just lies?

524
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:07,083
That's all, I swear.

525
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:19,375
Take him to the car.

526
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:44,000
Keep driving.

527
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:49,208
How did they find our safe house?

528
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:13,958
Pull over.

529
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:40,958
Did we make it home, Pagon?

530
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:44,125
Almost there, bro.

531
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:14,833
Aren't you forgetting something?

532
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:34,042
Better?

533
00:52:37,292 --> 00:52:38,500
Almost.

534
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:52,667
<i>All you got to do is, man,
hold her when you wanna</i>

535
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:57,333
<i>Squeeze her, don't tease her,
never leave her</i>

536
00:52:58,167 --> 00:53:04,333
<i>Get to her, got, got, got to try
a little tenderness, yeah, yeah</i>

537
00:53:04,542 --> 00:53:07,500
<i>You got to know how to love her, man</i>

538
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,083
<i>Don't be surprised, man</i>

539
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:14,500
<i>You got to squeeze her,
don't tease her, never leave</i>

540
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:18,750
<i>You got to hold her,
brother, something, man</i>

541
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:22,125
<i>Try a little tenderness
yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

542
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:25,292
<i>You got to grab her gently, man</i>

543
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,083
<i>Don't bruise her, no, no</i>

544
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:33,333
<i>You got to love her, tease her,
don't squeeze her</i>

545
00:53:33,417 --> 00:53:35,792
<i>You got to try, na na na na na</i>

546
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:39,667
<i>Try, try a little tenderness, yeah</i>

547
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,750
<i>Watch her groove</i>

548
00:53:41,292 --> 00:53:44,292
<i>You got to know what to do, man</i>

549
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:45,708
<i>Take this advice</i>

550
00:53:45,792 --> 00:53:49,750
<i>You gotta love, squeeze, don't tease</i>
