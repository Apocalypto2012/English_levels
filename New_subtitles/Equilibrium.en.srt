1
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,873
In the first years
of the 21st century...

2
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,091
...a third World War broke out.

3
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,381
Those of us who survived knew

4
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:57,612
mankind could never survive...

5
00:00:57,688 --> 00:01:00,175
a fourth...

6
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:03,695
that our own volatile natures

7
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:07,859
could simply no longer
be risked.

8
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:12,750
So we have created
a new arm of the law...

9
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:17,559
...the Grammaton Cleric,

10
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:22,293
whose sole task it is
to seek out and eradicate

11
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,445
the true source
of man's inhumanity to man.

12
00:01:29,943 --> 00:01:33,653
His ability...

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,575
to feel.

14
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,710
Police!

15
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:54,038
You know what to do.

16
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:09,678
Get down!

17
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,367
We have an unknown number

18
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,775
barricaded in the southeast end
of the compound.

19
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,174
Read that.
Tetragrammaton team en route.

20
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,102
Cleric, lights out.
Maybe more than a dozen inside.

21
00:03:05,176 --> 00:03:07,478
When the door's down,
blow the bulbs.

22
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:09,268
Yes, sir.

23
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:14,253
Go.

24
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:01,584
Where is he?

25
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:02,769
Shut up.

26
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:05,687
Anybody get him?
Did anybody hit him?

27
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:07,127
Shut up!

28
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:08,621
Listen.

29
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:04,304
This is it.

30
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:05,489
Where?

31
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:08,910
There.

32
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,829
It's real.

33
00:06:53,785 --> 00:06:55,214
Burn it.

34
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:35,096
Why didn't you just leave it

35
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:38,128
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

36
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:44,690
They miss things sometimes.

37
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:49,591
And I thought
I'd take it down myself...

38
00:07:49,657 --> 00:07:51,086
get it done properly.

39
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:59,438
How long, Preston,
till all this is gone?

40
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:03,667
Till we've burned
every last bit of it?

41
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,926
Resources are tight.

42
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:10,832
We'll get it all eventually.

43
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:18,388
Libria...

44
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,588
I congratulate you.

45
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:23,512
At last...

46
00:08:23,577 --> 00:08:28,149
peace reigns
in the heart of man.

47
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,868
At last, war is but a word

48
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:34,068
whose meaning fades
from our understanding.

49
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:36,309
At last...

50
00:08:36,378 --> 00:08:40,371
we... are... whole.

51
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:52,214
Librians... there is a disease
in the heart of man.

52
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,638
Its symptom is hate.

53
00:08:56,825 --> 00:09:00,884
Its symptom... is anger.

54
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:04,881
Its symptom is rage.

55
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:09,688
Its symptom... is war.

56
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:16,464
The disease... is human emotion.

57
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:20,466
But, Libria...
I congratulate you.

58
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:22,839
For there is a cure
for this disease.

59
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:26,201
At the cost of the dizzying
highs of human emotion,

60
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:30,226
we have suppressed
its abysmal lows.

61
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:35,600
And you as a society
have embraced this cure.

62
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:37,848
Prozium.

63
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:42,488
Now we are at peace
with ourselves,

64
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:45,849
and humankind is one.

65
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:47,768
War is gone.

66
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,353
Hate, a memory.

67
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:53,208
We are our own conscience now.

68
00:09:53,274 --> 00:09:58,511
And it is this conscience
that guides us to rate EC-10

69
00:09:58,585 --> 00:10:00,690
for emotional content

70
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:04,755
all those things that might
tempt us to feel again...

71
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:06,386
and destroy them.

72
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,327
Librians, you have won.

73
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:14,071
Against all odds
and your own natures...

74
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:18,328
you have survived.

75
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:40,590
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

76
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,015
it reminds why we do
what we do.

77
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,170
It does?

78
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:48,917
I beg your pardon.

79
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,962
It <i>does</i>.

80
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:10,582
The following items
have been rated EC-10--

81
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,991
condemned--

82
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:14,807
seven works of two-dimensional
illustrated material,

83
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,362
seven discs of musical content,

84
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:20,336
20 interactive strategy
computer programs.

85
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,225
Seven works
of two-dimensional...

86
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,324
Thank you
for coming, Cleric.

87
00:11:30,393 --> 00:11:32,248
I assume you know who I am.

88
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:33,524
Yes, sir. Of course.

89
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:35,120
You are Vice-Council Dupont

90
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:37,365
of the Third Conciliarly
of the Tetragrammaton--

91
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:38,808
Father's voice.

92
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:40,466
Quite frankly, Cleric,

93
00:11:40,537 --> 00:11:45,076
I am told that you are
very nearly a prodigal student,

94
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:48,888
knowing almost instantly
if someone is feeling.

95
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:50,645
I have a good record, sir.

96
00:11:50,714 --> 00:11:53,332
Why, do you imagine,
that is, Cleric?

97
00:11:53,402 --> 00:11:55,791
I'm not sure, Vice-Council.

98
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:59,831
Somehow...

99
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:02,264
I'm able, on some level,

100
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,745
to sense
how an offender thinks,

101
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:09,527
to... put myself
in their position.

102
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:14,608
If you had ceased
your interval,

103
00:12:14,682 --> 00:12:17,998
if you were
a sense offender...

104
00:12:18,073 --> 00:12:20,081
I suppose
you could say that, sir.

105
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:22,390
You're a family man, Cleric?

106
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,084
Yes, sir--
a boy and a girl.

107
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:26,041
The boy's in
the monastery himself,

108
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:27,480
on path to becoming a Cleric.

109
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,560
Good.

110
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:29,811
And the mother?

111
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,605
My spouse was arrested
and incinerated

112
00:12:31,673 --> 00:12:33,364
for sense offense
four years ago, sir.

113
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:34,361
By yourself?

114
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:35,604
No, sir-- by another.

115
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:39,662
How did you feel about that?

116
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,602
I'm sorry.

117
00:12:43,674 --> 00:12:45,746
I don't...
fully understand, sir.

118
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,626
How did you feel?

119
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:53,039
I didn't feel anything.

120
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:54,805
Really?

121
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,175
How is it
that you came to miss it?

122
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,830
I...

123
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:09,016
I've asked myself
that same question, sir.

124
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:10,544
I don't know.

125
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:15,254
A nearly unforgivable lapse,
Cleric.

126
00:13:16,858 --> 00:13:21,364
I trust you'll be
more vigilant in the future.

127
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:24,692
Yes, sir.

128
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:31,412
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

129
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:34,068
it reminds why we do
what we do.

130
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:35,153
It does?

131
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:38,672
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

132
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:41,877
it reminds why we do
what we do.

133
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:42,928
It does?

134
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:46,810
It <i>does</i>.

135
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:53,749
Prosecutorial evidence
for A.N.R. 136890.

136
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:55,345
I need it.

137
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,273
It was late this afternoon.

138
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:59,477
May not have showed up
in the records yet.

139
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,068
I'm very sorry, Cleric.

140
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:03,513
Nothing has been logged

141
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,912
and nothing is pending
under that entry.

142
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,986
It was an item of evidence
brought in personally

143
00:14:08,058 --> 00:14:09,269
by Grammaton Errol Partridge.

144
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:10,548
Check again.

145
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:14,742
Sir, Cleric Partridge has not
entered anything in for weeks.

146
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,712
You're mistaken.
It was a book of some kind.

147
00:14:17,786 --> 00:14:18,768
Cleric...

148
00:14:21,114 --> 00:14:22,390
...there's nothing.

149
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:25,487
Thank you.

150
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:31,538
He's been passing through
the gate into the Nether

151
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,951
every night
for the last two weeks.

152
00:14:33,018 --> 00:14:34,512
We assumed it was
enforcement-related.

153
00:15:16,378 --> 00:15:18,450
You always knew.

154
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:30,483
"But I, being poor...

155
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,791
have only my dreams."

156
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:37,015
"I have spread my dreams
under your feet.

157
00:15:37,082 --> 00:15:40,213
"Tread softly...

158
00:15:40,282 --> 00:15:43,479
because you tread
on my dreams."

159
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:47,415
I assume you dream, Preston.

160
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:51,410
I'll do what I can
to see they go easy on you.

161
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:58,071
We both know...
they never go easy.

162
00:15:58,138 --> 00:15:59,284
Then I'm sorry.

163
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:01,242
No, you're not.

164
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:04,306
You don't even know
the meaning.

165
00:16:04,378 --> 00:16:06,898
It's just a... vestigial word

166
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,793
for a feeling
you've never felt.

167
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:13,367
Don't you see, Preston?

168
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:15,442
It's gone.

169
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:18,613
Everything that makes us
what we are-- traded away.

170
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:20,755
There's no war.

171
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:23,382
No murder.

172
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,549
What is it you think we do?

173
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,374
No.

174
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:29,686
You've been with me.

175
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:32,983
You've seen how it can be--
the jealousy, the rage.

176
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:36,976
A heavy cost.

177
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,363
I'd pay it gladly.

178
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,263
Don't.

179
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:49,042
You and your partner
were close?

180
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,882
I hope you're as pleased
to be assigned me

181
00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:58,711
as I am the placement.

182
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,408
I was told this would be
a career-making advancement.

183
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:11,152
I'm like you, Cleric--
intuitive.

184
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:14,386
Sometimes I know
when a person's feeling

185
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:16,215
before they know it
themselves.

186
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:28,209
Cleric...

187
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:31,859
I can only hope one day
to be as...

188
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:35,760
uncompromising as you.

189
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:37,112
Good night.

190
00:18:39,707 --> 00:18:41,714
The later 20th century

191
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,787
saw the fortuitous
and simultaneous rise

192
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:49,747
of two synergistic political
and psychological sciences.

193
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:53,747
The first, the revolutionary
precept of the hate crime.

194
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,299
John?

195
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:58,319
Yes?

196
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:01,395
I saw Robbie Taylor
crying today.

197
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:05,012
He didn't know, but I saw.

198
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,320
Do you think
I should report him?

199
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,615
Unquestionably.

200
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:23,158
...a single inescapable fact--

201
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:26,129
that mankind united with
infinitely greater purpose

202
00:19:26,235 --> 00:19:28,723
in pursuit of war...

203
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:32,406
than he ever did
in pursuit of peace.

204
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:43,282
"But I, being poor...

205
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:46,006
have only my dreams."

206
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:49,271
I have spread my dreams
under your feet."

207
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:52,950
"Tread softly...

208
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:55,736
because you tread
on my dreams."

209
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:38,933
Don't move! Don't move!

210
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,531
Comply! Comply!

211
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:42,459
- Stop! Stop where you are!
- Get down! Get down!

212
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,883
Don't shoot.
This is a lawful entry.

213
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,385
We have a warrant
for your wife's arrest.

214
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,216
She's charged
with sense offense.

215
00:21:04,668 --> 00:21:05,879
Hey!

216
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:08,665
Get her!
Get her off him now!

217
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:11,064
Remember me.

218
00:21:24,028 --> 00:21:25,970
Libria...

219
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:27,735
Awake.

220
00:21:27,804 --> 00:21:32,790
Awaken to triumph again
in the face of yet another day,

221
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,276
another step
in our unified march

222
00:21:36,348 --> 00:21:39,796
into the unwavering purpose...

223
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,230
...move ahead together

224
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,748
into the certainty
of our collective destiny.

225
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:11,224
What are you doing?

226
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,599
I said, what are you doing?

227
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,985
I accidently dropped my...

228
00:22:20,061 --> 00:22:21,555
morning interval.

229
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:24,497
I took it out
before I brushed my teeth.

230
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:27,930
I never take it out
before I brush my teeth.

231
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:31,738
Then you'll go by Equilibrium,
log the loss,

232
00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:33,081
and get a replacement.

233
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:35,963
Yes.

234
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:37,719
Of course.

235
00:22:57,564 --> 00:22:59,735
Your new partner called.

236
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:02,074
He says he'll pick you up
at 10:00 for the A.N.R.

237
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:03,417
I hope you don't mind.

238
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:05,721
I took the liberty
of telling him

239
00:23:05,788 --> 00:23:08,755
you would be at Equilibrium,
replacing your dose.

240
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,250
No, of course not.

241
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:13,179
That was the right thing
to do.

242
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,329
Stop that.

243
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:27,799
Due to terrorist activity,

244
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:30,202
this site is
temporarily closed.

245
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:35,484
Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.

246
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:38,807
Due to terrorist activity,

247
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:41,081
this site is
temporarily closed.

248
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:43,483
This site is
temporarily closed.

249
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:47,826
Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.

250
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:54,327
More than punctual, Cleric.

251
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:55,509
Hop in.

252
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,655
How were the lines?

253
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:12,059
I'm surprised you were able
to get your interval

254
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,718
and get out so quickly.

255
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:16,883
No, they're...
they're fine today.

256
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:23,800
Maybe I'll drop by later,
get my interval adjusted.

257
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:27,414
You expecting Resistance?

258
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:30,551
That's something you'll find
about me, Cleric.

259
00:24:30,621 --> 00:24:34,483
I'm a wary person,
cautious by nature.

260
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:38,010
Always expecting the worst.

261
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:41,593
You can't do this.
You cannot do this.

262
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:44,596
Tetragrammaton.
There's nothing we can't do.

263
00:24:45,821 --> 00:24:47,676
How long have you been off
the dose?

264
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:48,788
Look at you.

265
00:24:49,949 --> 00:24:51,476
Look at you!

266
00:24:58,204 --> 00:24:59,317
Look at you.

267
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:03,891
The mirror's frame is illegal.
Destroy it.

268
00:25:12,413 --> 00:25:15,130
We have suppression.
We're making entry.

269
00:25:15,197 --> 00:25:16,571
Standard deployment.

270
00:25:16,637 --> 00:25:19,321
Collecting catalog.
Illegal articles.

271
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:05,208
You're gonna burn it,
aren't you?

272
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:07,804
Eventually.

273
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:10,455
However, you couldn't have
accumulated all this

274
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:11,735
by yourself.

275
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:14,675
It'll all be sorted
and examined.

276
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:17,748
We'll discover
who your confederates are.

277
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:20,307
Gun!

278
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:38,934
We need her.

279
00:27:04,062 --> 00:27:05,010
What's your name?

280
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:08,151
O'Brien, Mary.

281
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:11,320
Well, Mary...

282
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:12,731
you can either wait

283
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,726
and tell the technicians
at the Palace of Justice...

284
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:19,448
or you can tell me now.

285
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:21,427
Who are your friends?

286
00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:27,411
I'm wondering if you have
any idea at all

287
00:27:27,485 --> 00:27:30,387
what that word means--
"friend."

288
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:35,702
There's nothing
you don't feel?

289
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:38,771
How about guilt?

290
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,647
Let me ask you something.

291
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,687
Why are you alive?

292
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:59,187
I'm alive...

293
00:28:03,358 --> 00:28:04,634
I live...

294
00:28:07,037 --> 00:28:10,354
...to safeguard the continuity
of this great society.

295
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,956
To serve Libria.

296
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:13,404
It's circular.

297
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,957
You exist to continue
your existence.

298
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,458
What's the point?

299
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:21,240
What's the point
of <i>your</i> existence?

300
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,771
To feel.

301
00:28:22,845 --> 00:28:25,879
'Cause you've never done it,
you can never know it.

302
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,601
But it's as vital as breath.

303
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,190
And without it--
without love,

304
00:28:31,262 --> 00:28:34,611
without anger,
without sorrow--

305
00:28:34,686 --> 00:28:38,876
breath is
just a clock ticking.

306
00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:45,626
Then I have no choice
but to remand you

307
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:47,832
to the Palace of Justice
for processing.

308
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:51,097
Processing.

309
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:56,214
You mean execution, don't you?

310
00:28:58,526 --> 00:29:00,119
Processing.

311
00:29:07,774 --> 00:29:09,596
The Gun Katas.

312
00:29:09,662 --> 00:29:12,477
Through analysis of thousands
of recorded gunfights,

313
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,364
the Cleric has determined

314
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,496
that the geometric distribution
of antagonists in any gun battle

315
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:20,119
is a statistically
predictable element.

316
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,486
The Gun Kata treats
the gun as a total weapon,

317
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,721
each fluid position
representing

318
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,692
a maximum kill zone,
inflicting maximum damage

319
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,555
on the maximum number
of opponents

320
00:29:30,622 --> 00:29:32,280
while keeping
the defender clear

321
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,521
of the statistically
traditional trajectories

322
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,183
of return fire.

323
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,165
By the rote mastery
of this art,

324
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,329
your firing efficiency will rise
by no less than 120%.

325
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:45,813
The difference of a 63% increase
to lethal proficiency

326
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:48,155
makes the master
of the Gun Katas

327
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:51,965
an adversary not to be
taken lightly.

328
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,968
Without love...

329
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,454
breath is just a clock...
ticking.

330
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:27,412
Prozium--
the great nepenthe.

331
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,592
Opiate of our masses.

332
00:32:29,663 --> 00:32:32,151
Glue of our great society.

333
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:34,230
Salve and salvation,

334
00:32:34,303 --> 00:32:38,078
it has delivered us
from pathos, from sorrow,

335
00:32:38,143 --> 00:32:42,038
the deepest chasms
of melancholy and hate.

336
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:44,532
With it, we anesthetize grief,

337
00:32:44,607 --> 00:32:48,535
annihilate jealousy,
obliterate rage.

338
00:32:48,607 --> 00:32:52,862
That those sister impulses
towards joy, love, and elation

339
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:55,382
are anesthetized in stride,

340
00:32:55,455 --> 00:32:57,659
we accept as fair sacrifice.

341
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:03,444
For we embrace Prozium
in its unifying fullness

342
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,578
and all that it has done
to make us great.

343
00:33:58,431 --> 00:33:59,773
Good morning, Cleric.

344
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,694
Good morning.

345
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,654
...intrinsically, humans,
as creatures of the Earth

346
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:11,706
were drawn inherently always
back to one thing-- war.

347
00:34:11,776 --> 00:34:14,939
And thus we seek to correct
not the symptom

348
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:17,463
but the disease itself.

349
00:34:17,536 --> 00:34:20,852
We have sought to shrug off
individuality,

350
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:23,448
replacing it with conformity.

351
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,301
Replacing it...

352
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:28,986
with sameness...

353
00:34:29,056 --> 00:34:31,445
with unity,

354
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:35,895
allowing each man, woman,
and child

355
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:37,723
in this great society

356
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:41,207
to lead identical lives.

357
00:34:42,687 --> 00:34:46,036
The concept of identical
environment construction

358
00:34:46,111 --> 00:34:49,242
allows each of us to head
confidently into each moment

359
00:34:49,312 --> 00:34:50,970
with all the secure knowledge

360
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,757
it has been lived before.

361
00:35:07,968 --> 00:35:09,561
What are you doing?

362
00:35:13,216 --> 00:35:15,103
I'm rearranging my desk.

363
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:17,720
You didn't like
the way it was before?

364
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:20,789
I had no feelings about it.

365
00:35:20,863 --> 00:35:22,968
I'm merely attempting
to optimize.

366
00:35:25,888 --> 00:35:29,597
Sense offenders
holed up in the Nether.

367
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:45,981
We estimate--
we estimate 50 men, sir.

368
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,495
Intelligence tells us
they're all fully armed.

369
00:35:49,568 --> 00:35:53,049
This is the group that bombed
the Prozium factories.

370
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,581
You clean, we'll sweep.

371
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:56,118
Yes, sir.

372
00:35:59,008 --> 00:36:00,797
Go! Go! Go! Go!

373
00:36:00,864 --> 00:36:01,758
Go!

374
00:36:01,824 --> 00:36:03,351
Aah!

375
00:36:03,424 --> 00:36:05,725
Take it! Take the landings!

376
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,829
- Aah!
- Aah!

377
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:20,888
- Cover me. I'm going in.
- Aaaaaaaah!

378
00:36:24,608 --> 00:36:26,037
Nice grab, Cleric.

379
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:53,343
"Ludwig Van Beethoven."

380
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:48,282
Cleric...

381
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:50,710
Why didn't you leave that

382
00:40:50,785 --> 00:40:53,436
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

383
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:00,704
They miss things sometimes.

384
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,770
I'll take it in myself...

385
00:41:03,842 --> 00:41:06,525
make sure
it gets done properly.

386
00:41:09,506 --> 00:41:11,415
You know, Preston...

387
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,162
If we keep burning
all this contraband,

388
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:17,372
eventually there won't be
anything left to burn.

389
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:21,086
What'll there be
for men like us?

390
00:41:21,153 --> 00:41:22,779
Sir!

391
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,344
We got something out back.

392
00:41:33,506 --> 00:41:35,775
We're gonna need
two more men on this.

393
00:41:40,993 --> 00:41:43,229
These animals were defended
by women and children.

394
00:41:43,298 --> 00:41:44,541
We put them down easily.

395
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:48,090
This isn't the first time
we've seen this.

396
00:41:48,162 --> 00:41:50,333
Why do they keep
these animals?

397
00:41:50,401 --> 00:41:52,441
What, do they--
do they eat them?

398
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,410
What do you want me
to do, sir?

399
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:57,725
Exterminate them, of course.

400
00:41:57,794 --> 00:41:59,168
All right. Let's do it.

401
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:00,924
No.

402
00:42:00,994 --> 00:42:02,139
What's wrong, Cleric?

403
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:07,675
Nothing.

404
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:21,590
Hey...

405
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:22,843
Grab it.

406
00:42:22,914 --> 00:42:23,961
Grab it!

407
00:42:31,394 --> 00:42:33,499
Sir... toss it back in.

408
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,326
I'll finish it off.

409
00:42:40,034 --> 00:42:41,016
Give it to me, sir.

410
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,944
Give it to him, Cleric.
He'll finish it.

411
00:42:56,354 --> 00:42:57,564
Wait!

412
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,905
It seems to me that...

413
00:43:02,978 --> 00:43:06,491
at least some of these animals
ought to be tested for disease.

414
00:43:06,562 --> 00:43:08,504
If there's an epidemic
in the Nether,

415
00:43:08,578 --> 00:43:10,945
it's best we know about it.

416
00:43:13,826 --> 00:43:17,437
I don't quite follow
your logic, Cleric.

417
00:43:17,505 --> 00:43:18,716
They were Resistance.

418
00:43:18,785 --> 00:43:20,924
They could have led us
to the Underground.

419
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:22,587
But instead of apprehension
and interrogation,

420
00:43:22,657 --> 00:43:23,585
they were slaughtered.

421
00:43:23,649 --> 00:43:26,683
Yes, but, Cleric,
given the circumstances,

422
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:28,280
the Father has decreed

423
00:43:28,353 --> 00:43:31,615
that there will be no more
"process" for sense offenders.

424
00:43:31,681 --> 00:43:33,983
They are either to be
shot on sight

425
00:43:34,049 --> 00:43:35,478
or incinerated without a trial.

426
00:43:35,553 --> 00:43:36,633
But it's counter to law.

427
00:43:36,706 --> 00:43:38,462
You're a member
of the Council. If--

428
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,318
It is not the will
of the Council,

429
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:43,036
it is the will of Father--
and he is law.

430
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:46,998
Sir...

431
00:43:47,073 --> 00:43:49,888
without the logic of process,
is it not just mayhem--

432
00:43:49,953 --> 00:43:52,822
what we have worked so hard
to eradicate?

433
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:54,937
You must understand, Preston,

434
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:58,457
that while you-- and even I--
may not always agree with it,

435
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,115
it is not the message
that is important,

436
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:04,284
it is our obedience to it.

437
00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:06,393
Father's will.

438
00:44:06,466 --> 00:44:08,953
Call it faith.

439
00:44:09,025 --> 00:44:10,967
You have it, I assume?

440
00:44:15,393 --> 00:44:16,670
Yes.

441
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,607
I have it.

442
00:44:19,681 --> 00:44:21,176
Good.

443
00:44:41,665 --> 00:44:44,862
Confiscated evidence
X23-T45--

444
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:47,198
Mary O'Brien.

445
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,793
Cleric John Preston
passing into the Nether--

446
00:45:48,866 --> 00:45:50,938
enforcement-related.

447
00:45:53,826 --> 00:45:55,004
Thank you, sir.

448
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:28,155
I don't know what else
to do with you.

449
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:33,110
Go on.

450
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,373
Go!

451
00:47:11,426 --> 00:47:12,506
Fine.

452
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,521
But you're going back
in the trunk.

453
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,272
Okay.

454
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,661
Here.

455
00:47:44,578 --> 00:47:48,573
Step away from the vehicle!

456
00:47:48,643 --> 00:47:49,887
This is your last warning!

457
00:47:49,955 --> 00:47:52,672
Step away from the vehicle!

458
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:54,844
Identification.

459
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,289
I'm a Cleric.

460
00:47:56,354 --> 00:47:58,460
I'm here on official business.

461
00:47:58,531 --> 00:47:59,261
Identification!

462
00:48:00,515 --> 00:48:01,562
It's in my coat.

463
00:48:01,635 --> 00:48:03,774
Where's the coat?
Where is it?!

464
00:48:04,994 --> 00:48:06,969
I don't have it.

465
00:48:07,043 --> 00:48:09,661
Unidentified individuals are
subject to summary destruction.

466
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,323
You're making
a very big mistake.

467
00:48:11,394 --> 00:48:12,409
I'm a Grammaton Cleric,
first class.

468
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,463
We're gonna search
your vehicle.

469
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:15,710
No, you're not.
There's nothing in it.

470
00:48:15,779 --> 00:48:17,186
Search it!

471
00:48:23,747 --> 00:48:25,601
- Clear, sir.
- Keys to the trunk.

472
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:26,877
I'm trying to tell you.

473
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:28,922
I have a predawn combustion
to witness.

474
00:48:28,995 --> 00:48:30,369
I'm not--

475
00:48:30,435 --> 00:48:32,322
Captain, this is a waste
of my time.

476
00:48:32,387 --> 00:48:33,663
My name is John Preston.

477
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,967
I'm the highest-ranking Cleric
of the Tetragramm--

478
00:48:36,035 --> 00:48:37,562
Wait.

479
00:48:40,995 --> 00:48:42,010
Stand off.

480
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:47,041
I'm sorry
I didn't recognize you, sir.

481
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:51,390
That's okay.
Just doing your job.

482
00:48:51,459 --> 00:48:52,408
Thank you.

483
00:48:53,634 --> 00:48:55,227
We'll escort you back
to the gate.

484
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,193
Thanks.

485
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,285
Animals.

486
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:07,073
Nether's full of them.

487
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:08,961
Sounds like it came
from your trunk.

488
00:49:09,027 --> 00:49:10,882
Impossible.

489
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,802
Just give me my keys.

490
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:13,947
I'll be on my way.

491
00:49:19,395 --> 00:49:20,606
Captain...

492
00:49:20,675 --> 00:49:23,675
I'm asking you
one last time--

493
00:49:23,746 --> 00:49:25,470
don't do this.

494
00:49:26,947 --> 00:49:28,157
Down on your knees!

495
00:49:28,227 --> 00:49:29,754
- Down on your knees!
- Down on your knees!

496
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:30,972
Drop down!

497
00:49:31,043 --> 00:49:33,214
On the ground! Comply!

498
00:49:33,283 --> 00:49:34,810
Do it!

499
00:49:35,523 --> 00:49:36,570
No.

500
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:37,919
Fuck!

501
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:43,456
What?

502
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:45,727
Aw, shit! Shoot him!
Shoot him! Shoot him!

503
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:55,804
Aah!

504
00:52:08,483 --> 00:52:10,905
Always practicing, Cleric.

505
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,533
I guess that's why
you're the best.

506
00:52:16,515 --> 00:52:18,042
Maybe I'm just better.

507
00:52:19,043 --> 00:52:20,800
Something on your mind?

508
00:52:23,364 --> 00:52:24,640
Why do you ask?

509
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:25,918
The intuitive arts, Cleric.

510
00:52:25,988 --> 00:52:27,995
It's my job to know
what you're thinking.

511
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:41,469
So, then...
what am I thinking?

512
00:52:46,244 --> 00:52:49,179
About the murders
in the Nether last night...

513
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:56,958
And if they know who did it.

514
00:53:02,531 --> 00:53:03,513
Am I close?

515
00:53:06,275 --> 00:53:08,642
So, tell me... do they know?

516
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:18,720
There are theories.

517
00:53:18,788 --> 00:53:20,992
I have one or two of my own,
but at the moment...

518
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,165
they're premature!

519
00:53:27,748 --> 00:53:29,057
I'm glad it happened.

520
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,267
Why?

521
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,315
Because now
Father and the Council

522
00:53:36,388 --> 00:53:39,770
have decreed an acceleration
in the crackdown on offenders.

523
00:53:39,844 --> 00:53:41,949
Whoever did it--

524
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:45,249
all they accomplished was
a quicker end to the Resistance.

525
00:53:54,308 --> 00:53:55,999
It's gonna be
a massacre, Cleric.

526
00:54:12,068 --> 00:54:15,134
I came to tell you...
there's a raid in the Nether--

527
00:54:15,204 --> 00:54:18,106
Sector 7.

528
00:54:19,588 --> 00:54:21,595
So get ready.

529
00:55:01,284 --> 00:55:02,593
That door behind you...

530
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,889
Go.

531
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,769
Go, damn you!

532
00:55:12,996 --> 00:55:14,589
Get out of here, God damn it!
If you don't, you're dead!

533
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,416
Don't do it.
He'll shoot us in the back.

534
00:55:16,484 --> 00:55:18,371
If I was gonna shoot you,
I'd shoot you in the face.

535
00:55:18,437 --> 00:55:19,746
Now go.

536
00:55:25,668 --> 00:55:27,424
Damn you! Follow me.

537
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:30,078
Now! Let's go!

538
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:40,250
There will be no detention.

539
00:55:40,324 --> 00:55:43,968
Repeat--
no detention for any purpose.

540
00:55:44,036 --> 00:55:47,681
All prisoners and apprehendees
are to be put down.

541
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,987
Look out!

542
00:55:59,684 --> 00:56:01,245
Aah!

543
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:04,642
Aaaah!

544
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:11,169
Cleric, what's happening?
We heard gunshots.

545
00:56:12,676 --> 00:56:13,625
Go!

546
00:56:13,701 --> 00:56:15,839
What are you doing?
Cleric!

547
00:56:15,908 --> 00:56:17,119
They're Resistance fighters.

548
00:56:18,116 --> 00:56:19,065
Cleric!

549
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:22,908
He's a sense offender!

550
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:06,530
Cover all quadrants!

551
00:57:06,597 --> 00:57:07,873
Secure the perimeter!

552
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:19,876
What is this?

553
00:57:20,997 --> 00:57:22,720
What are you doing?!

554
00:57:22,788 --> 00:57:25,243
Nicely done, Cleric.

555
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,291
You drive them
into the trap...

556
00:57:29,221 --> 00:57:30,366
I close it.

557
00:57:36,293 --> 00:57:41,082
The very definition
of... teamwork.

558
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:42,618
Don't you think?

559
00:57:44,997 --> 00:57:47,997
Why don't you take the honors
of the execution, Cleric?

560
00:57:51,588 --> 00:57:54,622
These people should be taken
for clinical interrogation.

561
00:57:54,693 --> 00:57:55,805
Cleric...

562
00:57:55,877 --> 00:57:58,081
Father's rulings
are quite clear.

563
00:57:58,149 --> 00:58:00,800
Offenders are to be shot
on sight.

564
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:02,363
They have valuable information.

565
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,419
Cleric...

566
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:04,922
They can be put to
much better use.

567
00:58:04,997 --> 00:58:05,924
Cleric.

568
00:58:07,205 --> 00:58:10,849
If your weapon's low,
please, use mine.

569
00:58:58,053 --> 00:58:58,719
No.

570
00:59:01,893 --> 00:59:04,282
I think, in the end...

571
00:59:04,357 --> 00:59:06,332
it'll be better
if <i>you</i> have it.

572
00:59:27,653 --> 00:59:28,602
Captain.

573
00:59:28,677 --> 00:59:30,587
Yes, sir. Firing positions.

574
00:59:34,662 --> 00:59:35,872
Ready...

575
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:45,285
Aim...

576
00:59:51,782 --> 00:59:53,505
Fire!

577
00:59:59,941 --> 01:00:01,665
Sir?

578
01:00:01,734 --> 01:00:03,490
Yes, Cleric?

579
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,241
You asked me to become
Father's instrument

580
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:08,895
against the Resistance.

581
01:00:08,966 --> 01:00:10,821
I'm ready.

582
01:00:10,886 --> 01:00:12,741
Today.

583
01:00:12,806 --> 01:00:14,529
I wish to show my faith.

584
01:00:16,549 --> 01:00:18,338
I wish, with your permission,

585
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,188
to locate the Underground
once and for all.

586
01:00:21,253 --> 01:00:22,660
To destroy it.

587
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:26,844
To destroy it.

588
01:00:26,917 --> 01:00:28,924
Good. Do it.

589
01:00:37,959 --> 01:00:40,828
I'm so...

590
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:42,593
so very sorry.

591
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:56,930
These are the possessions he had
on him at the time of death.

592
01:00:56,999 --> 01:00:58,340
The illegal ones
will be burned with him.

593
01:00:58,406 --> 01:00:59,650
Good.

594
01:01:39,526 --> 01:01:40,803
Errol Partridge.

595
01:01:44,614 --> 01:01:46,818
The name supposed to mean
something to me?

596
01:01:46,886 --> 01:01:49,537
He was a Grammaton Cleric,
first class. You knew him.

597
01:01:49,607 --> 01:01:52,738
News bulletin--
I'm a sense offender.

598
01:01:52,806 --> 01:01:54,879
I don't hang around much
with the Cleric.

599
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,293
I want to know about him.

600
01:02:06,438 --> 01:02:07,649
Well...

601
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:10,686
I suggest you go ask him.

602
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,598
But I understand
that he's dead--

603
01:02:14,663 --> 01:02:18,143
killed by your friends
at the Tetragrammaton.

604
01:02:18,214 --> 01:02:20,800
Not by my friends.

605
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:22,464
<i>By me</i>.

606
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,412
Aaah!

607
01:03:05,223 --> 01:03:06,630
You were lovers.

608
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:26,494
The Underground is our foe,

609
01:03:26,567 --> 01:03:29,023
and greater
than even the threat

610
01:03:29,095 --> 01:03:32,805
of those who have forsaken
their Prozium for emotion

611
01:03:32,871 --> 01:03:37,759
is the threat of those
selfsame individuals united.

612
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:40,482
They are
the secret organization...

613
01:03:45,799 --> 01:03:48,614
And thus, it is in the writing
of the Father

614
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:50,370
that we find our greatest--

615
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:53,956
Good afternoon, sir.

616
01:03:54,023 --> 01:03:56,805
What will it be for you?

617
01:03:56,871 --> 01:03:58,529
The latest copy
of the inserts?

618
01:03:58,598 --> 01:04:00,671
Revised edition
of the manifesto?

619
01:04:00,743 --> 01:04:01,725
Errol Partridge.

620
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:04,254
What do you know about him?

621
01:04:04,327 --> 01:04:05,603
I beg your pardon?

622
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,459
Everyone out. Now.

623
01:04:20,743 --> 01:04:22,598
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

624
01:04:22,663 --> 01:04:25,183
Errol Partridge--
what do you know about him?

625
01:04:25,255 --> 01:04:28,005
I'm sure this must be
some mis--

626
01:04:28,071 --> 01:04:30,242
- You're an offender.
- I'm not.

627
01:04:30,311 --> 01:04:33,061
No? Then why are you
so scared of me?

628
01:04:33,127 --> 01:04:36,062
Now, you will tell me everything
you know about Errol Partridge,

629
01:04:36,135 --> 01:04:37,989
or I will have a wagon
come to take you

630
01:04:38,055 --> 01:04:40,772
to the Hall of Destruction
for summary combustion.

631
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:42,879
I-I really don't know--

632
01:04:42,951 --> 01:04:43,999
Speak!

633
01:04:44,103 --> 01:04:47,518
He-- he'd come in here
with a fellow named Jurgen.

634
01:04:47,591 --> 01:04:48,802
Why?

635
01:04:48,871 --> 01:04:51,838
That's-- that's all I know.
I swear.

636
01:04:51,911 --> 01:04:52,859
Jurgen!

637
01:05:12,743 --> 01:05:14,467
Interesting.

638
01:05:16,231 --> 01:05:17,540
- Ugh-ow!
- Ugh!

639
01:05:50,952 --> 01:05:53,886
We've been watching you,
Preston.

640
01:05:59,848 --> 01:06:01,092
You're Jurgen.

641
01:06:02,632 --> 01:06:05,250
You're feeling.

642
01:06:19,048 --> 01:06:21,055
Do you know why you came?

643
01:06:42,823 --> 01:06:45,311
Welcome to the Underground.

644
01:06:55,368 --> 01:06:56,829
Polygraph.

645
01:06:56,903 --> 01:07:00,678
It detects fluctuations
of human emotion.

646
01:07:00,743 --> 01:07:02,816
We have to be sure.

647
01:07:07,752 --> 01:07:09,181
Mary.

648
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:17,504
You're carrying
in your left pocket

649
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:20,390
a red ribbon
sprayed with her scent.

650
01:07:22,567 --> 01:07:24,356
You breathe it in sometimes

651
01:07:24,424 --> 01:07:27,206
when you think
there's no one to see.

652
01:07:27,271 --> 01:07:31,046
But what you feel...

653
01:07:31,111 --> 01:07:33,533
what you feel
could only be satisfied

654
01:07:33,608 --> 01:07:36,128
by falling yourself into her.

655
01:07:41,544 --> 01:07:44,675
She's scheduled
for combustion--

656
01:07:44,744 --> 01:07:46,817
tomorrow.

657
01:07:52,456 --> 01:07:54,496
I know.

658
01:07:55,815 --> 01:07:58,052
You know, I was like you.

659
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,917
But the first thing
you learn about emotion

660
01:08:01,992 --> 01:08:04,261
is that it has its price--

661
01:08:04,328 --> 01:08:07,110
a complete paradox.

662
01:08:07,176 --> 01:08:09,926
But without restraint...

663
01:08:09,992 --> 01:08:12,131
without control...

664
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,054
emotion is chaos.

665
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,094
But how is that diff--

666
01:08:16,168 --> 01:08:19,517
The difference being is
that when we want to feel,

667
01:08:19,592 --> 01:08:21,632
we can.

668
01:08:21,704 --> 01:08:25,152
It's just that...

669
01:08:25,223 --> 01:08:28,933
some of us...

670
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,171
some of us have to forgo
that luxury

671
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,239
so that the rest can have it.

672
01:08:34,312 --> 01:08:36,287
Some very few of us

673
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:40,135
have to force ourselves
not to feel.

674
01:08:41,832 --> 01:08:42,945
Like me.

675
01:08:44,744 --> 01:08:46,631
Like you.

676
01:08:51,528 --> 01:08:53,350
What can I do?

677
01:08:55,848 --> 01:08:57,855
You can kill Father.

678
01:09:31,848 --> 01:09:33,637
Cleric John Preston...

679
01:09:33,704 --> 01:09:36,322
you are to come with us
immediately.

680
01:09:45,032 --> 01:09:47,137
Cleric Preston.

681
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:48,321
Sir.

682
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:54,113
I've heard
the most disturbing rumor.

683
01:09:54,184 --> 01:09:55,428
Rumor, sir?

684
01:09:55,496 --> 01:09:56,424
Yes.

685
01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:58,692
A rumor maintaining
that one of us,

686
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,102
one of the Cleric,

687
01:10:00,168 --> 01:10:04,096
has secretly taken it upon
himself to cease his dose,

688
01:10:04,168 --> 01:10:06,885
that one of our elite number

689
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:10,018
is actually feeling.

690
01:10:10,088 --> 01:10:11,943
Feeling, sir?

691
01:10:12,937 --> 01:10:15,522
Are you playing with me,
Cleric?!

692
01:10:20,648 --> 01:10:21,859
No, sir.

693
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:30,269
This person, I'm told,

694
01:10:30,344 --> 01:10:33,890
is actually attempting
to contact the Resistance.

695
01:10:35,848 --> 01:10:39,197
Now tell me,
if you'll be so kind,

696
01:10:39,272 --> 01:10:41,061
how exactly...

697
01:10:41,129 --> 01:10:44,162
have you been making use
of your time of late?

698
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,899
Attempting to contact
the Resistance, sir.

699
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:59,208
Attempting?

700
01:11:00,968 --> 01:11:04,831
How is it that you intend
to expose this traitor

701
01:11:04,904 --> 01:11:07,806
if all you do is attempt?

702
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:14,594
You're...

703
01:11:14,665 --> 01:11:16,421
absolutely...

704
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:18,594
100% right, sir.

705
01:11:19,848 --> 01:11:21,987
Of course I am.

706
01:11:24,296 --> 01:11:27,592
The Cleric is the final line
of defense.

707
01:11:27,657 --> 01:11:29,861
If the Resistance
compromises it,

708
01:11:29,929 --> 01:11:32,263
we are doomed.

709
01:11:32,328 --> 01:11:35,940
Father is doomed.

710
01:11:36,008 --> 01:11:38,529
I will redouble
my efforts, sir,

711
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,324
to locate the Resistance,

712
01:11:40,393 --> 01:11:41,800
to find this traitor,

713
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:45,062
and bring them all to
the Council's fair justice.

714
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,240
Do it.

715
01:12:32,809 --> 01:12:33,987
What are you doing?

716
01:12:37,289 --> 01:12:38,816
What are you doing?

717
01:12:41,609 --> 01:12:43,016
I, uh...

718
01:12:47,753 --> 01:12:50,601
I was checking
to make sure you've been...

719
01:12:50,665 --> 01:12:52,258
taking your interval.

720
01:12:53,322 --> 01:12:54,947
And are you satisfied?

721
01:12:58,378 --> 01:12:59,457
Yes, I am.

722
01:13:02,633 --> 01:13:04,007
Good night, Dad.

723
01:13:06,025 --> 01:13:07,651
I don't understand.

724
01:13:07,722 --> 01:13:10,242
My execution's set.

725
01:13:10,313 --> 01:13:12,647
Why are you here?

726
01:13:31,018 --> 01:13:32,447
Aren't you gonna dose?

727
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:47,657
My God.

728
01:13:49,514 --> 01:13:50,529
What...

729
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:55,522
What'll you do?

730
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:58,626
I don't know.

731
01:14:31,882 --> 01:14:33,092
50 sweepers, maybe more.

732
01:14:33,162 --> 01:14:35,496
What about an audience? Can you
arrange to meet with him?

733
01:14:35,561 --> 01:14:37,471
Father's never given a single
audience since the upheaval.

734
01:14:37,546 --> 01:14:39,040
The danger of assassination
is too great.

735
01:14:39,114 --> 01:14:41,252
They trained you your whole life
to fight these kind of odds.

736
01:14:41,321 --> 01:14:42,914
Even if I could...

737
01:14:42,985 --> 01:14:44,676
even if I could
make it through,

738
01:14:44,745 --> 01:14:47,745
what guarantee is there
it would accomplish anything,

739
01:14:47,818 --> 01:14:49,312
that anything would be
different?

740
01:14:49,386 --> 01:14:52,069
We have a network that's larger
than you could ever imagine.

741
01:14:52,138 --> 01:14:53,960
Instant word comes
that Father is dead,

742
01:14:54,026 --> 01:14:55,400
that the Council is leaderless.

743
01:14:55,465 --> 01:14:57,538
Bombs that have already
been planted will be set off

744
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:59,781
at Prozium clinics and factories
around Libria.

745
01:14:59,849 --> 01:15:02,086
If we can succeed
in disrupting the supply

746
01:15:02,154 --> 01:15:04,707
for even one day-- one day--

747
01:15:04,778 --> 01:15:07,233
our cause will be won
by human nature itself.

748
01:15:07,306 --> 01:15:10,208
What about war, the everyday
cruelties that are all gone now?

749
01:15:10,282 --> 01:15:12,224
Replaced by the touch
of Grammaton.

750
01:15:15,882 --> 01:15:17,856
Will you do it?

751
01:15:25,482 --> 01:15:27,424
Yes.

752
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,211
Can you?

753
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:35,395
I don't know.

754
01:15:45,162 --> 01:15:46,788
Don't--

755
01:15:48,554 --> 01:15:49,961
Seeing her one last time

756
01:15:50,026 --> 01:15:52,993
will only make it harder
to do what you have to do.

757
01:16:26,058 --> 01:16:28,546
...designed especially
to deal with it.

758
01:16:28,618 --> 01:16:30,145
The Cleric was implemented

759
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:32,455
and sent out to search
and destroy

760
01:16:32,522 --> 01:16:33,951
such objects that remained

761
01:16:34,026 --> 01:16:36,841
and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...

762
01:16:36,906 --> 01:16:38,248
File footage.

763
01:16:38,314 --> 01:16:41,795
The Council...

764
01:16:41,866 --> 01:16:44,287
Viviana Preston.

765
01:16:44,362 --> 01:16:46,337
Sentence and incineration.

766
01:16:48,906 --> 01:16:49,921
Auditory.

767
01:16:49,995 --> 01:16:51,304
Viviana Preston,

768
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:53,672
for ceasing your interval,
for the crime of feeling,

769
01:16:53,738 --> 01:16:54,818
you stand condemned

770
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:57,029
to suffer annihilation
in the city furnaces.

771
01:16:57,098 --> 01:17:00,393
You will be taken there
immediately, and you will burn.

772
01:17:16,138 --> 01:17:18,560
The Cleric was implemented

773
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:20,358
and sent out to search
and destroy

774
01:17:20,426 --> 01:17:21,888
such objects that remained

775
01:17:21,962 --> 01:17:25,891
and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...

776
01:17:25,963 --> 01:17:27,850
The Council...

777
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:08,746
The incineration--
has it gone through?!

778
01:18:08,811 --> 01:18:10,502
It's going through now.

779
01:18:10,571 --> 01:18:12,032
Hey!

780
01:18:38,603 --> 01:18:41,602
Machine turbines priming.

781
01:18:41,674 --> 01:18:43,201
Machine turbines priming.

782
01:18:43,275 --> 01:18:45,250
Tetragrammaton-- I need
to speak to this woman!

783
01:18:45,323 --> 01:18:46,883
You're too late, sir.
The time lock is engaged.

784
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:48,133
If we force the door now,

785
01:18:48,203 --> 01:18:49,632
the turbines will explode
at street level.

786
01:18:49,706 --> 01:18:53,023
...personnel,
clear the area immediately.

787
01:18:53,099 --> 01:18:57,321
All unauthorized personnel,
clear the area immediately.

788
01:18:57,386 --> 01:19:00,354
Turbines primed.

789
01:19:00,427 --> 01:19:03,012
Fire in 10 seconds...

790
01:19:03,082 --> 01:19:04,773
9 seconds...

791
01:19:04,843 --> 01:19:06,152
8 seconds...

792
01:19:06,218 --> 01:19:07,462
7 seconds...

793
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:09,701
6 seconds...

794
01:19:09,771 --> 01:19:11,713
5 seconds...

795
01:19:11,786 --> 01:19:12,866
4 seconds...

796
01:19:12,938 --> 01:19:14,499
3 seconds...

797
01:19:14,571 --> 01:19:16,992
2 seconds...

798
01:19:17,067 --> 01:19:20,133
Turbines... fire.

799
01:20:08,747 --> 01:20:11,943
Cleric John Preston...

800
01:20:17,355 --> 01:20:19,265
You are under arrest.

801
01:20:20,843 --> 01:20:22,599
This man--

802
01:20:22,668 --> 01:20:24,839
this senior Cleric--

803
01:20:24,908 --> 01:20:26,730
has ceased the dose.

804
01:20:27,755 --> 01:20:30,210
He is feeling!

805
01:20:30,283 --> 01:20:34,025
He is the worm that has been
eating at the core

806
01:20:34,092 --> 01:20:36,809
of our great society!

807
01:20:36,876 --> 01:20:38,469
And I...

808
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:41,355
I have brought him
for your justice.

809
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,045
Ugh!

810
01:20:45,516 --> 01:20:49,574
I told you I'd make my career
with you, Preston.

811
01:20:50,604 --> 01:20:52,010
Vice-Council...

812
01:20:52,076 --> 01:20:54,214
This man is guilty

813
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:56,007
of consorting
with sense offenders,

814
01:20:56,076 --> 01:20:59,207
of having relations
with a female,

815
01:20:59,275 --> 01:21:02,406
of sense crime itself.

816
01:21:02,476 --> 01:21:04,712
Dispatch a search team
to the Cleric's quarters

817
01:21:04,779 --> 01:21:05,761
to search for unused--

818
01:21:05,836 --> 01:21:07,046
Uh, that won't be
necessary, sir.

819
01:21:07,115 --> 01:21:08,806
If you'll run the trace
record on his side arm,

820
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:10,980
you will find
that it was he

821
01:21:11,051 --> 01:21:13,768
who was with the sweeper team
when they were murdered.

822
01:21:19,148 --> 01:21:20,457
Cleric...

823
01:21:20,524 --> 01:21:22,728
I assume you have something
to say to me.

824
01:21:24,652 --> 01:21:27,139
I know...

825
01:21:27,211 --> 01:21:28,640
it's hard to believe...

826
01:21:31,115 --> 01:21:33,963
...that a Cleric
of the Tetragrammaton

827
01:21:34,028 --> 01:21:36,963
could turn his back
on everything he's been taught,

828
01:21:37,036 --> 01:21:39,403
would become associated
with the Resistance,

829
01:21:39,468 --> 01:21:43,559
even becoming a champion
in its Underground.

830
01:21:43,628 --> 01:21:45,538
But it's true.

831
01:21:49,388 --> 01:21:53,611
I promised that I would
bring you that man.

832
01:21:53,676 --> 01:21:54,691
And I have.

833
01:21:57,452 --> 01:21:59,524
- Cleric Brandt...
- Sir?

834
01:21:59,596 --> 01:22:02,378
The trace shows
that it was your gun

835
01:22:02,444 --> 01:22:04,964
in the Nether
with the sweepers.

836
01:22:05,036 --> 01:22:06,498
That's impossible.

837
01:22:10,828 --> 01:22:13,697
This is wrong.

838
01:22:13,772 --> 01:22:16,423
I think, in the end...

839
01:22:16,492 --> 01:22:19,307
it'll be better
if you have it.

840
01:22:19,372 --> 01:22:21,030
He switched them.

841
01:22:21,964 --> 01:22:23,720
He switched them.

842
01:22:23,788 --> 01:22:25,414
See, I have his gun now.

843
01:22:25,484 --> 01:22:28,135
Of course you do. You took it
when you arrested me.

844
01:22:28,204 --> 01:22:29,097
What?

845
01:22:29,164 --> 01:22:31,302
Take him
to the Hall of Destruction

846
01:22:31,372 --> 01:22:33,544
for summary judgment
and combustion.

847
01:22:33,612 --> 01:22:35,946
Wait, wait, wait. Wait!
I can explain this.

848
01:22:36,012 --> 01:22:39,012
Uh, sir, I'm not feeling!

849
01:22:39,084 --> 01:22:41,386
He is the one who's feeling!

850
01:22:41,452 --> 01:22:42,946
This is a mistake!

851
01:22:44,972 --> 01:22:46,695
Of course...

852
01:22:46,764 --> 01:22:49,546
since a complaint
has been lodged,

853
01:22:49,612 --> 01:22:52,395
law and the letter
is that I allow a team

854
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,794
to carry out the search
of your premises.

855
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:56,900
Do you think that's entirely
necessary, Cleric,

856
01:22:56,972 --> 01:23:00,802
or am I being
too... exacting?

857
01:23:00,876 --> 01:23:03,145
As you say, sir,

858
01:23:03,212 --> 01:23:05,066
it's the law and the letter.

859
01:23:05,132 --> 01:23:08,001
And it doesn't disturb you
in the least

860
01:23:08,076 --> 01:23:10,345
that your colleague
is going to his end?

861
01:23:10,412 --> 01:23:12,746
The only thing
that disturbs me, sir,

862
01:23:12,812 --> 01:23:15,397
is that I am Father's instrument
against the Underground,

863
01:23:15,468 --> 01:23:20,422
and yet... I've never had
the honor of meeting him.

864
01:23:20,492 --> 01:23:22,314
Hmm.

865
01:23:22,412 --> 01:23:24,005
Yes, but, Cleric, you know

866
01:23:24,077 --> 01:23:27,044
that Father never grants
an audience to anyone.

867
01:23:27,116 --> 01:23:29,352
Even to the man
who brings him the Resistance?

868
01:23:41,324 --> 01:23:42,917
Sorry, sir.
Just a formality.

869
01:23:42,988 --> 01:23:45,028
The search team will be up
momentarily.

870
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,588
Excellent.
I have nothing to hide.

871
01:24:06,861 --> 01:24:08,966
The search teams are
already inside, sir.

872
01:24:09,037 --> 01:24:10,280
Excellent.

873
01:24:30,284 --> 01:24:32,488
Looking for something?

874
01:24:37,069 --> 01:24:38,759
If I were you...

875
01:24:38,828 --> 01:24:43,684
I'd be more careful
in the future.

876
01:24:48,589 --> 01:24:49,898
How long?

877
01:24:49,965 --> 01:24:52,136
Since Mom.

878
01:24:54,988 --> 01:24:56,036
And Lisa?

879
01:24:56,108 --> 01:24:57,319
Of course.

880
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:03,493
How did you know?

881
01:25:03,564 --> 01:25:05,986
You forget...

882
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:08,362
it's my job to know
what you're thinking.

883
01:25:11,468 --> 01:25:13,803
Then you know what
I'm gonna do now.

884
01:25:15,789 --> 01:25:19,147
You have a message
for the Vice-Council?

885
01:25:19,213 --> 01:25:21,001
It's done.

886
01:25:21,069 --> 01:25:24,331
I've located the Resistance.

887
01:25:24,397 --> 01:25:26,634
Come now.

888
01:25:26,701 --> 01:25:28,610
You'll have them all.

889
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:53,028
Do not address Father
unless first addressed by him.

890
01:25:53,102 --> 01:25:54,312
Avoid eye contact.

891
01:25:54,381 --> 01:25:57,480
If you should break
his personal security zone,

892
01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:59,971
you will be immediately
put down by snipers.

893
01:26:00,045 --> 01:26:01,638
Is that understood?

894
01:26:01,709 --> 01:26:04,709
You'll be required to surrender
your firearm, of course,

895
01:26:04,781 --> 01:26:06,636
and then there's the test.

896
01:26:06,701 --> 01:26:08,010
Test?

897
01:26:08,973 --> 01:26:11,307
Yes.

898
01:26:11,373 --> 01:26:14,275
You didn't imagine
we would risk exposing Father

899
01:26:14,349 --> 01:26:16,684
to even such a dedicated servant
as yourself

900
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:19,914
without first having
tested you, did you?

901
01:26:23,597 --> 01:26:25,255
Please.

902
01:26:38,574 --> 01:26:40,003
Cleric...

903
01:26:40,077 --> 01:26:41,965
your weapon, please.

904
01:26:46,317 --> 01:26:48,259
Here.

905
01:26:53,005 --> 01:26:54,085
Sit.

906
01:26:57,293 --> 01:26:59,465
We'll start with
a test question first.

907
01:26:59,534 --> 01:27:02,730
More of a riddle, actually.

908
01:27:04,045 --> 01:27:06,085
What would you say
is the easiest way

909
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:08,296
to get a weapon away
from a Grammaton Cleric?

910
01:27:13,582 --> 01:27:16,069
You ask him for it.

911
01:27:23,022 --> 01:27:25,836
I told you I'd make
my career with you, Cleric.

912
01:27:29,165 --> 01:27:30,409
...to combine the capacity...

913
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:33,154
Preston...

914
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:35,597
Brandt's job was simple--

915
01:27:35,662 --> 01:27:38,051
to make you feel
like you'd won,

916
01:27:38,126 --> 01:27:41,159
to make you feel safe.

917
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:47,620
For years, I tried
to infiltrate an agent

918
01:27:47,694 --> 01:27:49,156
into the Underground...

919
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,484
...until it hit me--

920
01:27:52,557 --> 01:27:56,135
in order to pass undetected
into their midst,

921
01:27:56,206 --> 01:27:58,824
in order to be trusted by them,

922
01:27:58,894 --> 01:28:04,044
my provocateur would
have to think like them

923
01:28:04,110 --> 01:28:06,892
and would have to feel
like them.

924
01:28:06,957 --> 01:28:09,772
But where to find
such a man--

925
01:28:09,837 --> 01:28:14,922
a man with the capacity to feel
who didn't yet know it?

926
01:28:17,742 --> 01:28:20,327
But...

927
01:28:20,397 --> 01:28:21,608
we've never met.

928
01:28:21,678 --> 01:28:23,434
No?

929
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:30,692
Don't look so surprised,
Preston.

930
01:28:30,766 --> 01:28:32,554
Why should Father be more real

931
01:28:32,621 --> 01:28:34,988
than any other
political puppet?

932
01:28:35,054 --> 01:28:37,868
The real Father died
years ago.

933
01:28:37,934 --> 01:28:39,788
The Council simply elected me

934
01:28:39,854 --> 01:28:42,636
to pursue
his paternal tradition.

935
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,741
And you, Preston,

936
01:28:44,814 --> 01:28:47,563
the supposed savior
of the Resistance,

937
01:28:47,629 --> 01:28:49,418
are now its destroyer,

938
01:28:49,486 --> 01:28:54,058
and, along with them,
you've given me yourself...

939
01:28:54,126 --> 01:28:55,719
calmly...

940
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:57,579
cooly...

941
01:28:57,646 --> 01:29:02,185
entirely without incident.

942
01:29:06,126 --> 01:29:07,686
No.

943
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:10,126
Oh...

944
01:29:10,894 --> 01:29:12,006
Shit.

945
01:29:13,902 --> 01:29:15,527
Not without incident.

946
01:29:22,254 --> 01:29:23,683
I'm coming.

947
01:30:49,007 --> 01:30:50,796
You really should learn
to knock.

948
01:31:16,271 --> 01:31:19,500
How did it feel, Preston?

949
01:31:32,559 --> 01:31:34,698
- Agh!
- Ugh! Ugh! Uhh-ah!

950
01:31:36,527 --> 01:31:37,869
Wah!

951
01:31:37,935 --> 01:31:39,528
Ugh! Agh! Uhh!

952
01:31:39,599 --> 01:31:41,093
Ugh!

953
01:31:42,255 --> 01:31:43,335
Ugh!

954
01:31:43,407 --> 01:31:45,349
- Aggh!
- Aggh!

955
01:31:58,607 --> 01:32:01,324
Mind the uniform, Cleric.

956
01:32:06,703 --> 01:32:09,737
I plan to be wearing it
for a long time.

957
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:46,665
Be careful, Preston.

958
01:32:46,736 --> 01:32:49,005
You're treading on my dreams.

959
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:23,883
Ohh!

960
01:33:23,951 --> 01:33:25,642
Wait!

961
01:33:25,711 --> 01:33:26,693
Wait.

962
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:29,255
Look at me.

963
01:33:31,311 --> 01:33:32,904
I'm life.

964
01:33:32,975 --> 01:33:36,324
I live, I-I breathe...

965
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,727
I feel.

966
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:44,363
Now that you know it...

967
01:33:44,432 --> 01:33:47,115
can you really take it?

968
01:33:47,183 --> 01:33:49,125
Is it really worth the price?

969
01:33:54,992 --> 01:33:56,650
I pay it gladly.
