1
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,538
For those regarded as warriors...

2
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,374
when engaged in combat...

3
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:20,295
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be the warriors only concern.

4
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:28,011
Suppress every human emotions and compassion...

5
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:39,523
kill whoever stands in thy way,
even if that be the Lord God, or the Buddha himself.

6
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:51,660
This truth lies at the heart of combat.

7
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:12,431
Look at me, Matsumoto...

8
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:17,352
take a good look at my face.

9
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:21,607
Look at my eyes.

10
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,777
Look at my nose.

11
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,031
Look at my chin.

12
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:32,910
Look at my mouth.

13
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:37,581
Do I look familiar?

14
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:45,130
Do I look like someone you murdered?

15
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:55,964
Welcome...

16
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:41,635
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.

17
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:44,888
I'm just watching my soap operas.

18
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:48,058
Lazy bastard.

19
00:46:48,392 --> 00:46:50,477
Screw your soap opera...

20
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:54,273
The tea is hot. Why do don't you serve it yourself for once?

21
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:20,859
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea?
Hurry up... goddammit!

22
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:25,989
Lazy oaf.

23
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:35,415
What'd ya want?

24
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:49,972
One warm sake!

25
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:53,267
Sake? In the middle of the day?

26
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:57,980
- Day, night, afternoon, Who gives a damn? Get the sake!

27
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:00,941
How come I always have to get the sake?

28
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:02,234
Listen carefully...

29
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:05,863
For 30 years you make the
fish, and I get the sake.

30
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:07,948
If this were the military,

31
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:11,577
I'd be a General by now.

32
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:14,496
Oh, so you'd be general, huh?

33
00:49:14,538 --> 00:49:18,333
If you were General, I'd be Emperor,

34
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,919
and you would still get the sake.

35
00:49:21,003 --> 00:49:23,380
So shut up and get the sake!

36
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:26,592
I'm not bald, okay?
I shave my head.

37
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:20,145
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

38
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:24,191
I need Japanese steel.

39
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,363
Why do you need Japanese steel?

40
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,909
I have vermin to kill.

41
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,386
I wanted to show you these.

42
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:41,513
However...

43
00:53:42,556 --> 00:53:45,934
Someone as you, who knows so much, must surely know...

44
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:51,481
I no longer make instruments of death.

45
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:54,401
What I have here...

46
00:53:55,444 --> 00:54:00,949
I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.

47
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:06,121
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...

48
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:14,588
I have retired.

49
00:55:50,601 --> 00:55:52,311
You can sleep here.

50
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:55,564
It will take me a month

51
00:55:58,192 --> 00:55:59,693
to make a sword.

52
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:03,614
I suggest you spend it practising.

53
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:34,121
I complete doing...

54
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:39,793
what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,

55
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:45,674
To never do again.

56
00:57:48,427 --> 00:57:52,264
I created something that kills people.

57
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:59,646
And in that respect, it is a success.

58
00:58:02,858 --> 00:58:05,110
I've done this because I am sympathetic to your aim.

59
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:11,700


60
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:20,334
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

61
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:25,214
If on your journey, you should encounter God...

62
00:58:25,255 --> 00:58:28,300
God will be slashed

63
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:42,981
Yellow-haired warrior. Go.

64
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:45,067


65
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:11,862
Do you like Ferraris?

66
01:00:15,824 --> 01:00:17,910
Ferrari... Italian trash.

67
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:28,962
Do you want to fuck me?

68
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:34,301
Don't laugh! Do you want
to fuck me. yes or no?

69
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:36,678
Yes.

70
01:00:40,682 --> 01:00:41,975
Haw about now. Big boy?

71
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:45,771
Do you still wish to penetrate me?

72
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:49,566
or is it I...

73
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:51,568
who as penetrated you?

74
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:46,707
Boss Tanaka. What's the meaning of this outburst?

75
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:48,667
This is a time for celebration.

76
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:52,045
And what exactly are we celebrating?

77
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:55,924
The perversion of our illustrious council?

78
01:01:57,843 --> 01:02:00,929
Tanaka, have you gone mad?!

79
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:02,097
I will not tolerate it!

80
01:02:02,264 --> 01:02:04,266
You're disrespecting our sister!
Apologize!

81
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:10,898
Tanaka—San, of what perversion do you speak?

82
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,197
My father along with your, and along

83
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,074
with yours, started this council.

84
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:24,119
And while...

85
01:02:24,203 --> 01:02:25,370
you laugh like stupid donkeys...

86
01:02:25,746 --> 01:02:27,539
they weep in the afterlife...

87
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:29,124
Shut up!

88
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:31,960
Over the perversion committed today.

89
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:35,130
Outrageous! Tanaka, it is you

90
01:02:35,797 --> 01:02:37,966
who insults this council!

91
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,178
- Bastard!
- Fuck face!

92
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:43,347
Gentlemen.

93
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:51,146
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

94
01:02:52,606 --> 01:02:56,818
By all means allow him to express it.

95
01:02:57,653 --> 01:03:02,032
I speak of the perversion done to this council,

96
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:05,160
which I love...

97
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:07,412
more than my own children.

98
01:03:08,622 --> 01:03:13,418
by making a Chinese Jap-American half breed bitch its leader.

99
01:03:33,772 --> 01:03:40,571
So you understand how serious I am...

100
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:42,698
I am going to say this in English.

101
01:04:51,308 --> 01:04:53,810
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.

102
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:12,165
You have to say, "Yes, yes, yes" to any selfish demands they make.

103
01:12:12,207 --> 01:12:13,709
They demand ridiculous things.

104
01:12:13,834 --> 01:12:16,211
Shut up... do you know what would
happen if they hear you?

105
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:17,129
What's gonna happen?

106
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:18,630
Ever heard of the Tanaka clan?

107
01:12:18,755 --> 01:12:20,465
You're gonna get your head chopped off.

108
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:21,425
No I do not want this.

109
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:10,766
Yes speaking.

110
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:18,232
If you give us a contact
number, we will get back to you.

111
01:13:33,914 --> 01:13:36,458
Who do you remind me of? Charlie Brown.

112
01:13:40,587 --> 01:13:43,048
You're right, he does look like Charlie Brown.

113
01:13:44,424 --> 01:13:45,884
Charlie Brown, four pepperoni pizzas.

114
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:47,511
That's not on our menu...

115
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:49,888
I do not care. bring them, goddammit.

116
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:53,767
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.

117
01:13:58,564 --> 01:14:01,984
You and I have unfinished business.

118
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:34,284
Charlie Brown, beat it.

119
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:03,146
Tear the bitch apart!

120
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:47,167
Gogo, right?

121
01:17:50,712 --> 01:17:52,506
And you are Black Mamba.

122
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,636
Our reputations precedes us.

123
01:17:58,971 --> 01:18:00,305
Don't they.

124
01:18:19,867 --> 01:18:21,535
You call that begging?

125
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:30,460
You can beg better than that.

126
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:03,654
Those of you lucky enough to still have your lives,

127
01:30:03,695 --> 01:30:05,948
take them with you.

128
01:30:08,075 --> 01:30:09,284
However...

129
01:30:10,661 --> 01:30:14,581
leave the limbs you've lost.

130
01:30:15,832 --> 01:30:19,211
They belong to me now.

131
01:31:31,074 --> 01:31:32,743
Where was it made?

132
01:31:37,956 --> 01:31:40,834
Whom in Okinawa, made you this steel?

133
01:31:44,129 --> 01:31:45,422
You lie!

134
01:31:58,352 --> 01:32:00,646
Swords, however, never get tired.

135
01:32:02,022 --> 01:32:05,442
I hope you have saved your energy.

136
01:32:09,112 --> 01:32:10,364
If you haven't...

137
01:32:12,449 --> 01:32:14,451
you might not last five minutes.

138
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:18,705
But as last looks go,

139
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:22,543
you could do worse.

140
01:35:46,872 --> 01:35:48,373
Attack me...

141
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:51,210
with everything you have.

142
01:36:46,473 --> 01:36:49,226
For ridiculing you earlier...

143
01:36:51,812 --> 01:36:53,730
I apologise.

144
01:37:02,322 --> 01:37:03,490
Accepted.

145
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:20,966
Ready?

146
01:37:26,138 --> 01:37:27,264
Come on.

147
01:38:00,506 --> 01:38:09,389
That really was a Hattori-Hanzo sword.

148
01:40:52,177 --> 01:40:55,055
Burn in Hell you stupid, stupid blonde!

149
01:40:55,097 --> 01:40:56,723
I'll tell you nothing.

150
02:28:41,547 --> 02:28:42,631
Master.

151
02:28:44,466 --> 02:28:46,176
Your Mandarin is lousy.

152
02:28:47,135 --> 02:28:48,512
It causes my ears discomfort.

153
02:28:48,595 --> 02:28:50,180
You bray like a donkey.

154
02:28:50,973 --> 02:28:53,141
You are  not to speak unless spoken to.

155
02:28:54,017 --> 02:28:57,646
Is it too much to hope you 
understand Cantonese?

156
02:29:01,358 --> 02:29:02,734
I speak Japanese very well.

157
02:29:02,818 --> 02:29:06,113
I did not ask you if
you speak Japanese.

158
02:29:06,196 --> 02:29:08,323
I asked if you understood Cantonese?

159
02:29:11,577 --> 02:29:16,164
You are here to learn 
Kung-Fu, not linguistics.

160
02:29:16,582 --> 02:29:20,252
If you can't understand me, I will communicate with you like I would a dog.

161
02:29:20,544 --> 02:29:24,047
When I yell, when I point,
when I beat you with my stick.

162
02:29:30,137 --> 02:29:32,014
Bill is your master, is he not?

163
02:29:37,728 --> 02:29:41,523
He tells me you're not entirely unschooled.

164
02:29:42,482 --> 02:29:43,901
What is your training?

165
02:29:52,784 --> 02:29:55,287
"The exquisite are of the samurai sword." Don't make me laugh.

166
02:29:55,829 --> 02:30:00,375
Your so-called exquisite art, is only fit for...

167
02:30:00,751 --> 02:30:02,377
Japanese fatheads!

168
02:30:07,508 --> 02:30:12,638
Your anger amuses me.
Do you believe you are my match?

169
02:30:13,180 --> 02:30:14,223
No.

170
02:30:14,431 --> 02:30:16,558
Are you aware I kill at will?

171
02:30:17,226 --> 02:30:18,310
Yes.

172
02:30:18,810 --> 02:30:20,979
- Is it your wish to die?
- No.

173
02:30:23,148 --> 02:30:26,485
Then you must be stupid... so stupid.

174
02:30:26,568 --> 02:30:30,322
Rise, and let me look at your ridiculous face.

175
02:30:30,822 --> 02:30:31,990
Rise.

176
02:30:36,537 --> 02:30:42,125
So, my pathetic friend, is there anything that you can do well?

177
02:30:43,001 --> 02:30:44,920
What's the matter?

178
02:30:45,379 --> 02:30:47,297
Cat got your tongue?

179
02:30:48,757 --> 02:30:51,760
Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

180
02:30:52,386 --> 02:30:53,804
I despise the goddamn Japs!

181
02:30:56,849 --> 02:30:58,600
Go to the rack.

182
02:31:06,859 --> 02:31:07,860
Remove the sword.

183
02:31:34,178 --> 02:31:35,971
Let's see how good you really are.

184
02:31:36,847 --> 02:31:38,473
If...

185
02:31:39,141 --> 02:31:40,851
you land a single blow,

186
02:31:42,603 --> 02:31:44,313
I'll bow down and call you "Master"

187
02:31:58,577 --> 02:32:00,996
From here you can get an excellent view of my foot.

188
02:32:06,210 --> 02:32:09,713
Your swordsmanship is amateur at best.

189
02:32:23,685 --> 02:32:29,024
Your so-called kung-fu
is really quite pathetic.

190
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:35,697
I asked you to demonstrate what you know and you did...

191
02:32:36,365 --> 02:32:37,574
Not a goddamn thing.

192
02:32:38,659 --> 02:32:42,287
Let's see your Tiger-Crane style
match my Eagle's Claw?

193
02:33:39,428 --> 02:33:41,388
Like all Yankee women

194
02:33:41,471 --> 02:33:45,017
all you can do is order in
restaurants and spend a man's money.

195
02:33:46,101 --> 02:33:47,728
Excruciating, isn't it?

196
02:33:47,811 --> 02:33:49,104
Yes!

197
02:33:50,647 --> 02:33:53,817
If it was my wish, I could chop your arm off.

198
02:33:56,612 --> 02:33:58,947
It's my arm now. I can do what I please.

199
02:33:59,573 --> 02:34:01,783
If you can stop me I suggest you try.

200
02:34:04,036 --> 02:34:05,037
I can't!

201
02:34:06,205 --> 02:34:07,706
Because you're helpless?

202
02:34:08,207 --> 02:34:09,208
Yes!

203
02:34:11,835 --> 02:34:13,962
Have you ever felt this before?

204
02:34:14,338 --> 02:34:15,339
No!

205
02:34:15,422 --> 02:34:18,800
Compared to me, you're as helpless as a
worm fighting an eagle?

206
02:34:19,801 --> 02:34:24,097
- Yes!
- That's the beginning!

207
02:34:29,728 --> 02:34:32,356
Is it your wish to possess this kind of power?

208
02:34:38,237 --> 02:34:40,989
Your training will begin tomorrow.

209
02:34:49,790 --> 02:34:53,335
Since your arm now belongs to me, I want it strong.

210
02:34:54,920 --> 02:34:56,338
Can you do that?

211
02:34:58,006 --> 02:34:59,675
I can, but not that close.

212
02:34:59,842 --> 02:35:01,176
Then you can't do it.

213
02:35:02,386 --> 02:35:06,181
What if your enemy is three inches in front of you?

214
02:35:07,224 --> 02:35:08,517
What do you do then?

215
02:35:09,434 --> 02:35:10,727
Curl up into a ball,

216
02:35:12,062 --> 02:35:13,689
or do you put your fist through him?

217
02:35:15,232 --> 02:35:16,275
Now begin.

218
02:35:48,223 --> 02:35:52,311
It's the wood that should fear your hand, not the other way around.

219
02:35:53,103 --> 02:35:58,901
No wonder you can do it, you acquiesce to defeat before you even begin.

220
02:37:47,342 --> 02:37:49,595
If you want to eat like a dog,

221
02:37:50,846 --> 02:37:53,015
you can live and sleep outside like a dog.

222
02:37:55,350 --> 02:37:57,269
If you want to live and sleep like a human,

223
02:37:58,854 --> 02:38:00,355
pick up those chopsticks.

224
02:59:52,042 --> 02:59:55,504
Elle, you treacherous bitch...

225
03:00:00,259 --> 03:00:02,594
I give you my word...
