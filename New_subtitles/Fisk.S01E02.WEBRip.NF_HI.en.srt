00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,400

[theme music plays]

00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,600
-No.
-Yep.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,000
Just checking
the ban is still in place.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,200
And it is.

[Roz] Higher. Higher. Lower.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,320
Morning, Roz. Webmaster.

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,600
Morning, Helen. No, no, straighter.

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,400
-A bit more to the right. Yes, good.
-I'll just...

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,720
Good. A bit more to the right.
And let it go.

-[yells] Hey, Helen, stop!
-[screams]

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,040
-Don't go in there!
-OK! Why not?! What's going on?!

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,480
No, I'm just excited. I've got your
office ready. Totally styled it out.

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,320
-This way.
-OK.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,040
-You... You all good?
-Yeah.

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,080
Might just need a minute.

[breathes shakily]

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,480
You know, I'm quite highly strung.
Maybe don't yell at me.

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,560
[whirrs]

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
-This one?
-No. That's a cupboard.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,240
This is your office.

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,360
Oh! Which is also a cupboard.

30
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,280
Very unpretentious.

31
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,640
And I like that I can
interrogate suspects in here too.

32
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,320
How about this desk?

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,160
Ooh, it looks
a bit different to the picture.

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,520
I know! It's a hack! I hacked it!
What do you think?

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,840
I'm not sure you needed to,
but Ok, yeah, why not?

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,440
Liaise with George
for anything you might need.

37
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,240
Don't go wild, obviously.
We are on a budget.

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,200
Mm-hm.

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,440
This is for clients.

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,280
Maybe I could get something
a bit more comfortable for clients.

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,200
Yep.
[clicking]

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,600
Is that doing anything?

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,040
Um... Not in here.

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,240
Mm. Not out here either.

45
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,720
What about a print or something
to cover the mould on that wall?

46
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,920
There's this website that does,
like, inspirational work posters -

47
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,360
you know, like, "Live, laugh, love,"
that kind of thing.

48
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,560
I don't really do
any of those things.

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,920
You can make your own one.

50
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,919
Like, you could have,
"Meeting, lunch, phone call,"

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,840
-or something.
-Sure. That's really inspiring.

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,560
Well, you would personalize it.
What do you like?

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,280
Um... I like my dog.

54
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,000
Uh... Soup. I really like soup.

55
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,480
Watching television.

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,520
Tea. Scones. Obviously go together.

57
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,720
Ooh, butterscotch.
Always better than you think.

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,520
You sound like my grandma.

59
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,360
Yeah, I do like big pants.

60
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,400
-Just...they keep me secure.
-Yeah.

61
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,000
Hello, Bob! How are you?

62
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,360
Rozalind Gru-bear! Good to see ya!

63
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,960
I hope we can sort this out quickly.

64
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,600
I've got a dim sum lunch
I've got to get to.

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,240
Not up to me, I'm afraid.

66
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,240
I've handed this one over to
our new colleague, Helen Tudor-Fisk.

67
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,640
-Fisk?
-Mm.

68
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,640
-Fisk - any relation to...
-Father.

69
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,520
Well, well, interesting!
Are the rumours true? Do we know?

70
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,320
You know,
about Dad and the tipstaff?

71
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,560
Helen.

72
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,720
-This is Bob Stanley.
-Hello, Bob.

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,880
It's all true, Mum died,
Dad kicked that closet door down

74
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,840
and came out screaming,
ran off with his tipstaff.

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,240
It's been quite the roller-coaster
ride. Should we head on in?

76
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,000
[tram bell dings]

77
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,120
[indistinct chatter]

78
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,800
Ok, the will states
that the cremains are to be divided

79
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,840
between the family of
Alan Munster and Kellie-Joy Frazer.

80
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,640
Obviously I should get
the whole vase of ashes,

81
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,280
but if Ally says half,
I'll accept half, please, thank you.

82
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,720
Ooh, hang on,
the will does not specify half.

83
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,360
It simply says,
"cremains to be divided."

84
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,760
That's what we're here to determine.

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,680
-But I'm the widow.
-Widow... Were you married?

86
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,360
-That feels like new information...
-No, they weren't married.

87
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,840
Me and Ally-bear
were married in our hearts.

88
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,480
Don't need a piece of paper
to be married.

89
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,960
I think that's exactly what you need
to be married.

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,320
Yeah... Hey, are there any snacks?

91
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,160
I'm...I'm quite peckish.
Roz usually serves snacks.

92
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,400
Sorry. No snacks. What's...?

93
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,080
Oh, that's a shame.
A bit of cheese floating around?

94
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,400
No, Bob. No floating cheese.

95
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,880
I just need to clarify

96
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,600
exactly how long you were
in a relationship with Mr Munster.

97
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,519
Five minutes.

98
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,720
Um... Instagram begs to differ.

99
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,520
We've been an official couple
since October last year.

100
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,440
But, before that, it was just
flirting around the office,

101
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,040
a bit of sexting.

102
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,400
Oh, God.
My poor mother didn't deserve this.

103
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,640
No, that's pretty...
Oh, that's hard to look at.

104
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800
He was living his best life, Gina.

105
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,240
There's a saying, you know?

106
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,160
"Why go out for steak when
you're getting the milk for free?"

107
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,240
[both] What?

108
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,680
Uh... I believe the expression is,

109
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,640
"Why got for a hamburger
when you're getting steak at home?"

110
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Right.

111
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,560
Sorry, but I still don't
quite understand what you're saying.

112
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,280
I'm saying I'm the steak.

113
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,160
Yeah, nah, I think in that scenario,
you're the hamburger.

114
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,640
I'm not the hamburger!

115
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,040
I'm fillet steak.

116
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,560
You're really not.
You're more like a kebab.

117
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,960
Mm.

118
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,760
Yum.

119
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Oh!

120
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,960
Roz?

121
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,920
I've just seen Bob Stanley
in the meeting room.

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,760
-Is this yours?
-Don't know.

123
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,360
Hang on, that's mine.
Jesus, take it easy.

124
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,000
That's... Yeah. That one's gone.

125
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,560
Why are there no snacks in there?

126
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,160
Let's get some taramasalata,
some tzatziki in there.

127
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,760
Bob will agree to anything
if there's snacks.

128
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,280
I thought I wasn't allowed
anywhere near legal proceedings.

129
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,800
Just find some bloody hummus
and put Bob's name on it.

130
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,280
And it's 'hou-mus'.

131
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,720
[traffic drones]

132
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,200
[crunching]

133
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,640
OK, so, with regard...

134
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,320
-That's good hummus.
-Yep.

135
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,360
-Very happy with that.
-Ok.

136
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,120
So, with regard to
the division of the cremains,

137
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,760
we would like to make an offer
of five grams, or one teaspoon.

138
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,600
-One teaspoon?!
-Which I realize

139
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,040
doesn't sound like much, however,
it is enough to pop in, say, a locket

140
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,800
or some other kind of keepsake.

141
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,880
-A what-sake?
-Like a memento, a keepsake.

142
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,320
For example, there's a company

143
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
that will put a small amount of ashes
into a snow globe.

144
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,440
Mm, that's nice.

145
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,760
Do you think? Uh... Yeah, nice.

146
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,600
Uh... Sometimes people mix the ashes
with ink and get a tattoo.

147
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,920
-Really?
-Relax.

148
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yep, definitely doing that.
I could get a teddy bear,

149
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,800
my own little Ally-bear
on my shoulder maybe.

150
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,720
I would've thought a tramp stamp
would be more suitable.

151
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,160
I've already got one, Gina,
so joke's on you.

152
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,200
[whispers indistinctly]

153
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,320
Mm. Um... My client...

154
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,920
Hang on. Sorry. Chewing.

155
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,720
Sorry, that's not fair.

156
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,280
I'm gonna need more than five grams

157
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,480
if I'm gonna get a tattoo
and a snow globe.

158
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,320
It actually is fair
because we've done the calculations.

159
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,560
Let me talk you through them
and then you'll see how we got there.

160
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,840
Ok, so...

161
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,440
what we need to do

162
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,760
is compare the amount of time
you spent with Mr Munster

163
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
versus the time
he spent with his family.

164
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,760
So, over here on your side,

165
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,000
you say you were together six months,
I'm taking you at your word,

166
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
including that extra bit
at the beginning,

167
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,000
we end up with about 7.44 months.

168
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,480
Versus a 48-year marriage
with two children,

169
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,280
combined ages of which are 76 years.

170
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,360
Now, 76 and 48 - that's a 124 years.

171
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,440
In order to compare that with this,
we need to convert that to months.

172
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,040
So, we times it by 12.
We end up with 1,488 months.

173
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,680
Now we're comparing
apples with apples.

174
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,160
Then we factor in
the weight of the ashes.

175
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,160
Now, that's approximately
one to three kilograms,

176
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,560
so what we go with is units,
then we convert it back to grams,

177
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,040
and what we end up with
is five grams, one teaspoon.

178
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,120
It was actually 4.7, but
I'm being generous, I've rounded up.

179
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,720
So, what do we think? Bob?

180
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,760
Yeah, um...

181
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,240
That's imp... It's impressive.

182
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,240
Yeah, I actually think
that's quite a fair deal.

183
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,120
So, are we all happy with that?

184
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,320
I know you're not happy with it.
But we agree to that?

185
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,480
-Yeah.
-Great.

186
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Well, I'm gonna call the funeral home
and get them to release the ashes.

187
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,720
Mm.

188
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,200
Make sure I get a good five grams.

189
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,560
Like, from his heart, you know?
I don't want foot ashes or anything.

190
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,160
[exhales heavily]

191
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,120
Vis-a-vis our next meeting, Helen,

192
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,680
what do you think about
a few deli meats?

193
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,240
Maybe some lavash?

194
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,600
Yeah, I'll get on that.

195
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,360
Do you wanna take the hummus?
No-one else wants it, Bob.

196
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,120
Oh, yeah. For sure.

197
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,680
Thanks.

198
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,960
And any snacks you'd like
for the next meeting or...

199
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,560
a bit upset?

200
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,640
[quietly] Ok.

201
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,720
[engine starts]

202
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,280
[rings doorbell]

203
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,039
-Oh, Viktor.
-Helen!

204
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,600
What's going on?
I don't have you in the diary.

205
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,200
-I thought you'd be at work.
-I'm on... [sniffs]

206
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,440
I'm on long-service leave.
What is that smell?

207
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,720
You haven't got
that dog with you, have you?

208
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,720
-No.
-You know I'm allergic.

209
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,560
-Yes.
-Oh, it's like popcorn and wet meat.

210
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,880
No, I think that's just me.
Is Dad home?

211
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,520
-Yes. Why?
-Do I need a reason?

212
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,960
Maybe I just want to say hi.

213
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,760
-Really?
-Yes!

214
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,480
And I would also like to borrow
the George Foreman Grill, please,

215
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,320
because the cooktop at my Airbnb
is broken.

216
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh, Helen. Is this how you thought
your life would turn out?

217
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,360
You're divorced,
you're living in a bedsit,

218
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,720
you're eating steaks
cooked in a sandwich maker.

219
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,560
It's not a sandwich maker. It's a...
lean, mean grilling machine,

220
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,520
Look, why don't you pick it up
on Sunday when you come for lunch?

221
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,880
Oh, you're not the boss of my dad,
Viktor, Ok?

222
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,800
[scoffs] I was his tipstaff
for 15 years, Helen.

223
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,560
I think you'll find
I have been the boss of your dad

224
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,840
for quite some time.

225
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,040
Fine. I will get it on Sunday.

226
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,240
Well, lovely. We'll look forward
to seeing you then.

227
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,720
Dad's doing a seafood buffet.

228
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,440
Ooh, goody! Fish!

229
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,960
No-one's favourite. Bleugh!

230
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,120
[phone rings]

231
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,440
Yes, Viktor?

232
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,160
I want you to call May and Graham
and invite them to Sunday lunch.

233
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,160
Why do I have to call them?
It's your lunch.

234
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,640
They're your aunt and uncle.

235
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,520
I want everyone there.
I've got a big announcement.

236
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,120
[chuckles] Is that a euphemism?

237
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
Viktor, I said is that a euphemism?

238
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,400
Yes, Helen, I heard you.
Don't be common.

239
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,040
Just call your aunt and uncle,
please. Thank you. Goodbye.

240
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,360
[phone beeps]

241
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,920
Wow!

242
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,360
Look what you've done.

243
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,400
It's like a room reveal on <i>The Block.</i>

244
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,160
All this for $80 at Kmart.
Can you believe it?

245
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,440
-Yes, I can.
-Check this out!

246
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,200
The most comfortable ever chair
for clients.

247
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,600
Chair, you reckon?

248
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,320
I really thought outside the box
for this one.

249
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,360
Yeah. And...what is that? A fez?

250
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,520
Yeah, maybe for a monkey.

251
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,080
Mm-hm.

252
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,920

[clicks lightswitch]

255
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Doesn't mean she can come in here
any time she wants

256
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,800
and watch TV
and fall asleep on the couch.

257
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,000
She was asleep on the couch the
other day when I came home from work.

258
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,600
But if you're not here,
what does it matter?

259
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,440
It matters because it's against
the rules and I'm renting the house.

260
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,560
OK, fine. I'll make sure she doesn't
come in and watch TV here anymore.

261
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,080
Thank you.

262
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,200
Well, don't come into my...

263
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,680
Oh. OK, well, this is petty.

264
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,080
It's plugged in at the wall as well.
You're gonna have to...

265
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,560
Now it's not.

266
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,880
Ok.

267
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,880
Good.

268
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,600
I'll just read a book.
It's better for you.

-Hi!

May, Helen. God, that's a fun top.

288
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,520
Looks like you've joined
a mime school! I love it.

-Is Graham coming?
-Yeah.

-Latest acquisition on the easel.
-Mm.

00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,520
It's pretty graphic, Viktor.

295
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,560
It's just a body, Helen.
We've all got one.

296
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,080
-That guy's got a massive one.

-I thought you didn't like fish.
-What?

302
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,040
You remember
when I wanted to make boiled fish,

303
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,520
you said Helen doesn't like fish.

304
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,720
Nobody likes boiled fish, Graham.

305
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,520
-So, do you like fish now, Helen?
-Yeah, I love it, Graham.

306

-Oh, good.

You encase the whole fish
in a simple dough

Before we enjoy

we just wanted to announce
that last Thursday...

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,680
-we got married.
-Mm.

315
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,560
I know, can you believe it?
So, here's cheers.

316
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,040
To Tippy and Tony.

317
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,520
-Tip and Tone.
-Tip and Tone.

318
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,440
Dad, why didn't you tell me?
Why wasn't I invited?

319
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,360
It was just a simple service in the
registrar's office. Nothing fancy.

320
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,360
I figured
we wouldn't trouble you with it.

321
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,600
Well... Well, I'm shocked.

322
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,320
It's perfectly legal.
A lot of gay people get married now.

323
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,560
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, she knows it's legal, Graham.

324
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,760
She's just...surprised.

325
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,320
We all are.

326
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,520
Sauce. I forgot the sauce.

327
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,560
Mm. It's not all you forgot,
is it, Dad?

00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,280
Anthony has been a widower
for over two years now...

329
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,800
Yes, thank you, Viktor.

330
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,840
I'm well aware of
when my sister died.

331
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,800
I might have some of this fish.
Looks so moist.

332
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,160
[both] Don't say 'moist'.

333
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,200

-Oh.

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,840
Sorry, Tony,
did you want the last potato?

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,680

daylight. Do you see it?

Yes, yes, but, Tony,
don't worry about it.

342
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,800
Leave it alone.
You'll just make it angry.

343
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,600
-What is it?
-Oh, it's a possum.

344
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,320
It eats his magnolia tree and
it craps all over the porte-cochere.

345
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,880
-The what?
-Oh, the driveway.

346
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,360
-They've been watching The Crown.
-Oh!

347
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,840
Dad, no, don't, don't.

348
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,200
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

349
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
[thud!]
Oh, sh...shit.

350
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
[screams]
Oh, my God!

351
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,800
Anthony! You've killed it!

352
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,120
No, no, it's just playing possum.
That's what they do.

353
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,640
Helen, go and poke it with a stick.
Make sure it's dead.

354
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,680
I'm not gonna poke...
Why do I have to poke it? Just...

355
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,720
Dad, are you alright?

356
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,920
-Oh, come on.
-May, take him inside.

357
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,520
Open the door, Viktor. Jesus. It's
not gonna get you now, it's dead!

358
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Quickly, quickly, come in.
Don't let it in.

359
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,400
Oh, for God's sake.
He's got an armoury, Viktor!

360
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,960
Why is he making weapons?

361
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,840
Ready?

362
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,040
Ooh, God!

363
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,720
Sweeping.

364
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,240
[groans]

365
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,920
Argh.

366
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,560
Ready?

367
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,160
Ohh!

368
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,680
-We'll see you soon.
-Yeah. You're alright? Recovered?

369
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,440
-Bye, Viktor!
-Bye.

370
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,440
See you, Graham.

371
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,880
How's... Is Dad alright?

372
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,040
Yeah, he's fine, he's fine.
Aren't you forgetting something?

373
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,320
-No, I've got my grill, I'm good.
-Oh, Helen, for God's sake.

374
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,320
I'm sorry, Viktor,
I didn't know we did hugs.

375
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,040
-There we go.
-Ooh... Oh. Well, that's nice.

376
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,040
I meant that.

377
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,280
No, I don't want leftovers.

378
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,680
-It's the possum.
-What? No.

379
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
We cannot have evidence
on our property, Ok?

380
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,240
I'm not taking it.
It's in the esky. Just take it.

381
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,760
-Go. Go.
-Ohh... Why is it in an esky?

382
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,120
What are you keeping it fresh for?
Helen, get it out of here, please.

383
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,160
-Thank you.
-Thanks for a lovely afternoon!

384
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,000
Jesus.

385
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,160
Ok.

386
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,520
Ok.

387
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,080
Argh.

388
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,120
[dog barks]

389
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,600
Hang on, Artie!
I know, buddy, hang on...

390
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,880
[groans]

391
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,360
Shit.
[barking continues]

392
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,440
I'm coming!

393
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,840
That isn't gonna...

394
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,240
[barking continues]

395
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,040
Just... Don't poo on the rug!

396
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,920
[bird caws]

397
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,839
[whines]

398
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,960
Juliana.

399
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,480
Gran said you left a dead cat
in an esky at her front door.

400
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,600
Is that some kind of racist taunt?

401
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,840
No, oh, God, no. God, no. No, it's
not a cat, it's a...it's a possum.

402
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,080
Oh! It's a possum in an esky!

403
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,800
Oh, that's alright then.
That's not weird at all.

404
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,360
Yeah, I'm really sorry.
The bins were full.

405
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,400
But give it to me, I'll get rid of
it. There's a skip down the road.

406
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
-Where is it?
-It's gone.

407
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,200
Gran burned it.
Oh.

408
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Ok. Well, good result. Thanks, Minh.

409
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,000
Mm. Gran wants you out by Friday.
You're too much trouble.

410
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,640
But, no, I've got a booking
for two months.

411
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,920
Well, your booking is cancelled.
You can't cancel my booking.

412
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,280
Um... I think I just did. It's
an Airbnb, Helen, there's no rules.

413
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,320
No rules? Yeah, Ok,
well, how about I call the council

414
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,320
and say there's an old lady
having a backyard burn-off?

415
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,800
Will they just say,
"That's Ok, Helen,

416
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,480
"it's Airbnb, there's no rules"?
Don't think so.

417
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,880
Mm. Get out.

418
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh, fine. I'll be out by Friday.

419
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,680
No. Get out now.

420
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,080
[dog whines]
It'll be a week tops. Thanks, Dad.

421
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,040
[Viktor] For heaven's sake, Tony!
[dog barks]

422
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,200
No! No, no, no, no, no!

423
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,760
Helen, you come back here!

424
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,560
I have allergies!
I've got allergies!

425
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,640
-Naughty Viktor. Hello!
-Thank you.

426
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,320
And you're definitely Ok
if I stay here?!

427
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,920
Oh. Yep! Fine!

428
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,960
-Bye!
-Thank you!

429
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,040
Bye!

430
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,440
Man, you look tired.

431
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,320
Yeah, well,
I've had a very stressful morning.

432
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,240
No, I mean like...really tired.

433
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,680
I got kicked out of my Airbnb.
I had to leave all the stuff there...

434
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,600
Ooh, Christ, you look like shit.

435
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,280
That's what I just said!

436
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,360
-Morning!
-Yes, I know! I look terrible!

437
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,680
Do you? You look like
you always look to me.

438
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,200
[sighs]

439
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,280
[phone buzzes]

440
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,000
[bubbling]

441
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,280
Please, Gina,
take a very comfortable chair.

442
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,040
Would you like some tea?

443
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Just water, thank you.
And maybe some butterscotch.

444
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,160
-What?
-Sorry, is that not a menu?

445
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,800
Gina, um...

446
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,040
Hi.

447
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,160
You know the handover's
not till 3:00?

448
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
-You're just a bit early...
-I've changed my mind.

449
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,840
-Ooh.
-It's too upsetting.

450
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,280
Mum needs to be able to look at the
urn and know that he's all there.

451
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,040
And he will be all there.
There's only gonna be like a ti...

452
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,160
It's like a pinch
is gonna be missing...

453
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,200
Those missing ashes
will be a constant reminder

454
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,680
of this annus horribilis -

455
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,480
the year some tramp
stole her husband

456
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,160
and put his ashes in a snow globe.

457
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,520
Oh, well, hang on,
we don't know that's gonna happen.

458
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,160
Thanks, George.
[softly] Get some tissues.

459
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,440
I mean, she might get a tattoo

460
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,360
or she might lose them.

461
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,040
We don't know what's gonna... Thanks.

462
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
-[whispers] No, tissues in a box!
-[whispers] We've run out.

463
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,360
Mum always thought he'd come to
his senses and come home eventually,

464
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,320
but then he...he died!

465
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,960
I know. I know.

466
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
[cries]
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

467
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,840
It's alright, she's just a bit upset

468
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,800
'cause we're...dividing
her dad's ashes today.

469
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,080
-No, we're not.
-[softly] Yes, we are.

470
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,280
Could you give us a minute?

471
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Oh, I'm sorry. Me.

472
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,040
-Now...
-[sighs]

473
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,840
...we're going to calm down.

474
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,400
I'm gonna get you some tissues.

475
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,760
You do know that's not a toilet.

476
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,560
She said that my dad...

477
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,600
-Yep.
-...is gonna end up tattooed...

478
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,960
I can assure you, Gina,
that is not going to happen.

479
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,400
Now, I want you
to just take a little minute.

480
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,480
Hmm?

481
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,800
Thank you.

482
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,200
Ok, you know I can't control
what Kellie-Joy does with the ashes

483
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,560
once she gets them.

484
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,840
Well, then you'd better make sure
she doesn't get any ashes.

485
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,560
Roz? Roz?

486
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,040
I can't get up.

487
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,000
[sighs]

488
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,520
Thank you so much
for your patience, Gina.

489
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,880
We'll see you back here at 3:00.

490
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,800
See you at 3:00.

491
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,240
Really, Helen?

492
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,640
A beanbag?

493
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,040
And toilet paper?
What were you thinking?!

494
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,280
Yeah, I made some really bad choices.

495
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,440
I'm gonna go pick up my stuff,
but you owe me, Webmaster.

496
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,080
See? This is why
I can't take time off, Raymond.

497
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,920
Toilet paper and a beanbag.
Good God!

498
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,240
Did someone
take a crap on a beanbag?

499
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,000
Was it not labelled?

500
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,880
You might want to
get onto that, Roz.

501
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,680
Oh, come on.

502
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,120
[tyres screech]

503
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,880
Alrighty.
Ooh, good. Is that Alan Munster?

504
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,200
Yep.
Great. I will take him.

505
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,800
And this is for you.
It's from the place downstairs.

506
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,240
-Thank you, George.
-Taste the deception.

507
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,640
All is forgiven. Uh...

508
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,800
Did you get the deli meats
and the lavash for the meeting?

509
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,280
Sure did.

510
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,600
Close enough.

511
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,440
And...I got this fancy cheeseboard.

512
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,560
Wow.

513
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,880
You're a real cheese wizard.

514
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
-Thank you.
-And that is dead-fancy.

515
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,200
Bob's gonna love that. Alright,
pop that in the meeting room.

516
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,680
I'll deal with Alan.

517
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
Cheese?

518
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,440
[speaks inaudibly]

519
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,520
[speaks inaudibly]

520
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,800
[tram bell rings]

521
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,680
Ugh...don't you even speak to me!
Don't panic, no, don't panic.

522
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,480
-Where is Roz?!
-No, don't tell...

523
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,880
Don't' tell Roz, don't tell Roz.

524
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,960
I won't be paying my bill. You
promised me this wouldn't happen.

525
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,560
Gina, I am so sorry.

526
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,280
Helen, I thought
you were gonna sort this out.

527
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,520
-I did!
-You didn't.

528
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,080
You gave that woman
five grams of my father's ashes.

529
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,360
I gave that woman
five grams of ashes.

530
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,720
I did not give her
your father's ashes.

531
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,720
What?

532
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,680
Oh, my God, Helen,
what have you done?

533
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,640
You said, "Helen, you better not
give that woman any of her ashes."

534
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Yes. And I meant you had better
construct a solid legal argument

535
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,520
for not handing over any ashes.

536
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,000
Ok. Well, I realise that now.

537
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,360
At the time,
it did sound a lot more like,

538
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
"Helen, you better not
give her any of those ashes,

539
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,120
"if you know what I mean." Wink-wink.

540
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,280
Is that supposed to be me?

541
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,720
OK, get ready to say,
"Well done, Helen,"

542
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,280
because that's not Dad.

543
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
[gasps softly]

544
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,920
Here he is!

545
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,600
All of him!

546
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,280
But what...what if she
has the ashes you gave her tested?

547
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,160
Oh, it doesn't matter - bone is bone.

548
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,880
-Bone?
-Oh, my God, is that another person?

549
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,680
No, of course it isn't.

550
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,560
Sorry, can I just say? This is not
how I thought this was gonna go.

551
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,400
I genuinely thought
everyone would be really happy.

552
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,200
I mean...there's your dad.

553
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,360
Every last gram of him. All for you.

554
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,840
You're welcome.

555
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,000
Good result.

556
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,480
Thank you, Roz. Finally.

557
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,600
Do I need to be worried?

558
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,200
Oh...maybe.

559
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,320
George put it together,
so I don't know how stable it is.

560
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,240
About the ashes you gave Kellie-Joy.

561
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,880
No, I think we're good.
Human bone, animal bone...

562
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,200
Animal? Oh, no, Fisk,
you didn't kill your cat?

563
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,720
I don't have a cat.

564
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,960
Anymore.

565
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,720
-It wasn't a cat.
-Was it a dog?

566
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,640
-It wasn't a...
-You know what? I don't wanna know.

567
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,600
Guinea pig?

568
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,120
-Why do I even...
-Don't tell me.

569
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,240
Don't make me complicit.
Was it a pigeon?

570
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,680
It wasn't a pigeon.
OK, you know what?

571
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,480
Let's just say if she wants to get
a tattoo she should get a possum,

572
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,280
a mangy one with a head wound.

573
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,760
Well, let's leave it at that.

574
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,800
No, Helen!
[screams]

575
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,680
-Don't drink that!
-Why not?!

576
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,720
Oh, I got you this good coffee,
just...from downstairs.
