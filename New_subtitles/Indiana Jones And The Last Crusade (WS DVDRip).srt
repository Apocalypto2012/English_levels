1
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,912
Dismount!

2
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:07,621
Herman's horse-sick!

3
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:17,254
Chaps, no one wander off.

4
00:02:17,332 --> 00:02:20,495
Some of the passageways
in here can run for miles.

5
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:33,906
I don't think
this is such a good idea.

6
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:39,081
What is it?

7
00:03:04,246 --> 00:03:05,838
Alfred, did you
get anything yet?

8
00:03:05,914 --> 00:03:06,846
Nothing.

9
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:07,904
Then keep digging.

10
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:08,950
The kid's got something!

11
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:11,679
Whoo! Yee-hoo!

12
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:12,742
I got something, Garth!

13
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:15,381
I got something...
I got something right here.

14
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:23,487
Oh, look at that!

15
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:24,725
Whoo!

16
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,767
We're rich! We're rich!

17
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:27,631
Shut up. Shut up.

18
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:28,930
Well, we're rich, ain't we?

19
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:33,635
Indy...

20
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,970
Indy?

21
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:36,738
What are they doing?

22
00:03:36,812 --> 00:03:39,303
Indiana? Indiana?

23
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:41,212
Shh!

24
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:46,546
Hey, we got to find
more stuff to bring back.

25
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:48,612
It's the Cross of Coronado.

26
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,284
Cortez gave it to him
in 1520.

27
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:52,986
Ah! Oh, boy! Whoo!

28
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:55,529
I'm thinkin' about
raisin' my dead mama,

29
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:58,031
dig down and put it on
her bony finger!

30
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:00,533
That cross
is an important artifact.

31
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:02,194
It belongs in a museum.

32
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,828
Run back
and find the others.

33
00:04:03,905 --> 00:04:07,238
Tell Mr.Havelock that there are
men looting in the caves.

34
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:08,401
Have him bring
the sheriff.

35
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:10,308
It's only a snake.

36
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:12,073
Did you hear what I said?

37
00:04:12,147 --> 00:04:13,546
Right. Run back...

38
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:15,947
Mr.Havelock...
the sheriff...

39
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:18,212
What, what are you
gonna do?

40
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:19,480
I don't know.

41
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:21,181
I'll think
of something.

42
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:27,594
Dig with your hands,

43
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:29,061
not with your mouth.

44
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:45,605
He's got our thing!

45
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,341
- Get him!
- Get off me!

46
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,352
Mr.Havelock!

47
00:04:54,422 --> 00:04:55,354
Anybody!

48
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,550
Everybody's lost but me.

49
00:04:57,626 --> 00:04:58,718
There he is!

50
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:00,351
Let's go! Let's go!

51
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:18,708
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Dang it!

52
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:23,848
Hyah! Hyah!

53
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,908
Hey!

54
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:26,977
Come back here!

55
00:05:39,434 --> 00:05:40,731
Come on! Get him!

56
00:05:49,244 --> 00:05:50,802
Hey, come back here!

57
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:14,228
Oh!

58
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:42,627
Aah... Oh!

59
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:58,637
Here, let me.

60
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:05,916
Oh, oh...

61
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:38,717
Holy smokes!

62
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:03,635
Come on, kid.

63
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:07,642
There's no way out of this.

64
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:24,330
Hey!

65
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:42,081
Toss up the whip.

66
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:54,019
You got heart, kid,
but that belongs to me.

67
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:55,357
It belongs to Coronado.

68
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,692
Coronado is dead,

69
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:58,824
and so are all
of his grandchildren.

70
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,232
This should be in a museum.

71
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:02,291
Now give it back!

72
00:09:04,873 --> 00:09:07,307
A snake!

73
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,307
Snake! Aah!

74
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:09,570
Don't let him get away!

75
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,838
Magic?

76
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:15,815
Hold it.

77
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:17,681
Make sure he
doesn't double back.

78
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:36,765
Okay, kid,
out of the box, now.

79
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:39,538
Son of a...

80
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,276
Damn.

81
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:04,795
Dad!

82
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:09,128
Dad!

83
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,237
Dad.

84
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:13,405
Dad... Out.

85
00:10:13,474 --> 00:10:14,406
It's important.

86
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:16,102
Then wait.
Count to 20.

87
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:17,610
No, Dad. You listen to me.

88
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,611
Junior!

89
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,113
One, two, three, four...

90
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:22,115
In Greek.

91
00:10:33,695 --> 00:10:37,927
"May he who illuminated this...

92
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:39,830
illuminate me."

93
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:47,171
I brought the sheriff.

94
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:49,840
Just the man I want to see.

95
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:51,811
Now, there were five
or six of them...

96
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,904
- It's all right, son.
- They came after me...

97
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,107
You still got it?

98
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:55,342
Well, yes, sir.

99
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,940
It's right here.

100
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:58,679
I'm glad to see that...

101
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:01,688
because the rightful
owner of this cross

102
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:04,748
won't press charges
if you give it back.

103
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:08,318
He's got witnesses,
five or six of them.

104
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:21,472
Whoo! Yeah!

105
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:33,513
Good day.

106
00:11:38,593 --> 00:11:40,652
You lost today, kid,

107
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:44,494
but it doesn't mean
you have to like it.

108
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:12,951
Small world, Dr.Jones.

109
00:12:13,027 --> 00:12:15,257
Too small for two of us.

110
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:24,768
This is the second time

111
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,137
I've had to reclaim
my property from you.

112
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:29,368
That belongs in a museum.

113
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:32,140
So do you.

114
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,907
Throw him over the side.

115
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:24,196
Grab him, he's getting away!
Stop him!

116
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,479
Archaeology is the search

117
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:22,921
for fact...

118
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:26,920
...not truth.

119
00:14:26,994 --> 00:14:28,586
If it's truth
you're interested in,

120
00:14:28,663 --> 00:14:31,291
Dr.Tyree's philosophy class
is right down the hall.

121
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,132
So forget any ideas you've got

122
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:35,860
about lost cities,
exotic travel,

123
00:14:35,937 --> 00:14:37,131
and digging up the world.

124
00:14:37,238 --> 00:14:39,001
We do not follow maps
to buried treasure,

125
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:42,565
and "X" never, ever,
marks the spot.

126
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:47,477
Seventy percent
of all archaeology is done

127
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:48,810
in the library.

128
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:51,852
Research. Reading.

129
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,013
We cannot afford
to take mythology

130
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:56,522
at face value.

131
00:14:58,726 --> 00:15:00,421
Next week: "Egyptology."

132
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:02,793
Starting with the excavation
of Naukratis

133
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:04,388
by Flinders Petrie in 1885.

134
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:05,489
I will be in my office

135
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:06,931
if anybody's got
any problems,

136
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:08,332
for the next hour
and a half.

137
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:16,941
Marcus, I did it.

138
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:19,241
You've got it!

139
00:15:26,454 --> 00:15:28,786
Oh!

140
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:31,051
You know how long I've
been looking for that?

141
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,854
All your life.

142
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:34,417
All my life.

143
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:35,587
Well done, Indy.

144
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:37,324
Very well done, indeed.

145
00:15:37,398 --> 00:15:41,129
This will find a place of honor
in our Spanish collection.

146
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:43,134
We can discuss
my honorarium

147
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:45,536
over dinner and
champagne tonight.

148
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:46,766
Your treat.

149
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:48,138
Yes.

150
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:50,369
My treat.

151
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:55,709
Dr.Jones!
Dr.Jones!

152
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:01,153
Shush! Shush! Shush!

153
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:02,984
Dr.Jones, I am so glad
you're back.

154
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:04,354
Your mail is on your desk.

155
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:05,824
Here are your
phone messages.

156
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:07,417
Dr.Jones, you promised...

157
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:08,860
This is your
appointment schedule,

158
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,955
and these term papers still
haven't been graded.

159
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:12,863
Okay. Irene,
put everybody's name on a list,

160
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:14,094
get the order they arrived...

161
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:15,328
Oh, come on, Dr.Jones.

162
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:16,495
Dr.Jones.

163
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:19,096
...and I'll see each
and every one of them...

164
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:20,640
in turn.

165
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:34,587
"Venice, Italy."

166
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:05,049
Dr.Jones!

167
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:12,359
Dr.Jones?

168
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:31,372
I trust your trip down
was comfortable, Dr.Jones.

169
00:17:31,445 --> 00:17:34,414
Uh, my men didn't alarm you,
I hope.

170
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:36,416
My name is Donovan.

171
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:37,576
Walter Donovan.

172
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:38,880
I know who you are,
Mr.Donovan.

173
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:40,250
Your contributions
to the museum

174
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:42,118
over the years have
been extremely generous.

175
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:43,348
Some of the pieces

176
00:17:43,424 --> 00:17:45,255
in your collection here
are very impressive.

177
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:47,055
Well, like yourself,
Dr.Jones,

178
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:48,925
I have a passion
for antiquities.

179
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:50,964
Have a look over here.

180
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,468
This might interest you.

181
00:17:57,505 --> 00:17:59,473
Well, it's sandstone.

182
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,132
Christian symbol.

183
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:03,073
Early Latin text.

184
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:05,645
Mid-12th century,
I should think.

185
00:18:05,713 --> 00:18:07,647
That was our
assessment, as well.

186
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:09,080
Where did this come from?

187
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,447
My engineers
unearthed it

188
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:12,577
in the mountain region
north of Ankara

189
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:14,086
while excavating
for copper.

190
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:16,121
Can you translate
the inscription?

191
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:22,929
"...who drinks the water
I shall give him, says the Lord,

192
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:26,262
"will have a... spring

193
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:29,826
"inside him welling up
for eternal life.

194
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:34,404
"Let them bring me
to your holy mountain

195
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:36,238
"in the place where you dwell.

196
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,402
"Across the desert

197
00:18:37,478 --> 00:18:39,503
"and through the mountain

198
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,605
"to the Canyon
of the Crescent Moon,

199
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:44,776
to the temple
where the cup that..."

200
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:50,453
"Where the cup
that holds the blood

201
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:54,392
of Jesus Christ resides
forever."

202
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:58,125
The Holy Grail, Dr.Jones.

203
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:02,192
The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.

204
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:05,500
The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion

205
00:19:05,573 --> 00:19:09,270
and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.

206
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:11,277
The Arthur legend.

207
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:14,075
I've heard this
bedtime story before.

208
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:15,477
Eternal life, Dr.Jones!

209
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:17,881
The gift of youth to whoever
drinks from the Grail.

210
00:19:19,086 --> 00:19:21,611
Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.

211
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:22,713
An old man's dream.

212
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,485
Every man's dream,

213
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:26,583
including your
father's, I believe.

214
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,664
Grail lore is his hobby.

215
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:33,723
He's a teacher
of medieval literature.

216
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:35,996
The one the students hope
they don't get.

217
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,096
Walter, you're neglecting
your guests.

218
00:19:39,173 --> 00:19:41,733
Be along in a moment, dear.

219
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:48,975
Hard to resist, isn't it?

220
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:52,416
The Holy Grail's final resting
place described in detail.

221
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:54,579
What good is it?

222
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:56,646
This grail tablet
speaks of deserts

223
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:58,351
and mountains and canyons.

224
00:19:58,426 --> 00:19:59,518
It's pretty vague.

225
00:19:59,593 --> 00:20:01,527
Where do you want
to start looking?

226
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:04,359
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

227
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,059
but the entire top portion
is missing.

228
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,122
Just the same, an attempt

229
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:09,134
to recover the Grail
is currently underway.

230
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:15,267
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr.Jones.

231
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:18,243
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

232
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:20,872
it disappeared, and was lost
for a thousand years

233
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:22,279
before it was found again

234
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:24,340
by three knights
of the First Crusade.

235
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:25,942
Three brothers, to be exact.

236
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,988
I've heard this one, as well.

237
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:31,855
Two of these brothers walked
out of the desert 150 years

238
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,826
after having found the Grail

239
00:20:33,894 --> 00:20:36,795
and began the long journey
back to France,

240
00:20:36,864 --> 00:20:38,889
but only one of them made it.

241
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:41,434
And before dying
of extreme old age,

242
00:20:41,502 --> 00:20:43,663
he supposedly imparted
his tale

243
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:46,433
to a... to a Franciscan friar,
I think.

244
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:49,635
Not "supposedly,"
Dr.Jones.

245
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,041
This is the manuscript

246
00:20:51,111 --> 00:20:54,103
in which the friar chronicled
the knight's story.

247
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:55,705
It doesn't reveal

248
00:20:55,783 --> 00:20:57,375
the location of the Grail,
I'm afraid,

249
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:58,509
but the knight promised

250
00:20:58,586 --> 00:21:00,884
that two markers, that had been
left behind, would.

251
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:03,822
This tablet is one
of those markers.

252
00:21:03,891 --> 00:21:06,883
It proves
the knight's story is true.

253
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:09,020
But as you pointed out,
it's incomplete.

254
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:10,859
Now, the second marker
is entombed

255
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:12,592
with the knight's dead brother.

256
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,258
Our project leader

257
00:21:14,335 --> 00:21:16,326
believes that tomb to be located

258
00:21:16,403 --> 00:21:18,428
within the city
of Venice, Italy.

259
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:22,999
As you can now see,
Dr.Jones,

260
00:21:23,077 --> 00:21:26,137
we're about
to complete a great quest

261
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,147
that began almost
2,000 years ago.

262
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,683
We're only one step away.

263
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:33,151
That's usually
when the ground falls out

264
00:21:33,254 --> 00:21:34,881
from underneath your feet.

265
00:21:34,955 --> 00:21:37,583
You could be more right
than you know.

266
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:38,955
Yes?

267
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:41,358
We've hit a snag.

268
00:21:41,428 --> 00:21:43,988
Our project leader has vanished,

269
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,157
along with all his research.

270
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:47,529
Uh, we received a cable

271
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:49,432
from his colleague,
Dr.Schneider,

272
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:51,368
who has no idea
of his whereabouts

273
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:52,769
or what's become of him.

274
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,401
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

275
00:21:56,477 --> 00:22:00,880
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

276
00:22:00,948 --> 00:22:03,382
You've got
the wrong Jones,

277
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,781
Mr.Donovan.

278
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:08,120
Why don't you try my father?

279
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:10,122
We already have.

280
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,681
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

281
00:22:23,837 --> 00:22:26,328
Your father and I have been
friends since time began.

282
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:27,669
I've watched you grow up, Indy.

283
00:22:27,741 --> 00:22:29,333
I've watched
the two of you grow apart.

284
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,571
I've never seen you this
concerned about him before.

285
00:22:31,645 --> 00:22:33,909
Dad?

286
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:35,141
He's an academic;
a bookworm.

287
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:36,341
He's not a field man.

288
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:38,351
Dad? Dad?

289
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:40,649
Dear God.

290
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:45,950
What has the old fool
got himself into now?

291
00:22:46,026 --> 00:22:47,960
I don't know,

292
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:50,622
but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

293
00:22:50,698 --> 00:22:52,632
Dad?

294
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,395
It's today's mail,

295
00:22:54,468 --> 00:22:56,663
and it's been opened.

296
00:22:57,738 --> 00:22:59,672
Mail.

297
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,708
That's it, Marcus.

298
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:05,702
Venice, Italy.

299
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:10,642
What is it?

300
00:23:13,187 --> 00:23:15,155
It's Dad's Grail diary.

301
00:23:16,924 --> 00:23:18,551
Every clue he followed.

302
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:20,025
Every discovery he made.

303
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:23,154
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

304
00:23:24,665 --> 00:23:26,758
This is his whole life.

305
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:29,029
Why would he have
sent this to me?

306
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:30,900
I don't know,

307
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:34,737
but someone must want it
pretty badly.

308
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,778
Do you believe, Marcus?

309
00:23:57,598 --> 00:24:01,398
Do you believe
the Grail actually exists?

310
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:03,766
The search for the Cup of Christ

311
00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:06,863
is the search for the divine
in all of us.

312
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,567
But if you want facts, Indy,

313
00:24:08,642 --> 00:24:10,041
I've none to give you.

314
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,668
At my age, I'm prepared

315
00:24:11,745 --> 00:24:13,838
to take a few
things on faith.

316
00:24:19,687 --> 00:24:21,621
Call Donovan, Marcus.

317
00:24:21,689 --> 00:24:23,748
Tell him I'll take
that ticket to Venice now.

318
00:24:26,193 --> 00:24:28,457
I'll tell him
we'll take two.

319
00:24:33,534 --> 00:24:36,002
All right, tell me what's going
to happen when we get to Venice.

320
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,334
Don't worry, Dr.Schneider
will be there to meet you.

321
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:39,667
- Uh, Schneider?
- I maintain

322
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,401
an apartment in Venice.
It's at your disposal.

323
00:24:41,475 --> 00:24:42,567
Oh, well, that's good.

324
00:24:42,643 --> 00:24:44,611
Thank you.

325
00:24:45,646 --> 00:24:47,580
Dr.Jones... good luck.

326
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:49,411
Now be very careful.

327
00:24:49,483 --> 00:24:51,576
Don't trust anybody.

328
00:25:25,185 --> 00:25:26,277
Signora?

329
00:25:26,353 --> 00:25:28,480
Signorina?

330
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:36,462
Ah, Venice...

331
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,758
Yes.

332
00:25:37,831 --> 00:25:40,299
Uh, how will we recognize
this Dr.Schneider

333
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:41,527
when we see him?

334
00:25:41,602 --> 00:25:43,536
I don't know.

335
00:25:43,604 --> 00:25:44,901
Maybe he'll know us.

336
00:25:44,972 --> 00:25:47,805
Dr.Jones?

337
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:48,967
Yes?

338
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:51,237
I knew it was you.

339
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:54,303
You have your father's eyes.

340
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:59,716
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

341
00:25:59,787 --> 00:26:02,915
Looks like the best parts have
already been spoken for.

342
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,548
Marcus Brody?

343
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,252
That's right.

344
00:26:06,326 --> 00:26:07,623
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

345
00:26:07,694 --> 00:26:08,922
Oh, how do you do?

346
00:26:08,996 --> 00:26:12,090
The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.

347
00:26:12,232 --> 00:26:13,096
He was very close

348
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:15,201
to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

349
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,066
I've never seen him so excited.

350
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:18,934
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

351
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:20,940
Who? Attila
the Professor?

352
00:26:21,008 --> 00:26:22,441
He was never giddy,

353
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:24,704
even when he was
a schoolboy.

354
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:27,838
Fraulein, will
you permit me?

355
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:29,007
I usually don't.

356
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:30,413
I usually
don't, either.

357
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:31,610
In that case,
I permit you.

358
00:26:31,685 --> 00:26:32,811
It would make
me very happy.

359
00:26:32,886 --> 00:26:33,818
But I'm already sad.

360
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:35,218
By tomorrow,
it will have faded.

361
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:36,620
Tomorrow I'll
steal you another.

362
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,987
I hate to interrupt you,

363
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:39,286
but the reason
we're here...

364
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,792
Yes. I have something
to show you.

365
00:26:40,861 --> 00:26:42,692
I left your father working
in the library.

366
00:26:42,763 --> 00:26:44,025
He sent me to the map section

367
00:26:44,097 --> 00:26:45,689
to fetch an ancient plan
of the city.

368
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:47,961
When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

369
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:50,230
except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.

370
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:52,272
Roman numerals.

371
00:26:52,372 --> 00:26:54,363
Here is the library.

372
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:56,932
That doesn't look much
like a library.

373
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,706
Looks like a
converted church.

374
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,714
In this case,
it's the literal truth.

375
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:03,647
We are on holy ground.

376
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:05,184
These columns over here

377
00:27:05,252 --> 00:27:07,379
were brought back
as spoils of war

378
00:27:07,454 --> 00:27:10,719
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

379
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:12,258
Now, please excuse me.

380
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:14,954
The library's closing
in a few moments.

381
00:27:15,028 --> 00:27:17,895
I'll arrange for us
to stay a little longer.

382
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:24,369
Marcus... I've seen
this window before.

383
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:25,871
Where?

384
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:28,464
Right here,
in Dad's diary.

385
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:37,443
You see?

386
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:39,041
Look, Indy.

387
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,110
The Roman numerals.

388
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:43,520
Dad was onto something here.

389
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,490
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

390
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,288
but we still don't know
what they mean.

391
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:49,522
Dad sent me this
diary for a reason.

392
00:27:49,596 --> 00:27:50,688
Until we find
out why,

393
00:27:50,764 --> 00:27:52,129
I suggest we keep
it to ourselves.

394
00:27:52,232 --> 00:27:53,324
Find something?

395
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,958
Uh, yes.
Three, seven and ten.

396
00:27:55,035 --> 00:27:56,866
That window seems
to be the source

397
00:27:56,937 --> 00:27:58,131
of the Roman numerals.

398
00:27:58,205 --> 00:27:59,604
My God,
I must be blind.

399
00:27:59,673 --> 00:28:02,540
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

400
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:04,474
he was looking
for the tomb itself.

401
00:28:04,544 --> 00:28:05,977
Don't you get it?

402
00:28:06,046 --> 00:28:07,775
The tomb is somewhere
in the library.

403
00:28:07,848 --> 00:28:09,782
You said yourself
it used to be a church.

404
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,078
Look.

405
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:13,449
Three.

406
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:16,689
Three.

407
00:28:16,757 --> 00:28:17,917
Seven.

408
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:20,551
Seven. Ten.

409
00:28:20,627 --> 00:28:22,562
And ten.

410
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:25,189
Now where's the ten?

411
00:28:25,265 --> 00:28:27,825
Look around for the ten.

412
00:28:35,475 --> 00:28:39,002
Three and seven.

413
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,047
Seven and seven

414
00:28:41,114 --> 00:28:43,480
and ten.

415
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:04,760
Ten.

416
00:29:04,838 --> 00:29:08,501
"X" marks the spot.

417
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:07,055
Bingo.

418
00:30:07,134 --> 00:30:08,726
You don't disappoint,
Dr.Jones.

419
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:10,429
You're a great deal
like your father.

420
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:12,131
Except he's lost,
and I'm not.

421
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:13,331
Lower me down.

422
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,541
Look after this for me,
will you?

423
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:40,924
Come on.

424
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:50,066
Pagan symbols.

425
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:51,440
Fourth or fifth century.

426
00:30:51,511 --> 00:30:52,603
Right.

427
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,443
600 years before
the Crusades.

428
00:30:55,515 --> 00:30:57,881
The Christians would have
dug their own passages

429
00:30:57,951 --> 00:30:59,714
and burial chambers
centuries later.

430
00:30:59,786 --> 00:31:01,276
That's right.

431
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:03,618
If there's a knight of
the First Crusade down here,

432
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,658
that's where we'll find him.

433
00:31:37,624 --> 00:31:38,716
What's this one?

434
00:31:39,793 --> 00:31:40,817
The Ark of the Covenant.

435
00:31:40,894 --> 00:31:41,952
Are you sure?

436
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:43,427
Pretty sure.

437
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:02,446
Watch out.

438
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:19,359
It's petroleum.

439
00:32:19,432 --> 00:32:22,196
I should sink
a well down here and retire.

440
00:32:38,785 --> 00:32:40,218
Give me the lighter.

441
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:51,989
Oh, rats.

442
00:32:52,065 --> 00:32:53,089
Ugh!

443
00:33:07,948 --> 00:33:09,677
Come on.

444
00:33:58,365 --> 00:33:59,662
Come here.

445
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,704
Look, it...

446
00:34:09,776 --> 00:34:10,868
it must be one of these.

447
00:34:10,944 --> 00:34:12,104
Look at the artistry

448
00:34:12,212 --> 00:34:15,773
of these carvings,
and the scrollwork.

449
00:34:30,997 --> 00:34:33,329
It's this one.

450
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,143
This is it.

451
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,615
We found it.

452
00:34:53,987 --> 00:34:55,045
Look.

453
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,681
The engraving on the shield,

454
00:34:58,758 --> 00:35:01,852
it's the same
as on the Grail tablet.

455
00:35:03,363 --> 00:35:05,194
The shield is the second marker.

456
00:35:05,265 --> 00:35:06,755
What's that?

457
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:08,767
It's a rubbing

458
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:11,770
Dad made
of the Grail tablet.

459
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:14,398
Just like your father--
giddy as a schoolboy.

460
00:35:15,508 --> 00:35:17,032
Wouldn't it be wonderful

461
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,169
if he were here now
to see this?

462
00:35:20,747 --> 00:35:22,874
He never would have
made it past the rats.

463
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:24,109
He hates rats.

464
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,514
He's scared to death of them.

465
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,905
Get back!

466
00:35:48,975 --> 00:35:50,533
Back against the wall.

467
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:56,111
Quick! Under it!

468
00:35:56,182 --> 00:35:57,547
Air pocket!

469
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:04,622
Don't wander off.

470
00:36:04,691 --> 00:36:05,715
What?

471
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,020
What?!

472
00:36:25,945 --> 00:36:27,606
I think I've found
a way out.

473
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,147
Deep breath.

474
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:48,627
Ah, Venice.

475
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:21,930
Whoa!

476
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:56,859
Are you crazy?!
Don't go between them!

477
00:37:56,936 --> 00:37:59,837
Go between them?
Are you crazy?!

478
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,240
I said go around!

479
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:14,081
You said
go between them!

480
00:38:14,187 --> 00:38:16,348
I said,
don't go between them!

481
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:20,581
No!

482
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:27,883
Why are you
trying to kill us?

483
00:39:27,961 --> 00:39:29,519
Because you're looking
for the Holy Grail.

484
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:31,826
My father was looking
for the Holy Grail.

485
00:39:31,898 --> 00:39:33,024
Did you kill him too?

486
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:34,031
No.

487
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,829
Where is he?

488
00:39:35,902 --> 00:39:38,370
Talk or you're dead.

489
00:39:38,438 --> 00:39:40,030
Damn it, tell me!

490
00:39:40,106 --> 00:39:41,334
Tell me!

491
00:39:41,407 --> 00:39:44,035
If you don't let go, Dr.Jones,
we'll both die.

492
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,101
Then we'll die.

493
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:49,214
My soul is prepared.
How's yours?

494
00:39:50,883 --> 00:39:52,441
This is your last chance.

495
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:55,510
No, Dr.Jones, it's yours.

496
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,903
All right, where's my father?

497
00:40:13,973 --> 00:40:16,737
If you let me go,
I will tell you where he is.

498
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:18,674
Who are you?

499
00:40:18,745 --> 00:40:20,679
My name is Kazim.

500
00:40:20,747 --> 00:40:22,237
And why were you
trying to kill me?

501
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:24,044
The secret of the Grail

502
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:26,449
has been safe
for a thousand years,

503
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,419
and for all that time,

504
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:30,956
the Brotherhood of
the Cruciform Sword

505
00:40:31,024 --> 00:40:35,825
have been prepared
to do anything to keep it safe.

506
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:39,097
Let me off
at this jetty.

507
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:46,604
Ask yourself, why do you
seek the Cup of Christ?

508
00:40:46,673 --> 00:40:50,006
Is it for His glory,
or for yours?

509
00:40:50,076 --> 00:40:52,704
I didn't come
for the Cup of Christ.

510
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:54,679
I came to find my father.

511
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:58,148
In that case,
God be with you in your quest.

512
00:40:58,217 --> 00:41:01,084
Your father is being held
in the Castle of Brunwald,

513
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:03,520
on the Austrian-German border.

514
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:13,630
How's the head?

515
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,430
It's better,
now I've seen this.

516
00:41:16,502 --> 00:41:18,766
It's the name of a city.

517
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:20,396
"Alexandretta"?

518
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:23,073
Hmm...

519
00:41:23,142 --> 00:41:25,007
The knights of the First Crusade

520
00:41:25,078 --> 00:41:28,275
laid siege to the city
of Alexandretta for over a year.

521
00:41:28,347 --> 00:41:30,975
The entire city was destroyed.

522
00:41:32,985 --> 00:41:36,682
The present city of Iskenderun
is built on its ruins.

523
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:40,888
Marcus, you remember
what the Grail tablet said:

524
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,428
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

525
00:41:43,496 --> 00:41:45,623
to the Canyon
of the Crescent Moon."

526
00:41:48,668 --> 00:41:50,795
But where exactly?

527
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,531
Your father would know.

528
00:41:52,605 --> 00:41:53,537
Mm.

529
00:41:53,606 --> 00:41:56,040
Your father did know.

530
00:41:56,109 --> 00:41:57,633
Look. He made a map.

531
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,473
He must have
pieced it together

532
00:41:59,545 --> 00:42:00,876
from clues
scattered through

533
00:42:00,947 --> 00:42:02,744
the whole history
of the Grail quest.

534
00:42:02,815 --> 00:42:03,941
A map with no names.

535
00:42:04,016 --> 00:42:05,677
Now, he knew there
was a city

536
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:07,447
with an oasis
due east, here.

537
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,509
He knew the course

538
00:42:08,588 --> 00:42:10,385
turned south through
the desert to a river,

539
00:42:10,456 --> 00:42:12,287
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

540
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:13,825
Straight to the canyon.

541
00:42:13,893 --> 00:42:16,361
He knew everything
except where to begin,

542
00:42:16,429 --> 00:42:18,056
the name of the city.

543
00:42:20,032 --> 00:42:21,590
Alexandretta.

544
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:22,656
Now we know.

545
00:42:22,735 --> 00:42:24,134
Yes. Now we know.

546
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,635
Marcus, get hold of Sallah.

547
00:42:25,705 --> 00:42:27,104
Tell him to meet you
in Iskenderun.

548
00:42:27,173 --> 00:42:28,140
What about you?

549
00:42:28,207 --> 00:42:29,606
I'm going after Dad.

550
00:42:50,997 --> 00:42:52,965
Elsa?

551
00:42:58,137 --> 00:43:01,072
Elsa? Elsa?

552
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,937
Oh! Oh...

553
00:43:11,284 --> 00:43:12,581
My room...

554
00:43:12,652 --> 00:43:14,415
Mine, too.

555
00:43:14,487 --> 00:43:16,250
What were they
looking for?

556
00:43:16,322 --> 00:43:17,789
This.

557
00:43:17,857 --> 00:43:19,347
The Grail diary?

558
00:43:19,425 --> 00:43:20,949
Uh-huh.

559
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:22,824
You had it?

560
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:24,726
You didn't trust me.

561
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:26,788
I didn't know you.

562
00:43:26,866 --> 00:43:29,733
At least I let you tag along.

563
00:43:29,802 --> 00:43:30,996
Oh, yes.

564
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,903
Give them a flower,
and they'll follow you anywhere.

565
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:37,299
Knock it off. You're not mad.

566
00:43:37,376 --> 00:43:38,843
No?

567
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:41,141
No. You like
the way I do things.

568
00:43:41,247 --> 00:43:44,273
It's lucky I don't do
things the same way.

569
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,978
You'd still be standing
at the Venice pier!

570
00:43:47,053 --> 00:43:49,578
Look, what do you think
is going on here?

571
00:43:49,655 --> 00:43:52,681
Since I met you,
I've nearly been incinerated,

572
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:55,556
drowned, shot at,
and chopped into fish bait.

573
00:43:55,628 --> 00:43:58,153
We're caught in the middle
of something sinister here.

574
00:43:58,231 --> 00:44:00,859
My guess is Dad found out
more than he was looking for.

575
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:01,865
And until I'm sure,

576
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:03,492
I'm going to
continue to do things

577
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:05,366
the way I think
they should be done.

578
00:44:08,808 --> 00:44:12,005
How dare you kiss me!

579
00:44:17,383 --> 00:44:20,716
Leave me alone.
I don't like fast women.

580
00:44:20,786 --> 00:44:22,253
And I hate...

581
00:44:22,321 --> 00:44:25,722
arrogant men.

582
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:36,691
Ah, Venice.

583
00:45:08,768 --> 00:45:11,100
What do you know
about this place?

584
00:45:11,203 --> 00:45:14,604
I know the Brunwalds
are famous art collectors.

585
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:17,936
What are you going to do?

586
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,102
Don't know.

587
00:45:19,178 --> 00:45:20,475
I'll think of something.

588
00:45:28,387 --> 00:45:29,718
Yes?

589
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:31,450
And not before time!

590
00:45:31,524 --> 00:45:32,582
Did you intend to leave us

591
00:45:32,658 --> 00:45:33,989
standing on
the doorstep all day?

592
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,027
We're drenched!

593
00:45:36,762 --> 00:45:38,889
Now look, I've gone
and caught a sniffle.

594
00:45:38,965 --> 00:45:40,057
Are you expected?

595
00:45:40,132 --> 00:45:42,464
Do not take that tone
with me, my good man.

596
00:45:42,535 --> 00:45:44,560
Now buttle off
and tell Baron Brunwald

597
00:45:44,637 --> 00:45:47,765
that Lord Clarence MacDonald
and his lovely assistant...

598
00:45:49,108 --> 00:45:51,372
...are here to view
the tapestries.

599
00:45:51,444 --> 00:45:52,502
Tapestries?

600
00:45:52,578 --> 00:45:54,273
Dear me,
the man is dense.

601
00:45:54,347 --> 00:45:56,144
This is a castle,
isn't it?

602
00:45:56,215 --> 00:45:57,648
There are tapestries?

603
00:45:57,717 --> 00:45:59,810
This is a castle,

604
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:02,479
and we have
many tapestries.

605
00:46:02,555 --> 00:46:05,023
But if you are
a Scottish lord,

606
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:08,026
then I am Mickey Mouse!

607
00:46:08,094 --> 00:46:10,187
How dare he?

608
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:39,588
Nazis. I hate these guys.

609
00:46:52,438 --> 00:46:54,599
This one. I think
he's in here.

610
00:46:54,673 --> 00:46:55,799
How do you know?

611
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:57,968
Because it's wired.

612
00:47:25,871 --> 00:47:28,339
Indy? Indy?

613
00:47:28,407 --> 00:47:31,240
Don't worry...
this is kid's play.

614
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:32,971
I'll be right back.

615
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:58,497
Junior?

616
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:00,869
Yes, sir.

617
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,271
It is you, Junior!

618
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:04,434
Don't call me that,
please.

619
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,842
Well, what are you
doing here?

620
00:48:06,912 --> 00:48:08,539
I came to get you.
What do you thi...?

621
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:21,817
Late 14th century,
Ming dynasty.

622
00:48:21,894 --> 00:48:24,260
Oh, it breaks the heart.

623
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,924
And the head.
You hit me, Dad.

624
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:29,297
I'll never forgive myself.

625
00:48:29,368 --> 00:48:31,768
Don't worry, I'm fine.

626
00:48:31,837 --> 00:48:34,032
Thank God.

627
00:48:37,009 --> 00:48:40,001
It's fake.

628
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,413
See, you can tell
by the cross section.

629
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:45,578
No!

630
00:48:45,651 --> 00:48:46,777
Dad, get your stuff.

631
00:48:46,852 --> 00:48:48,479
We've got to get
out of here.

632
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:50,852
Well, I'm sorry about
your head, though,

633
00:48:50,923 --> 00:48:52,948
but I thought you
were one of them.

634
00:48:53,025 --> 00:48:55,516
Dad, they come in
through the doors.

635
00:48:56,562 --> 00:48:57,586
Good point.

636
00:48:57,663 --> 00:49:00,063
But better safe
than sorry.

637
00:49:00,132 --> 00:49:01,997
Hmm, so I was wrong this time.

638
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:05,503
But, by God, I wasn't wrong
when I mailed you my diary.

639
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:06,868
You obviously got it.

640
00:49:08,807 --> 00:49:11,367
I got it, and I used it.

641
00:49:11,443 --> 00:49:14,879
We found the entrance
to the catacombs.

642
00:49:14,947 --> 00:49:16,414
Through the library?

643
00:49:16,482 --> 00:49:18,382
Right.

644
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,445
I knew it.

645
00:49:23,522 --> 00:49:25,080
And the tomb of Sir Richard?

646
00:49:25,157 --> 00:49:27,785
Found it.

647
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:31,125
He was actually there?

648
00:49:32,998 --> 00:49:34,590
You saw him?

649
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:37,636
Well, what was
left of him.

650
00:49:37,703 --> 00:49:39,568
And his shield...

651
00:49:39,638 --> 00:49:44,075
the inscription on
Sir Richard's shield?

652
00:49:44,143 --> 00:49:46,111
"Alexandretta."

653
00:49:46,212 --> 00:49:48,476
Alexandretta! Of course!

654
00:49:48,547 --> 00:49:52,779
On the pilgrim trail
from the Eastern Empire.

655
00:49:52,851 --> 00:49:53,818
Oh...

656
00:49:53,886 --> 00:49:57,788
Junior, you did it.

657
00:49:57,856 --> 00:50:00,120
No, Dad. You did.

658
00:50:00,192 --> 00:50:01,819
Forty years.

659
00:50:01,894 --> 00:50:05,022
Oh, if only I could have been
with you.

660
00:50:05,097 --> 00:50:06,928
There were rats,
Dad.

661
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:08,296
Rats?

662
00:50:08,367 --> 00:50:09,629
Yeah, big ones.

663
00:50:09,702 --> 00:50:12,296
What do the Nazis
want with you, Dad?

664
00:50:12,371 --> 00:50:13,531
They wanted my diary.

665
00:50:13,606 --> 00:50:14,937
Yeah?

666
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:18,408
I knew I had to get that book
as far away from me

667
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:19,910
as I possibly could.

668
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,839
Yeah.

669
00:50:28,087 --> 00:50:29,748
Dr.Jones.

670
00:50:29,822 --> 00:50:31,119
Yes?

671
00:50:33,626 --> 00:50:35,924
I will take the book now.

672
00:50:35,995 --> 00:50:39,453
What book?

673
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:41,931
You have the diary
in your pocket.

674
00:50:42,001 --> 00:50:45,596
You dolt!

675
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:47,605
Do you think my son
would be that stupid

676
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:49,641
that he would
bring my diary

677
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:51,300
all the way back here?

678
00:50:52,378 --> 00:50:54,005
You didn't, did you?

679
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,445
You didn't bring it,
did you?

680
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:57,447
Well, uh...

681
00:50:57,516 --> 00:50:59,347
You did.

682
00:50:59,418 --> 00:51:01,386
Look, can we
discuss this later?

683
00:51:01,453 --> 00:51:03,444
I should have mailed it
to the Marx Brothers.

684
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:05,456
Will you take it easy?

685
00:51:05,524 --> 00:51:06,821
Take it easy?!

686
00:51:06,892 --> 00:51:07,881
Why do you think
I sent it home

687
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,892
in the first place?

688
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:10,394
So it wouldn't fall
into their hands!

689
00:51:10,462 --> 00:51:12,555
I came here
to save you!

690
00:51:12,631 --> 00:51:13,563
Oh, yeah?

691
00:51:13,632 --> 00:51:16,328
And who's gonna come
to save you, Junior?

692
00:51:16,402 --> 00:51:17,460
I told you...

693
00:51:24,443 --> 00:51:26,877
...don't call me Junior!

694
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,140
Look what you did!

695
00:51:33,118 --> 00:51:35,211
I can't believe what you did...

696
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:39,657
Elsa? Elsa?

697
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:42,319
That's far enough.
Put down the gun, Dr.Jones.

698
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:43,656
Put down the gun,
or the fraulein dies.

699
00:51:43,729 --> 00:51:44,661
But she's one of them.

700
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,027
Indy, please!

701
00:51:46,098 --> 00:51:47,030
She's a Nazi.

702
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:48,031
What?!

703
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,725
Trust me.

704
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:50,496
- Indy, no!
- I will kill her!

705
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:51,900
Yeah? Go ahead!

706
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:53,164
No! Don't shoot!

707
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:55,399
Don't worry. He won't.

708
00:51:55,474 --> 00:51:57,499
Indy, please! Do what he says!

709
00:51:57,576 --> 00:52:00,067
And don't listen to her.

710
00:52:00,145 --> 00:52:02,010
Enough! She dies!

711
00:52:02,081 --> 00:52:05,448
Wait! Wait...

712
00:52:10,789 --> 00:52:12,723
I'm sorry.

713
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:16,852
No, don't be.

714
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:32,237
But... you should have
listened to your father.

715
00:52:49,528 --> 00:52:51,428
She ransacked her own room,

716
00:52:51,497 --> 00:52:53,294
and I fell for it.

717
00:52:53,365 --> 00:52:56,562
How did you know
she was a Nazi?

718
00:52:56,635 --> 00:52:57,567
Hmm?

719
00:52:57,636 --> 00:53:00,628
How did you know
she was a Nazi?

720
00:53:00,706 --> 00:53:03,334
She talks in her sleep.

721
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:15,582
I didn't trust her.
Why did you?

722
00:53:15,654 --> 00:53:18,248
Because he didn't
take my advice.

723
00:53:24,563 --> 00:53:26,997
Donovan.

724
00:53:27,065 --> 00:53:28,362
Didn't I warn you

725
00:53:28,434 --> 00:53:30,868
not to trust anybody,
Dr.Jones?

726
00:53:30,936 --> 00:53:32,870
I misjudged you, Walter.

727
00:53:32,938 --> 00:53:36,396
I knew you would sell your
mother for an Etruscan vase,

728
00:53:36,475 --> 00:53:38,466
but I didn't know
you would sell

729
00:53:38,544 --> 00:53:40,136
your country
and your soul

730
00:53:40,212 --> 00:53:42,146
to the slime
of humanity.

731
00:53:42,247 --> 00:53:45,808
Dr.Schneider...

732
00:53:45,884 --> 00:53:48,079
there are pages
torn out of this.

733
00:53:56,462 --> 00:53:59,431
This book contained a map,
a map with no names,

734
00:53:59,498 --> 00:54:02,023
precise directions
from the unknown city

735
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,762
to the secret Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.

736
00:54:04,837 --> 00:54:06,099
So it did.

737
00:54:06,171 --> 00:54:08,036
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

738
00:54:08,106 --> 00:54:10,040
We must have
these pages back.

739
00:54:10,108 --> 00:54:11,370
You're wasting
your breath.

740
00:54:11,443 --> 00:54:12,637
He won't tell us,

741
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:15,009
and he doesn't have to.

742
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,016
It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

743
00:54:19,084 --> 00:54:21,109
He's given them
to Marcus Brody.

744
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,118
Marcus?

745
00:54:22,254 --> 00:54:24,552
You didn't drag poor
Marcus along, did you?

746
00:54:24,623 --> 00:54:26,113
He's not up
to the challenge.

747
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:28,125
He sticks out
like a sore thumb.

748
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,488
We'll find him.

749
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:30,721
The hell you will.

750
00:54:30,796 --> 00:54:32,491
He's got a two-day
head start on you,

751
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:33,861
which is more
than he needs.

752
00:54:33,932 --> 00:54:36,264
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

753
00:54:36,335 --> 00:54:37,563
from here to the Sudan.

754
00:54:37,636 --> 00:54:40,503
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

755
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:42,062
He'll blend in, disappear.

756
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,698
You'll never see him again.

757
00:54:43,775 --> 00:54:47,677
With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.

758
00:54:47,813 --> 00:54:49,838
Does anyone here
speak English?

759
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:50,904
Or even ancient Greek?

760
00:54:50,983 --> 00:54:52,416
Uh, water?
No, thank you, sir.

761
00:54:52,484 --> 00:54:53,849
No. Fish make love in it.

762
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:55,113
Goodness me.

763
00:54:55,187 --> 00:54:56,119
Thank you so much.

764
00:54:56,188 --> 00:54:57,155
No, I don't like that.

765
00:54:57,256 --> 00:54:58,314
No, I really don't want...

766
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:59,982
No, no, thank you very much.

767
00:55:00,058 --> 00:55:02,754
No, thank you, madam.
I'm a vegetarian.

768
00:55:02,828 --> 00:55:06,093
Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?

769
00:55:06,164 --> 00:55:07,324
Mr.Brody!

770
00:55:07,399 --> 00:55:08,923
Oh, Sallah.
What a relief.

771
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:11,094
Marcus Brody, sir.

772
00:55:11,236 --> 00:55:12,203
But where is Indy?

773
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:13,238
Oh, he's in Austria.

774
00:55:13,305 --> 00:55:14,272
A slight detour.

775
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:15,670
You are on your own?

776
00:55:15,741 --> 00:55:16,867
Yes, but don't panic.

777
00:55:16,942 --> 00:55:18,466
Everything's under control.

778
00:55:18,544 --> 00:55:20,637
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

779
00:55:20,712 --> 00:55:21,644
Oh, yes,
of course.

780
00:55:21,713 --> 00:55:22,839
But where
are we going?

781
00:55:22,915 --> 00:55:24,109
Oh, this map will show you.

782
00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:26,012
It was drawn by, uh...

783
00:55:26,084 --> 00:55:28,052
Mr.Brody.

784
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,111
Welcome to Iskenderun.

785
00:55:30,188 --> 00:55:32,122
The director
of the Museum of Antiquities

786
00:55:32,257 --> 00:55:33,417
has sent a car for you.

787
00:55:33,492 --> 00:55:35,756
Oh, well...
your servant, sir.

788
00:55:35,827 --> 00:55:37,124
And I am his.

789
00:55:37,229 --> 00:55:39,254
Follow me, please.

790
00:55:39,331 --> 00:55:41,322
My reputation precedes me.

791
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,129
There is no museum
in Iskenderun.

792
00:55:43,268 --> 00:55:44,735
Papers, please.

793
00:55:44,803 --> 00:55:45,770
Papers?

794
00:55:45,837 --> 00:55:46,861
Of course.

795
00:55:46,939 --> 00:55:47,997
Run.

796
00:55:48,073 --> 00:55:49,005
Yes.

797
00:55:49,074 --> 00:55:50,507
Papers. Got it here.

798
00:55:50,576 --> 00:55:52,134
Just finished
reading it myself.

799
00:55:52,277 --> 00:55:53,244
Run.

800
00:55:53,312 --> 00:55:54,244
Yes.

801
00:55:54,313 --> 00:55:55,974
"Egyptian Mail,"
morning edition.

802
00:55:56,048 --> 00:55:57,015
Run.

803
00:55:57,082 --> 00:55:58,014
Did you say, uh...

804
00:55:58,083 --> 00:55:58,708
Run!

805
00:56:14,466 --> 00:56:16,024
Okay, okay,
quick, quick, quick!

806
00:56:16,101 --> 00:56:17,932
Find the back door!
Find the back door!

807
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:34,049
Intolerable.

808
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:38,920
Dr.Schneider.
Message from Berlin.

809
00:56:38,991 --> 00:56:40,549
You must return immediately.

810
00:56:40,626 --> 00:56:42,685
A rally at the Institute
of Aryan Culture.

811
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:43,750
So?

812
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:45,091
Your presence
on the platform

813
00:56:45,163 --> 00:56:47,495
is requested
at the highest level.

814
00:56:47,566 --> 00:56:49,124
Thank you, Herr Oberst.

815
00:56:49,267 --> 00:56:50,757
I will meet you
at Iskenderun.

816
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:51,768
Take this diary

817
00:56:51,837 --> 00:56:53,031
to the Reichmuseum
in Berlin.

818
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:54,402
It will show them
our progress,

819
00:56:54,473 --> 00:56:55,405
ahead of schedule.

820
00:56:55,474 --> 00:56:56,441
Without the map,

821
00:56:56,508 --> 00:56:58,066
I'm afraid it's no
better than a souvenir.

822
00:56:58,143 --> 00:56:59,303
Let me kill them now.

823
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:00,345
No.

824
00:57:00,412 --> 00:57:02,676
If we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,

825
00:57:02,748 --> 00:57:03,942
we'll need them alive.

826
00:57:04,016 --> 00:57:06,382
Always do what
the doctor orders.

827
00:57:14,526 --> 00:57:16,050
Don't look at me like that.

828
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:18,221
We both wanted the Grail.

829
00:57:18,296 --> 00:57:21,288
I would have done
anything to get it.

830
00:57:21,366 --> 00:57:22,594
You would have
done the same.

831
00:57:22,668 --> 00:57:25,159
I'm sorry you think so.

832
00:57:35,514 --> 00:57:38,847
I can't forget
how wonderful it was.

833
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:40,384
Thank you.

834
00:57:40,452 --> 00:57:42,477
It was rather wonderful.

835
00:57:51,697 --> 00:57:53,790
Oh, Dr.Schneider.

836
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:56,857
Your car is waiting.

837
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:07,110
That's how Austrians
say good-bye.

838
00:58:13,151 --> 00:58:16,985
And this is how we say good-bye
in Germany, Dr.Jones.

839
00:58:18,523 --> 00:58:19,990
Oh!

840
00:58:25,263 --> 00:58:27,254
I liked the Austrian way
better.

841
00:58:27,332 --> 00:58:28,959
So did I.

842
00:58:29,034 --> 00:58:30,899
Let's try and get
these ropes loose.

843
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:33,494
We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do.

844
00:58:33,572 --> 00:58:35,733
You said he had
two days' start.

845
00:58:35,807 --> 00:58:37,672
That he would blend in.
Disappear.

846
00:58:37,743 --> 00:58:39,438
Are you kidding?
I made that up.

847
00:58:39,511 --> 00:58:40,443
You know Marcus.

848
00:58:40,512 --> 00:58:42,070
He got lost once
in his own museum.

849
00:58:42,147 --> 00:58:43,273
Oh...

850
00:58:43,348 --> 00:58:47,307
Can you try and reach
my left jacket pocket?

851
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,117
What am I looking for?

852
00:58:50,188 --> 00:58:51,712
My lucky charm.

853
00:58:53,258 --> 00:58:54,850
Feels like
a cigarette lighter.

854
00:58:56,061 --> 00:58:57,722
Try and burn
through the ropes.

855
00:58:57,796 --> 00:59:00,765
Very good.

856
00:59:05,137 --> 00:59:06,195
Oh!

857
00:59:25,457 --> 00:59:26,685
I ought to tell you something.

858
00:59:26,758 --> 00:59:28,020
Don't get
sentimental now Dad.

859
00:59:28,093 --> 00:59:29,492
Save it till
we get out of here.

860
00:59:29,561 --> 00:59:31,290
The floor's on fire.

861
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:33,024
- See?
- What?

862
00:59:33,098 --> 00:59:34,759
And the chair.

863
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:36,198
Move! Move it out of here!

864
00:59:36,268 --> 00:59:37,292
Go!

865
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:39,269
It's scorching the table!
Fast!

866
00:59:39,337 --> 00:59:40,304
- Move!
- Okay!

867
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:56,278
Well, we have Marcus Brody,

868
00:59:56,354 --> 00:59:59,289
but more important,
we have the map.

869
01:00:03,695 --> 01:00:05,492
"By the personal command
of the Fuhrer.

870
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:07,122
"Secrecy essential to success.

871
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:09,895
Eliminate the American
conspirators."

872
01:00:09,968 --> 01:00:13,768
Germany has declared war
on the Jones boys.

873
01:00:19,444 --> 01:00:20,376
- Dad!
- What?

874
01:00:20,445 --> 01:00:21,377
Dad!

875
01:00:21,446 --> 01:00:22,378
What?

876
01:00:22,447 --> 01:00:23,379
- Dad!
- What?

877
01:00:23,448 --> 01:00:24,642
Head for the fireplace!

878
01:00:24,716 --> 01:00:25,705
Oh.

879
01:00:37,729 --> 01:00:39,788
I think I can get
these ropes off.

880
01:00:40,999 --> 01:00:41,988
Whoops.

881
01:00:52,711 --> 01:00:55,839
Our situation has not improved.

882
01:00:55,914 --> 01:00:57,814
Listen, Dad, I'm almost free.

883
01:01:12,964 --> 01:01:14,295
Alarm!

884
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:25,002
This is intolerable.

885
01:01:26,244 --> 01:01:27,541
I'm out, Dad.

886
01:01:27,612 --> 01:01:29,637
Well done, boy.

887
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,649
Come on, Dad.

888
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,618
Dead end.

889
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:16,251
There's got to be a...

890
01:02:16,328 --> 01:02:18,125
a secret door or a...

891
01:02:18,263 --> 01:02:20,697
passageway
or something.

892
01:02:20,765 --> 01:02:24,030
I find that if I just
sit down and think...

893
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:28,263
Dad!

894
01:02:32,177 --> 01:02:34,475
...the solution presents itself.

895
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:44,651
Great. More boats.

896
01:02:47,692 --> 01:02:48,954
You say this has been

897
01:02:49,027 --> 01:02:51,427
just another typical
day for you, huh?

898
01:02:53,164 --> 01:02:56,292
No! But better than most.

899
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:00,604
Come on, Dad. Come on.

900
01:03:00,672 --> 01:03:02,003
What about the boat?

901
01:03:02,073 --> 01:03:04,098
We're not going on the boat?

902
01:03:19,257 --> 01:03:20,246
Jones!

903
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:34,061
Halt! Halt!

904
01:05:36,895 --> 01:05:38,226
- Stop!
- What?

905
01:05:38,296 --> 01:05:40,025
Stop! Stop!

906
01:05:40,098 --> 01:05:41,895
You're going the wrong way.

907
01:05:41,966 --> 01:05:43,661
We have to get to Berlin.

908
01:05:43,735 --> 01:05:45,760
Brody's this way.

909
01:05:45,837 --> 01:05:47,634
My diary's in Berlin.

910
01:05:47,705 --> 01:05:49,969
We don't
need the diary, Dad.

911
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:51,599
Marcus has the map.

912
01:05:51,676 --> 01:05:54,839
There is more in the diary
than just the map.

913
01:05:56,014 --> 01:05:58,342
All right, Dad. Tell me.

914
01:05:58,342 --> 01:06:04,076
Well, he who finds the Grail
must face the final challenge.

915
01:06:04,148 --> 01:06:05,581
What final challenge?

916
01:06:05,649 --> 01:06:08,812
Three devices
of such lethal cunning.

917
01:06:08,886 --> 01:06:10,046
Booby traps?

918
01:06:10,121 --> 01:06:11,418
Oh, yes.

919
01:06:11,489 --> 01:06:14,890
But I found the clues that
will safely take us through,

920
01:06:14,959 --> 01:06:17,189
in the Chronicles
of St. Anselm.

921
01:06:17,261 --> 01:06:19,661
Well, what are they?

922
01:06:23,234 --> 01:06:24,599
Can't you remember?

923
01:06:26,303 --> 01:06:27,827
I wrote them down in my diary

924
01:06:27,905 --> 01:06:30,430
so that I wouldn't have
to remember.

925
01:06:30,508 --> 01:06:32,237
Half the German army's
on our tail,

926
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:34,004
and you want me to go
to Berlin?

927
01:06:34,078 --> 01:06:35,102
Into the lion's den?

928
01:06:35,179 --> 01:06:36,168
Yes.

929
01:06:36,247 --> 01:06:38,147
The only thing that matters
is the Grail.

930
01:06:38,215 --> 01:06:39,580
What about Marcus?

931
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:41,641
Marcus would agree with me.

932
01:06:41,719 --> 01:06:44,187
Two selfless martyrs.

933
01:06:44,255 --> 01:06:46,155
Jesus Christ.

934
01:06:49,326 --> 01:06:50,884
That's for blasphemy.

935
01:06:54,064 --> 01:06:59,559
The quest for the Grail
is not archaeology.

936
01:06:59,637 --> 01:07:02,197
It's a race against evil.

937
01:07:02,273 --> 01:07:06,004
If it is captured by the Nazis,
the armies of darkness

938
01:07:06,076 --> 01:07:08,544
will march all over
the face of the Earth.

939
01:07:08,612 --> 01:07:10,011
Do you understand me?

940
01:07:11,982 --> 01:07:13,847
This is an obsession, Dad.

941
01:07:13,918 --> 01:07:15,977
I never understood it.

942
01:07:16,053 --> 01:07:17,452
Never.

943
01:07:19,256 --> 01:07:20,848
Neither did Mom.

944
01:07:20,925 --> 01:07:22,916
Oh, yes, she did.

945
01:07:22,993 --> 01:07:24,961
Only too well.

946
01:07:25,029 --> 01:07:30,433
Unfortunately, she kept
her illness from me

947
01:07:30,501 --> 01:07:33,129
until all I could do
was mourn her.

948
01:08:35,766 --> 01:08:39,361
My boy, we are pilgrims
in an unholy land.

949
01:09:08,832 --> 01:09:10,823
Fraulein Doctor.

950
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:12,027
Where is it?

951
01:09:12,102 --> 01:09:13,194
How did you get here?

952
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:14,430
Where is it?

953
01:09:14,505 --> 01:09:16,871
I want it.

954
01:09:18,275 --> 01:09:21,210
You came back for the book? Why?

955
01:09:21,345 --> 01:09:23,210
My father didn't want
it incinerated.

956
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,805
Is that
what you think of me?

957
01:09:25,883 --> 01:09:27,680
I believe in the Grail,
not the swastika.

958
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:29,082
But you stood up to be counted

959
01:09:29,153 --> 01:09:31,644
with the enemy of everything
that the Grail stands for.

960
01:09:31,722 --> 01:09:33,656
Who gives a damn what you think?

961
01:09:33,724 --> 01:09:35,214
You do.

962
01:09:35,292 --> 01:09:39,023
All I have to
do is squeeze.

963
01:09:39,096 --> 01:09:41,360
All I have to do is scream.

964
01:09:50,574 --> 01:09:51,666
I've got it.

965
01:09:51,742 --> 01:09:53,710
Let's get the hell out of here.

966
01:11:05,849 --> 01:11:06,941
What did you get?

967
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:08,143
I don't know.

968
01:11:08,218 --> 01:11:10,152
First available flight
out of Germany.

969
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,279
Good.

970
01:11:36,547 --> 01:11:39,812
Well, we made it.

971
01:11:39,883 --> 01:11:43,216
When we're airborne,
with Germany behind us,

972
01:11:43,287 --> 01:11:46,154
then I'll share
that sentiment.

973
01:11:46,223 --> 01:11:48,316
Relax.

974
01:12:33,003 --> 01:12:35,301
Tickets, please.

975
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,511
Guten Tag...

976
01:12:48,585 --> 01:12:50,314
Herr Jones.

977
01:12:53,891 --> 01:12:55,153
Tickets, please.

978
01:13:07,738 --> 01:13:09,706
Oh, we should
get out of here.

979
01:13:11,241 --> 01:13:13,004
No ticket.

980
01:13:15,712 --> 01:13:16,406
Ticket.

981
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,879
- Ticket!
- Ticket!

982
01:13:17,948 --> 01:13:19,347
- Ticket!
- Ticket!

983
01:13:36,633 --> 01:13:37,964
You know,

984
01:13:38,035 --> 01:13:42,438
sharing your adventures is
an interesting experience.

985
01:13:42,506 --> 01:13:44,770
That's not all we shared.

986
01:13:44,842 --> 01:13:46,275
It's disgraceful.

987
01:13:46,343 --> 01:13:48,038
You're old enough
to be her fa...

988
01:13:48,111 --> 01:13:49,373
her-her grandfather.

989
01:13:49,446 --> 01:13:51,414
Well, I'm as human
as the next man.

990
01:13:51,481 --> 01:13:53,449
I was the next man.

991
01:13:53,517 --> 01:13:54,643
Oh.

992
01:13:55,853 --> 01:13:57,445
Of course. Well...

993
01:13:57,521 --> 01:14:00,012
Ships that pass
in the night.

994
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:03,526
Do you remember the last time
we had a quiet drink, hmm?

995
01:14:05,562 --> 01:14:06,893
I had a milkshake.

996
01:14:06,964 --> 01:14:08,898
Hmm?

997
01:14:08,966 --> 01:14:11,161
What did we
talk about?

998
01:14:11,235 --> 01:14:13,226
We didn't talk.

999
01:14:13,337 --> 01:14:15,703
We never talked.

1000
01:14:15,772 --> 01:14:20,607
Do I detect
a rebuke?

1001
01:14:20,677 --> 01:14:22,645
A regret.

1002
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:24,203
It was just the two of us, Dad.

1003
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:25,839
It was a lonely way to grow up.

1004
01:14:25,916 --> 01:14:27,042
For you, too.

1005
01:14:27,117 --> 01:14:28,880
If you'd been an ordinary,
average father,

1006
01:14:28,952 --> 01:14:31,216
like the other guys' dads,
you'd have understood that.

1007
01:14:31,288 --> 01:14:34,382
Actually, I was
a wonderful father.

1008
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:36,426
When?

1009
01:14:36,493 --> 01:14:38,358
Did I ever tell
you to eat up?

1010
01:14:38,428 --> 01:14:40,020
Go to bed?
Wash your ears?

1011
01:14:40,097 --> 01:14:41,621
Do your homework? No.

1012
01:14:41,698 --> 01:14:43,495
I respected
your privacy,

1013
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:45,831
and I taught
you self-reliance.

1014
01:14:45,903 --> 01:14:46,927
What you taught me was

1015
01:14:47,004 --> 01:14:48,471
that I was
less important to you

1016
01:14:48,538 --> 01:14:49,937
than people
who'd been dead

1017
01:14:50,007 --> 01:14:51,565
for 500 years
in another country.

1018
01:14:51,642 --> 01:14:53,405
And I learned it so well

1019
01:14:53,477 --> 01:14:56,275
that we've hardly spoken
for 20 years.

1020
01:14:56,346 --> 01:14:58,610
You left just when you
were becoming interesting.

1021
01:14:58,682 --> 01:15:00,149
Unbelievable.

1022
01:15:00,217 --> 01:15:01,275
Dad, how can you...?

1023
01:15:01,385 --> 01:15:02,409
Very well.

1024
01:15:02,486 --> 01:15:04,920
I'm here now.

1025
01:15:04,988 --> 01:15:07,013
What do you want
to talk about?

1026
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:08,216
Hmm?

1027
01:15:08,358 --> 01:15:10,758
Well, I...

1028
01:15:12,729 --> 01:15:14,424
Uh...

1029
01:15:18,201 --> 01:15:20,465
I can't think of anything.

1030
01:15:20,537 --> 01:15:22,596
Then what are
you complaining about?

1031
01:15:24,241 --> 01:15:26,209
Look, we have work to do.

1032
01:15:27,878 --> 01:15:29,812
When we get to
Alexandretta,

1033
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,178
we will face
three challenges.

1034
01:15:32,249 --> 01:15:34,183
The first,

1035
01:15:34,251 --> 01:15:35,775
"The Breath of God.

1036
01:15:35,852 --> 01:15:38,116
Only the penitent
man will pass."

1037
01:15:38,188 --> 01:15:39,450
Second,

1038
01:15:39,523 --> 01:15:40,785
"The Word of God.

1039
01:15:40,857 --> 01:15:44,418
Only in the footsteps
of God will he proceed."

1040
01:15:44,494 --> 01:15:45,586
Third,

1041
01:15:45,662 --> 01:15:47,152
"The Path of God.

1042
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:49,255
"Only in the leap
from the lion's head

1043
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:51,893
will he prove his worth."

1044
01:15:54,004 --> 01:15:56,029
What does that mean?

1045
01:15:56,106 --> 01:15:58,040
I don't know.

1046
01:15:58,108 --> 01:15:59,541
We'll find out.

1047
01:16:06,049 --> 01:16:09,075
We're turning around.

1048
01:16:09,152 --> 01:16:11,586
They're taking us back
to Germany.

1049
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:19,925
Well, I thought
it would take them a lot longer

1050
01:16:19,997 --> 01:16:21,328
to figure out
the radio was dead.

1051
01:16:21,398 --> 01:16:23,366
Come on, Dad. Move!

1052
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:29,368
Come on, Dad. Come on!

1053
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,447
I didn't know you
could fly a plane.

1054
01:16:45,522 --> 01:16:46,682
Fly, yes.

1055
01:16:48,925 --> 01:16:51,223
Land, no.

1056
01:17:14,751 --> 01:17:16,912
Dad, you're going to have
to use the machine gun.

1057
01:17:16,987 --> 01:17:19,182
Get it ready.

1058
01:17:19,256 --> 01:17:21,656
Eleven o'clock!

1059
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:23,989
Dad, eleven o'clock!

1060
01:17:25,062 --> 01:17:27,530
What happens at eleven o'clock?

1061
01:17:27,597 --> 01:17:29,565
Twelve, eleven, ten.

1062
01:17:29,633 --> 01:17:31,601
Eleven o'clock, fire!

1063
01:17:58,095 --> 01:18:00,154
Dad, are we hit?!

1064
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:02,255
More or less.

1065
01:18:02,332 --> 01:18:04,197
Son, I'm sorry.

1066
01:18:04,334 --> 01:18:06,427
They got us.

1067
01:18:08,405 --> 01:18:09,394
Hang on, Dad.

1068
01:18:09,473 --> 01:18:10,735
We're going in!

1069
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:24,546
Nice landing.

1070
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:26,646
Thanks.

1071
01:18:41,071 --> 01:18:42,561
Those people are
trying to kill us!

1072
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:43,731
I know, Dad!

1073
01:18:43,807 --> 01:18:45,172
Well.

1074
01:18:45,242 --> 01:18:47,233
It's a new
experience for me.

1075
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:49,870
It happens to me all the time.

1076
01:19:20,343 --> 01:19:22,311
This is intolerable!

1077
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,045
This could be close.

1078
01:19:33,356 --> 01:19:35,916
Faster, boy! Faster!

1079
01:19:51,575 --> 01:19:53,941
Well, they don't come
any closer than that!

1080
01:20:09,759 --> 01:20:12,592
Dad, he's coming back!

1081
01:20:59,142 --> 01:21:01,702
I suddenly
remembered my Charlemagne.

1082
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:04,679
"Let my armies be the rocks
and the trees

1083
01:21:04,748 --> 01:21:06,909
and the birds in the sky."

1084
01:21:24,434 --> 01:21:25,628
These pages are taken

1085
01:21:25,702 --> 01:21:28,193
from Professor Jones'
diary, Your Highness,

1086
01:21:28,271 --> 01:21:29,568
and they include a map

1087
01:21:29,639 --> 01:21:32,403
that pinpoints the exact
location of the Grail.

1088
01:21:32,475 --> 01:21:35,069
As you can see, the Grail
is all but in our hands.

1089
01:21:35,145 --> 01:21:36,271
However, Your Highness,

1090
01:21:36,379 --> 01:21:38,438
we would not think
of crossing your soil

1091
01:21:38,515 --> 01:21:39,777
without your permission,

1092
01:21:39,849 --> 01:21:42,079
nor of removing the
Grail from your borders

1093
01:21:42,152 --> 01:21:45,121
without suitable
compensation.

1094
01:21:47,357 --> 01:21:49,484
What have you brought?

1095
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,000
Precious valuables,
Your Highness,

1096
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:03,005
donated by some
of the finest families

1097
01:22:03,073 --> 01:22:05,132
in all of Germany.

1098
01:22:08,311 --> 01:22:09,642
Ah!

1099
01:22:09,713 --> 01:22:12,682
Rolls-Royce
Phantom Two.

1100
01:22:12,749 --> 01:22:14,239
Four-point-three liter,

1101
01:22:14,317 --> 01:22:16,842
30 horsepower,
six-cylinder engine,

1102
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,582
with Stromberg
downdraft carburetor.

1103
01:22:19,656 --> 01:22:23,183
Can go from zero to
100 kilometers an hour

1104
01:22:23,259 --> 01:22:25,591
in 12.5 seconds.

1105
01:22:25,662 --> 01:22:27,823
And I even
like the color.

1106
01:22:27,897 --> 01:22:31,298
The keys are in the ignition,
Your Highness.

1107
01:22:32,602 --> 01:22:35,093
You shall have
camels, horses,

1108
01:22:35,171 --> 01:22:37,105
an armed escort, provisions,

1109
01:22:37,173 --> 01:22:39,107
desert vehicles

1110
01:22:39,175 --> 01:22:40,369
and tanks.

1111
01:22:40,443 --> 01:22:42,411
You're welcome.

1112
01:22:57,994 --> 01:22:59,427
We have no time to lose.

1113
01:22:59,496 --> 01:23:02,124
Indiana Jones
and his father have escaped.

1114
01:23:04,868 --> 01:23:06,768
We go this way.

1115
01:23:06,836 --> 01:23:08,394
Get that camel
out of the way.

1116
01:23:10,874 --> 01:23:12,603
What happened
to Marcus, Sallah?

1117
01:23:12,675 --> 01:23:15,542
Ah, they set out across
the desert this afternoon.

1118
01:23:15,612 --> 01:23:18,445
I believe they took
Mr.Brody with them.

1119
01:23:19,883 --> 01:23:22,647
Now they have the map.

1120
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:25,347
And in this sort of race,

1121
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:28,687
there's no silver medal
for finishing second.

1122
01:23:50,513 --> 01:23:53,243
Care to wet your
whistle, Marcus?

1123
01:23:53,316 --> 01:23:55,284
I'd rather spit
in your face.

1124
01:23:55,418 --> 01:23:57,511
But as I haven't
got any spit...

1125
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:02,488
Must be within
three or four miles.

1126
01:24:02,559 --> 01:24:05,289
Otherwise we are
off the map.

1127
01:24:07,063 --> 01:24:09,793
Well, Marcus,
we are on the brink

1128
01:24:09,866 --> 01:24:11,993
of the recovery
of the greatest artifact

1129
01:24:12,068 --> 01:24:13,467
in the history
of mankind.

1130
01:24:13,536 --> 01:24:16,027
You're meddling with powers

1131
01:24:16,105 --> 01:24:18,972
you cannot
possibly comprehend.

1132
01:24:24,314 --> 01:24:26,942
Ah, I see Brody.

1133
01:24:27,016 --> 01:24:29,484
He seems okay.

1134
01:24:32,388 --> 01:24:33,980
They've got a tank.

1135
01:24:39,996 --> 01:24:41,588
Six-pound gun.

1136
01:24:41,664 --> 01:24:43,393
What do you think
you're doing there?

1137
01:24:43,466 --> 01:24:44,398
Get down!

1138
01:24:44,467 --> 01:24:47,061
Dad, we're well out of range.

1139
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:59,114
That car belonged
to my brother-in-law.

1140
01:24:59,182 --> 01:25:00,444
Come on, come on!

1141
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:02,417
I can't see anyone up there.

1142
01:25:02,485 --> 01:25:04,214
Maybe it wasn't
even Jones.

1143
01:25:04,287 --> 01:25:05,845
No, it is him,
all right.

1144
01:25:05,922 --> 01:25:07,617
He's here somewhere.

1145
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:10,420
Put Brody in the tank.

1146
01:25:18,134 --> 01:25:20,694
Well, in this sun,

1147
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:23,068
without transportation,
they're as good as dead.

1148
01:25:32,715 --> 01:25:34,376
It's Jones, all right.

1149
01:25:38,555 --> 01:25:40,045
Now, who are
all these people?

1150
01:25:40,123 --> 01:25:41,055
Who cares?

1151
01:25:41,124 --> 01:25:43,058
As long as they're
keeping Donovan busy.

1152
01:25:43,126 --> 01:25:44,923
Dad, you stay here
while Sallah and I

1153
01:25:44,994 --> 01:25:47,053
organize some transportation.

1154
01:26:11,588 --> 01:26:13,215
I'm going after those horses.

1155
01:26:13,289 --> 01:26:14,221
I'll take the camels.

1156
01:26:14,357 --> 01:26:15,324
I don't need camels.

1157
01:26:15,391 --> 01:26:16,323
But, Indy...

1158
01:26:16,392 --> 01:26:17,484
No camels.

1159
01:26:28,371 --> 01:26:29,838
Who is he?

1160
01:26:31,641 --> 01:26:34,576
A messenger from God.

1161
01:26:34,644 --> 01:26:37,010
For the unrighteous,

1162
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:41,449
the Cup of Life
holds everlasting damnation.

1163
01:26:59,869 --> 01:27:00,836
Marcus!

1164
01:27:01,871 --> 01:27:02,929
Oh.

1165
01:27:03,006 --> 01:27:06,134
"Genius of the Restoration..."

1166
01:27:06,209 --> 01:27:09,201
"Aid our own resuscitation."

1167
01:27:09,278 --> 01:27:10,540
Henry, what are you
doing here?

1168
01:27:10,613 --> 01:27:11,978
It's a rescue, old boy.
Come on.

1169
01:27:18,388 --> 01:27:19,582
Search him.

1170
01:27:19,656 --> 01:27:21,886
What is in this book?

1171
01:27:21,958 --> 01:27:25,519
That miserable
little diary of yours.

1172
01:27:25,595 --> 01:27:27,756
We have the map.
The book is useless.

1173
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:31,095
And yet you come all the way
back to Berlin to get it.

1174
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:32,225
Why?

1175
01:27:32,301 --> 01:27:35,202
What are you hiding?

1176
01:27:35,271 --> 01:27:36,932
What does the diary
tell you

1177
01:27:37,006 --> 01:27:39,736
that it doesn't
tell us?

1178
01:27:39,809 --> 01:27:43,245
It tells me that goose-stepping
morons like yourself

1179
01:27:43,379 --> 01:27:47,179
should try reading books
instead of burning them.

1180
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:48,740
Colonel!

1181
01:27:48,818 --> 01:27:50,217
Jones is getting away.

1182
01:27:50,286 --> 01:27:52,015
I think not,

1183
01:27:52,088 --> 01:27:53,385
Herr Donovan.

1184
01:27:53,456 --> 01:27:55,890
Not that Jones,
the other Jones!

1185
01:28:05,201 --> 01:28:07,863
Sallah, I said no camels!

1186
01:28:07,937 --> 01:28:09,063
That's five camels.

1187
01:28:09,138 --> 01:28:10,127
Can't you count?

1188
01:28:10,206 --> 01:28:12,436
Compensation for
my brother-in-law's car.

1189
01:28:12,508 --> 01:28:14,703
Indy, your father
and Brody...

1190
01:28:14,777 --> 01:28:16,176
Where's my father?

1191
01:28:16,245 --> 01:28:17,405
They have them.

1192
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,778
In the belly
of that steel beast.

1193
01:28:22,151 --> 01:28:23,880
Hyah!

1194
01:28:31,427 --> 01:28:32,917
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

1195
01:28:32,995 --> 01:28:34,587
Hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah!

1196
01:28:42,839 --> 01:28:43,965
Fire!

1197
01:30:44,594 --> 01:30:47,290
Dad! Dad!

1198
01:30:47,363 --> 01:30:48,227
Dad!

1199
01:30:48,297 --> 01:30:49,594
Junior?

1200
01:30:49,665 --> 01:30:51,132
Junior?!

1201
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:52,428
Junior!

1202
01:32:07,109 --> 01:32:08,599
Dad!

1203
01:32:10,413 --> 01:32:11,471
Dad!

1204
01:32:11,547 --> 01:32:13,276
Dad! Get out!

1205
01:33:33,329 --> 01:33:35,058
Henry, the pen...

1206
01:33:35,131 --> 01:33:36,758
- What?
- But don't you see?

1207
01:33:36,832 --> 01:33:40,063
The pen is mightier
than the sword.

1208
01:34:02,391 --> 01:34:03,949
Look what you did.

1209
01:34:04,026 --> 01:34:05,618
It's war.

1210
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:13,062
Didn't I tell you
it was a rescue, huh?

1211
01:35:17,399 --> 01:35:18,661
Dad!

1212
01:35:18,734 --> 01:35:20,531
Yeah?

1213
01:35:20,603 --> 01:35:22,434
You call this archaeology?

1214
01:35:22,505 --> 01:35:23,733
Get out of there, Dad.

1215
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:36,809
How does one
get off this thing?

1216
01:35:43,759 --> 01:35:44,817
Where's Marcus?

1217
01:35:48,664 --> 01:35:50,063
Dad!

1218
01:35:54,503 --> 01:35:55,663
Hang on, Dad!

1219
01:36:02,111 --> 01:36:04,602
Father of Indy,
give me your hand!

1220
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:06,443
Sallah!

1221
01:36:06,515 --> 01:36:07,880
Get Dad!

1222
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:09,850
Give me your hand!

1223
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,129
Junior!

1224
01:37:02,271 --> 01:37:03,602
Indy!

1225
01:37:12,815 --> 01:37:15,045
Oh, God.

1226
01:37:15,117 --> 01:37:17,210
I've lost him.

1227
01:37:20,256 --> 01:37:25,057
And I never told him anything.

1228
01:37:25,127 --> 01:37:29,223
I just wasn't ready, Marcus.

1229
01:37:29,365 --> 01:37:33,301
Five minutes
would have been enough.

1230
01:38:08,971 --> 01:38:11,997
I thought
I'd lost you, boy!

1231
01:38:12,074 --> 01:38:15,840
I thought
you had too, sir.

1232
01:38:15,911 --> 01:38:18,539
Mmm...

1233
01:38:28,424 --> 01:38:32,224
Well...

1234
01:38:32,361 --> 01:38:35,228
Well done. Come on.

1235
01:38:37,833 --> 01:38:40,199
Let's go, then.

1236
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:43,661
Why are you
sitting there resting

1237
01:38:43,739 --> 01:38:45,536
when we're so near the end?!

1238
01:38:45,607 --> 01:38:47,871
Come on, let's go!

1239
01:38:59,822 --> 01:39:04,054
The Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.

1240
01:41:31,173 --> 01:41:32,834
Helmut, another volunteer!

1241
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:03,995
I never expected
to see you again.

1242
01:42:04,072 --> 01:42:07,007
I'm like a bad penny;
I always turn up.

1243
01:42:07,075 --> 01:42:09,202
Step back now,
Dr.Schneider.

1244
01:42:09,278 --> 01:42:11,109
Give Dr.Jones some room.

1245
01:42:11,179 --> 01:42:14,171
He's going to recover
the Grail for us.

1246
01:42:16,218 --> 01:42:18,778
Impossible?
What do you say, Jones?

1247
01:42:18,854 --> 01:42:20,981
Ready to go down in history?

1248
01:42:21,056 --> 01:42:22,250
As what?

1249
01:42:22,324 --> 01:42:23,985
A Nazi stooge like you?

1250
01:42:24,059 --> 01:42:25,822
The Nazis?!

1251
01:42:25,894 --> 01:42:28,829
Is that the limit
of your vision?

1252
01:42:28,897 --> 01:42:30,728
The Nazis want
to write themselves

1253
01:42:30,799 --> 01:42:32,164
into the Grail legend...

1254
01:42:32,234 --> 01:42:33,861
take on the world.

1255
01:42:33,936 --> 01:42:37,235
Well, they're welcome.

1256
01:42:37,306 --> 01:42:39,831
But I want
the Grail itself.

1257
01:42:39,908 --> 01:42:43,605
The cup that gives
everlasting life.

1258
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:45,010
Hitler can have
the world,

1259
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:46,638
but he can't
take it with him.

1260
01:42:46,715 --> 01:42:49,377
I'm going to be
drinking my own health

1261
01:42:49,451 --> 01:42:51,976
when he's gone the way
of the dodo.

1262
01:42:55,457 --> 01:42:56,890
The Grail is mine...

1263
01:42:56,959 --> 01:42:59,393
and you're going
to get it for me.

1264
01:42:59,461 --> 01:43:01,952
Shooting me
won't get you anywhere.

1265
01:43:02,030 --> 01:43:04,123
You know something,
Dr.Jones?

1266
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:05,996
You're absolutely right.

1267
01:43:08,971 --> 01:43:10,939
Dad?

1268
01:43:11,006 --> 01:43:12,234
Dad?!

1269
01:43:12,374 --> 01:43:14,103
Junior...

1270
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:15,973
- No!
- Get back!

1271
01:43:33,895 --> 01:43:35,988
You can't save him
when you're dead!

1272
01:43:36,064 --> 01:43:37,429
The healing power
of the Grail

1273
01:43:37,499 --> 01:43:39,763
is the only thing
that can save your father now.

1274
01:43:39,835 --> 01:43:43,293
It's time to ask yourself
what you believe.

1275
01:44:17,339 --> 01:44:21,833
"The Breath of God...

1276
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:25,539
...only the penitent man
will pass."

1277
01:44:25,614 --> 01:44:28,549
"The penitent man will pass.

1278
01:44:46,501 --> 01:44:49,265
The penitent man will pass.

1279
01:44:49,371 --> 01:44:52,033
The penitent man...

1280
01:44:54,476 --> 01:44:57,001
"Only the penitent man
will pass."

1281
01:44:57,079 --> 01:44:59,639
"Only the penitent
man will pass."

1282
01:44:59,715 --> 01:45:01,649
The penitent man will pass.

1283
01:45:01,717 --> 01:45:03,582
The penitent, penitent...

1284
01:45:03,652 --> 01:45:05,210
The penitent man...

1285
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:06,753
The penitent man...

1286
01:45:06,822 --> 01:45:07,880
The penitent...

1287
01:45:07,956 --> 01:45:10,982
The penitent man
is humble before God.

1288
01:45:11,059 --> 01:45:12,822
Penitent. Penitent...

1289
01:45:12,894 --> 01:45:14,725
The penitent man...

1290
01:45:14,796 --> 01:45:17,959
Penitent man
is humble...

1291
01:45:18,033 --> 01:45:19,557
...kneels before God.

1292
01:45:19,634 --> 01:45:20,601
Kneel!

1293
01:45:29,478 --> 01:45:30,843
I'm through!

1294
01:45:30,912 --> 01:45:34,473
We're through.

1295
01:45:36,451 --> 01:45:38,112
He's all right.

1296
01:45:38,186 --> 01:45:39,744
No.

1297
01:45:39,821 --> 01:45:42,813
The second challenge:
"The Word of God."

1298
01:45:42,891 --> 01:45:46,418
"Only in the footsteps
of God will he proceed."

1299
01:45:50,265 --> 01:45:52,859
The Word of God...

1300
01:45:52,934 --> 01:45:54,299
The Word of...

1301
01:45:57,506 --> 01:46:00,964
Proceed in the footsteps
of the Word.

1302
01:46:01,042 --> 01:46:02,304
"The Word of God..."

1303
01:46:02,377 --> 01:46:04,242
No, Henry.
Try not to talk.

1304
01:46:10,852 --> 01:46:13,821
The name of God...

1305
01:46:13,889 --> 01:46:18,883
The name of God...

1306
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,724
Jehovah.

1307
01:46:21,797 --> 01:46:27,360
But in the Latin alphabet,
Jehovah begins with an "I."

1308
01:46:27,435 --> 01:46:29,460
J...

1309
01:46:35,277 --> 01:46:36,403
Oh, dear.

1310
01:46:40,949 --> 01:46:42,211
Idiot!

1311
01:46:42,284 --> 01:46:45,913
In Latin, Jehovah
starts with an "I."

1312
01:46:47,522 --> 01:46:49,717
"I"...

1313
01:46:49,791 --> 01:46:52,157
"E"...

1314
01:46:52,227 --> 01:46:53,751
"H"...

1315
01:46:53,829 --> 01:46:55,023
"O"...

1316
01:46:55,096 --> 01:46:56,028
Oh!

1317
01:46:56,097 --> 01:46:58,497
"V"...

1318
01:46:58,567 --> 01:47:00,091
"A"...

1319
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:24,358
"The Path of God."

1320
01:47:26,995 --> 01:47:30,021
"Only in the leap
from the lion's head

1321
01:47:30,098 --> 01:47:34,034
will he prove his worth."

1322
01:47:36,271 --> 01:47:41,072
Impossible...
nobody can jump this.

1323
01:47:42,010 --> 01:47:43,944
Indy!

1324
01:47:44,012 --> 01:47:46,037
Indy, you must hurry!

1325
01:47:46,114 --> 01:47:47,604
Come quickly!

1326
01:47:53,855 --> 01:47:56,255
It's a leap of faith.

1327
01:47:56,324 --> 01:47:57,814
Oh, geez...

1328
01:47:57,893 --> 01:48:00,453
You must believe, boy.

1329
01:48:00,528 --> 01:48:02,826
You must... believe.

1330
01:49:40,795 --> 01:49:42,922
Oh.

1331
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:51,534
I knew you'd come,

1332
01:49:51,606 --> 01:49:54,200
but my strength has left me.

1333
01:49:54,275 --> 01:49:56,300
Who are you?

1334
01:49:56,378 --> 01:49:58,778
The last of three brothers

1335
01:49:58,847 --> 01:50:01,611
who swore an oath
to find the Grail

1336
01:50:01,683 --> 01:50:03,844
and to guard it.

1337
01:50:03,918 --> 01:50:06,648
That was 700 years ago.

1338
01:50:06,721 --> 01:50:09,588
A long time to wait.

1339
01:50:10,658 --> 01:50:12,853
You're strangely dressed...

1340
01:50:12,927 --> 01:50:14,918
for a knight.

1341
01:50:14,996 --> 01:50:17,590
I'm not exactly...

1342
01:50:17,665 --> 01:50:18,757
a knight.

1343
01:50:18,833 --> 01:50:20,130
What do you mean?

1344
01:50:20,201 --> 01:50:22,396
I was chosen

1345
01:50:22,470 --> 01:50:25,564
because I was the bravest,
the most worthy.

1346
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:27,574
The honor was mine

1347
01:50:27,642 --> 01:50:30,202
until another came
to challenge me

1348
01:50:30,278 --> 01:50:33,441
to single combat.

1349
01:50:33,515 --> 01:50:35,483
I pass it...

1350
01:50:35,550 --> 01:50:40,647
to you who vanquished me.

1351
01:50:42,424 --> 01:50:44,483
Listen, I don't have
time to explain, but...

1352
01:51:01,943 --> 01:51:04,138
Which one is it?

1353
01:51:04,212 --> 01:51:06,203
You must choose,

1354
01:51:06,281 --> 01:51:08,681
but choose wisely.

1355
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:11,548
For as the true Grail
will bring you life,

1356
01:51:11,619 --> 01:51:13,610
the false Grail

1357
01:51:13,688 --> 01:51:15,656
will take it from you.

1358
01:51:20,128 --> 01:51:23,029
I'm not a historian.

1359
01:51:23,098 --> 01:51:24,531
I have no idea

1360
01:51:24,599 --> 01:51:26,362
what it looks like.

1361
01:51:26,434 --> 01:51:27,924
Which one is it?

1362
01:51:28,002 --> 01:51:29,993
Let me choose.

1363
01:51:30,071 --> 01:51:32,505
Thank you, Doctor.

1364
01:51:45,553 --> 01:51:47,714
Oh, yes.

1365
01:51:52,327 --> 01:51:56,821
It's more beautiful
than I'd ever imagined.

1366
01:52:07,275 --> 01:52:11,109
This certainly is the cup
of the King of Kings.

1367
01:52:17,485 --> 01:52:19,715
Eternal life.

1368
01:52:54,022 --> 01:52:56,786
What is happening to me?

1369
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:00,191
Oh!

1370
01:53:01,429 --> 01:53:03,795
Tell me, what is happening?

1371
01:53:26,888 --> 01:53:28,822
He chose...

1372
01:53:28,890 --> 01:53:31,222
poorly.

1373
01:53:40,668 --> 01:53:43,330
It would not be made
out of gold.

1374
01:53:43,404 --> 01:53:45,565
That's the cup
of a carpenter.

1375
01:53:55,416 --> 01:53:57,577
There's only one way
to find out.

1376
01:54:11,899 --> 01:54:16,563
You have chosen wisely.

1377
01:54:16,638 --> 01:54:21,507
But the Grail cannot pass
beyond the Great Seal.

1378
01:54:21,576 --> 01:54:26,411
That is the boundary
and the price of immortality.

1379
01:55:53,134 --> 01:55:56,001
Drop your guns. Please.

1380
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:01,003
Dad, come on,
get to your feet.

1381
01:56:14,922 --> 01:56:17,516
We have got it. Come on!

1382
01:56:19,026 --> 01:56:21,494
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

1383
01:56:21,562 --> 01:56:23,587
It's ours, Indy--
yours and mine.

1384
01:56:23,664 --> 01:56:25,723
Elsa, don't cross the Seal.

1385
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:26,994
The knight warned us

1386
01:56:27,068 --> 01:56:29,298
not to take
the Grail from here.

1387
01:56:55,863 --> 01:56:56,887
Junior!

1388
01:56:56,964 --> 01:56:58,363
Junior!

1389
01:57:01,202 --> 01:57:01,861
Elsa...

1390
01:57:03,571 --> 01:57:05,562
Elsa, don't. Elsa...

1391
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:07,073
Elsa...

1392
01:57:07,141 --> 01:57:08,608
Give me your other hand, honey.

1393
01:57:08,676 --> 01:57:09,700
I can't hold you!

1394
01:57:09,777 --> 01:57:11,142
I can reach it.

1395
01:57:11,212 --> 01:57:12,907
I can reach it.

1396
01:57:12,980 --> 01:57:14,709
Elsa, give me your hand.
Give me your other hand!

1397
01:57:17,251 --> 01:57:18,240
Elsa!

1398
01:57:28,329 --> 01:57:30,661
Junior, give me
your other hand!

1399
01:57:30,731 --> 01:57:32,596
I can't hold on.

1400
01:57:32,667 --> 01:57:33,929
I can get it.

1401
01:57:34,001 --> 01:57:36,196
I can almost reach it, Dad.

1402
01:57:36,337 --> 01:57:37,929
Indiana...

1403
01:57:39,707 --> 01:57:40,935
Indiana...

1404
01:57:44,312 --> 01:57:46,542
Let it go.

1405
01:58:05,266 --> 01:58:07,700
Dad...

1406
01:58:14,208 --> 01:58:15,800
Please, Dad.

1407
01:58:46,941 --> 01:58:49,808
Elsa never really
believed in the Grail.

1408
01:58:49,877 --> 01:58:52,573
She thought she'd
found a prize.

1409
01:58:59,053 --> 01:59:01,453
What did you find, Dad?

1410
01:59:01,522 --> 01:59:03,012
Me?

1411
01:59:05,726 --> 01:59:07,250
Illumination.

1412
01:59:16,771 --> 01:59:18,295
And what did you find, Junior?

1413
01:59:18,372 --> 01:59:21,307
"Junior"? Dad...

1414
01:59:21,375 --> 01:59:23,172
Please, what does
it always mean,

1415
01:59:23,311 --> 01:59:24,573
this... this "Junior"?

1416
01:59:24,645 --> 01:59:26,772
That's his name:
Henry Jones, Junior.

1417
01:59:26,847 --> 01:59:28,508
I like Indiana.

1418
01:59:28,583 --> 01:59:29,948
We named the dog Indiana.

1419
01:59:30,017 --> 01:59:31,416
May we go home now,

1420
01:59:31,485 --> 01:59:32,747
please?

1421
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:33,980
The dog?

1422
01:59:35,823 --> 01:59:37,882
You are named after the dog?

1423
01:59:39,026 --> 01:59:43,292
I've got a lot of fond memories
of that dog.

1424
01:59:43,364 --> 01:59:46,128
Ready?

1425
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:47,827
Ready.

1426
01:59:47,902 --> 01:59:49,870
Indy! Henry! Follow me.

1427
01:59:49,937 --> 01:59:51,700
I know the way! Ha!

1428
01:59:55,009 --> 01:59:58,342
Got lost
in his own museum, huh?

1429
01:59:58,412 --> 02:00:00,175
Uh-huh.

1430
02:00:00,247 --> 02:00:02,613
After you, Junior.

1431
02:00:02,683 --> 02:00:04,241
Yes, sir. Ha!
