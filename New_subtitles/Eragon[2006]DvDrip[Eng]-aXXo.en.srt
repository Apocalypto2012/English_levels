1
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,200
<i>There was a time when the fearsome,
beautiful land of Alagaësia...</i>

2
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,200
<i>...was ruled by men astride mighty dragons.</i>

3
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,200
<i>To protect and serve was their mission.</i>

4
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>And for thousands of years,
the people prospered.</i>

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,500
<i>But the riders grew arrogant...</i>

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,200
<i>...and began to fight among themselves
for power.</i>

7
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,400
<i>Sensing their weakness...</i>

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,400
<i>...a young rider named Galbatorix
betrayed them...</i>

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,100
<i>...and in a single bloody battle,
believed he had killed them all...</i>

10
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,200
<i>...riders and dragons alike.</i>

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,500
<i>Since then, our land
has been ruled by Galbatorix.</i>

12
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,000
<i>He crushed all rebellion...</i>

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,200
<i>...including the freedom fighters
known as the Varden.</i>

14
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,000
<i>Those that survived fled to the mountains.</i>

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,900
<i>There they hoped for a miracle...</i>

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,800
<i>...that might even their odds
against the king.</i>

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,600
<i>Our story begins one night...</i>

18
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,600
<i>...as Arya, an ally of the Varden,
rides for her life...</i>

19
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,200
<i>...carrying a stone
stolen from the king himself.</i>

20
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,800
I suffer without my stone.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,400
Do not prolong my suffering.

22
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,000
<i>Miles away,
a young boy ventures out hunting.</i>

23
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,200
<i>His life and Alagaësia...</i>

24
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,500
<i>...will never be the same again.</i>

25
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,100
- Give it to me...
- Durza.

26
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,900
...and I'll let you live.

27
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,000
Is there anyone
who trusts the word of a Shade?

28
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,500
Where did you send it?

29
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,800
Poor Durza.

30
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,100
How will you tell the king you failed?

31
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,700
Come with me.

32
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,400
Two more patriotic volunteers
for the king's army.

33
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,700
My sons are not fighters.
The men you take, they never return.

34
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,600
Every village must do its share.

35
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,100
Rejoice. Your sons will be heroes.

36
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,300
Expensive taste, Eragon.

37
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,500
The king's strip. The best cut there is.
The fat just melts into the meat.

38
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,700
How much?

39
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,900
How much?

40
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,900
Too much for a poor farm boy.

41
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,900
I have something. Something to trade.

42
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,900
What is this? Some kind of stone?

43
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
- I found it.
- Stole it, more likely.

44
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,900
I was hunting.

45
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,500
Hunting in the Spine.

46
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,200
Put it back. It belongs to the king.
Tell no one you have it.

47
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,900
You'll endanger the whole village.
Now get out.

48
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,800
I don't need that sort of trouble here.
Get out.

49
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,400
Look at this. A necklace.

50
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Now, where'd a fool like you
find such an appetizing string of jewels?

51
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,000
- Interesting you should ask.
- Is that right?

52
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,600
I was walking up the lane the other day,
admiring them sitting on a branch.

53
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,700
Clap of thunder,
they fell dead at me feet.

54
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,400
So I thought,
"Well, I can't leave them there.

55
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,000
Someone might trip."

56
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,400
- So I hung them up there, out of the way.
- Do you know what I think?

57
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,600
- What's that?
- I think you're a thief.

58
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,800
- A poacher.
- Oh, no.

59
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,500
I confiscate them all
in the name of the king.

60
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,700
Don't try anything.

61
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,200
Well, I'll just cut them down
for you then, shall I?

62
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,600
- Grab those.
- Sorry I didn't pluck them.

63
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,200
Take care of the little bones.

64
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,900
Hate to see you choke.

65
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,400
All hail Eragon.
The mighty hunter returns.

66
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,600
Yeah. With his invisible catch.

67
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,500
What happened, did you get scared
when the deer growled?

68
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,400
No respect for the hunter?

69
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,500
Don't you ever learn?

70
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,600
Shall we have another lesson today?

71
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,300
You fight like an old goat, Roran.

72
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,800
Mind my breakfast.

73
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,300
- You're too slow, Roran.
- Wake up, dreamer.

74
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,300
That sounded like your head.

75
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Hey. Come on, boys. That's enough.
Come on, Roran.

76
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,100
Eragon?

77
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,100
I'm leaving.

78
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,800
I'm old enough to be recruited now.

79
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,700
Before the soldiers come looking for me.

80
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,200
I won't serve in the army.

81
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll send word when I've settled.

82
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,100
- But what--?
- He knows.

83
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,200
I already told him.

84
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,800
Where will you go?

85
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,900
I don't know yet.

86
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,700
All I know is I'm going.

87
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Roran? Eragon?

88
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,500
Come on.

89
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,700
Roran told you then?

90
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,200
Your day will come too, Eragon.

91
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,700
And you will decide for yourself
the kind of life you wish to lead.

92
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,900
Uncle, I like my life right here.

93
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,400
What many men seek
is often right under their nose.

94
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,400
But for some,
the unknown is too hard to resist.

95
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,600
Is that why my mother left?

96
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,100
My sister was in a great hurry
when she left you here.

97
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,000
Whatever her reasons, we can only trust
they were for your own good.

98
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,300
Besides, had she not,
I wouldn't have gained another son.

99
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Take these.

100
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,400
I've been saving them for you.

101
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,400
Your blessing is all I need.

102
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,300
Take care of yourself, Roran.

103
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,100
Goodbye, Father.

104
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,100
Be strong, brother.

105
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,900
And work on that aim.

106
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,800
You may make a hunter yet.

107
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,500
Not a stone.

108
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,900
An egg.

109
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Well, look at you.

110
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,300
What are you?

111
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Well, you're not a bird.

112
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,100
Where is it?

113
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,400
Too late.

114
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,600
It's hatched.

115
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,900
<i>It's hatched.</i>

116
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,700
Look at what you did.

117
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,500
Eragon, wake up.
Get on with your chores.

118
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,400
Hungry?

119
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,800
Go on.

120
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,400
Drink while it's still warm.

121
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,500
I'm sorry. That's all there is.

122
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,500
So much for our rat problem.

123
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,900
My king, Galbatorix.

124
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,400
As you feared, the dragon has hatched.

125
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,300
But to a mere farm boy.

126
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,800
To whom is not the issue.

127
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,300
When the Varden learn
that the legend is real...

128
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,200
...they will be encouraged
to challenge me.

129
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,100
And I am not interested
in being challenged.

130
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,700
There is no one left for you to fear,
my king.

131
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,900
Beyond these borders
are remnants of the resistance.

132
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,900
Dwarves. Elves. The Varden.

133
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,900
I can't let them have hope.

134
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,100
Do not let them reach the Varden.

135
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,400
I will find the boy...

136
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,500
...and kill him before he becomes a man.

137
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,500
Where's your mother?

138
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,400
Did she abandon you too?

139
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,600
Did she leave in a great hurry?

140
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,800
<i>Ra'zac.</i>

141
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,700
<i>Ra'zac.</i>

142
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,100
<i>Ra'zac.</i>

143
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,600
Kill the rider.

144
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,600
Nothing from my boys.

145
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,100
Not a word.

146
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,900
Their mother's heart is broken.

147
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,500
And for what?

148
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,000
More death? More suffering?

149
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,500
Easy, Horst. The soldiers will hear you.

150
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,900
What's that matter?

151
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,500
Speak or not speak.
It makes no difference.

152
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,200
Quiet, Brom.
A fool like you has nothing to lose.

153
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,600
No argument there.

154
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,700
Don't mind me.

155
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,400
But it wasn't always like this, was it?

156
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:19,400
There was a time when our land flourished
without cruelty and fear.

157
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,000
A time of dragons and Dragon Riders.

158
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,500
Those days are long gone.
Old Brom is going on with his stories.

159
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,900
Don't pretend you've forgotten.
Men astride magnificent beasts.

160
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,500
No one could defeat them.

161
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,100
Until, that is, one of their own...

162
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,200
...a rider named Galbatorix...

163
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,600
...decided to take all the power for himself
and cut down any rider who opposed him.

164
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,300
Enough, before you hang by a tree.

165
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,100
No!

166
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,200
Let him finish.

167
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,200
- And one day, he will pay for his crime.
- Are you deaf? Be on your way!

168
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,400
The time of Dragon Riders...

169
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,400
...will come again.

170
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,700
<i>And then Brom said:</i>

171
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,900
<i>"The time of the Dragon Riders
will come again."</i>

172
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,400
Well, first, I think you need to fly.

173
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,300
Yes, you did it!

174
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,100
She's gone.

175
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,300
<i>- What's happening?
- Brom was right, Eragon.</i>

176
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,500
<i>The time of the Dragon Riders
has come again.</i>

177
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,700
You can hear my thoughts?

178
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,000
<i>I have waited 1000 years
to hear your thoughts.</i>

179
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,500
<i>And now you can hear mine.</i>

180
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,200
<i>I am Saphira. And you are my rider.</i>

181
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,300
Rider?

182
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,600
Get out.

183
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,700
Is it true?

184
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,100
What you spoke of?

185
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,400
Didn't you hear me? Get out.

186
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,400
I want to know more.

187
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
Please?

188
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,600
Tell me about the dragons.

189
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,200
Did anybody follow you here?

190
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,800
How big will they grow?
When do they breathe fire?

191
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,900
Keep your voice down.

192
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,900
You mocked the king
in front of his soldiers.

193
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:12,500
I always say,
"Better ask forgiveness than permission."

194
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,300
Then tell me.

195
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,600
- Tell me about the dragons.
- Go home.

196
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Mind your corn. Till your fields. All right?

197
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,800
You'll just get yourself into trouble.

198
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,800
What does it make you, then?

199
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,700
A liar or a coward?

200
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,000
I know.

201
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
I know your story is true.

202
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,300
I told you.

203
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
His name is Eragon.

204
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
The boy. The boy took it with him.

205
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,800
He lives on a farm,
the furthest one in the valley.

206
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,500
Please, don't kill me.

207
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
<i>Eragon. It's you they want.</i>

208
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,600
<i>- Take me down.
- You're in danger.</i>

209
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,400
What are you doing?
I have to warn my uncle.

210
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,200
<i>It's too late. There's nothing you can do.</i>

211
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
<i>Hold on.</i>

212
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,100
<i>You're ridiculous. Hold on.</i>

213
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,300
<i>- I'm begging. Please put me down now.
- I can't. They'll kill you.</i>

214
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,000
<i>- Take me down now.
- You stupid boy.</i>

215
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,900
I'm slipping.

216
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,000
Take me down now.

217
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,200
<i>You're giving me no choice.</i>

218
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,800
Uncle? Uncle.

219
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,800
<i>Eragon?</i>

220
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
I should have been here.

221
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,100
To warn him.

222
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,900
<i>- This is your fault.
- You would have met the same fate.</i>

223
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,000
No. I could have saved him.

224
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,700
Go away.

225
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,600
And stay away.

226
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Uncle, I'm sorry.

227
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,100
- You?
- Let go of me.

228
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,100
- Where's your dragon?
- Gone.

229
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,600
- What do you mean, "gone"?
- I sent her away.

230
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,400
You can't stay here and mourn him--

231
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm not going anywhere.
Not until I bury him.

232
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,700
- There.
- What are you doing?

233
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,400
A funeral fit for a king. Come.

234
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,200
- Let go.
- Listen...

235
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,000
...they killed him, but they were after you.
If we stay here, we're both dead.

236
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,500
Now get on that horse. Go on.

237
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Get up there.

238
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,400
- Who are you?
- Ride. Now. Go on.

239
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,400
Come on, boy. Ride.

240
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,000
- Why here?
- Because I said here.

241
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,800
- Call your dragon.
- My uncle was killed because of her.

242
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,100
She was protecting you
against the Ra'zac.

243
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,100
- I could have killed them.
- That's the spirit.

244
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,500
One part brave, three parts fool.

245
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,700
What, you don't think I could do it?

246
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,700
The Ra'zac kill mercilessly.
That's what they do.

247
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,300
- But a boy of 15, 16--
- Seventeen.

248
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,200
Seventeen. Forgive me.

249
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,500
Well, I think even a 17-year-old boy...

250
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,800
...might probably last a minute
against Durza's assassins.

251
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,200
Then I'll find Durza and kill him.

252
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,300
Durza's a Shade.

253
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,800
A sorcerer possessed with demonic spirits.

254
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,600
Find Durza,
you'll be no better off than your uncle.

255
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,900
You just pray to heaven he doesn't find you
because the king won't rest until he does.

256
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,700
You are the Varden's only hope.

257
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,700
- Who are the Varden?
- Rebels. Outcasts.

258
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,800
Men who are brave or mad enough
to oppose Galbatorix.

259
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,800
They built a stronghold
in the Beor Mountains.

260
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,400
How do you know all this?

261
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,600
Because I've been about a bit.

262
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,500
I've seen things...

263
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,000
...you could never imagine.

264
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,700
Now call your dragon.

265
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,500
She's far away by now. She can't hear me.

266
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,500
Shall we have an agreement
not to lie to each other?

267
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,100
I know she hears your thoughts.
Now call your dragon.

268
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,700
<i>Saphira? Can you find us?</i>

269
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,000
<i>I never left you.</i>

270
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,100
<i>- I'm sorry for what I said.
- I understand.</i>

271
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,200
<i>You loved him very much.</i>

272
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,600
<i>- And who might this be?
- This is Brom.</i>

273
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,800
<i>He knows about dragons.</i>

274
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,500
<i>He knows about dragons?
I'll be the judge of that.</i>

275
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,500
<i>Easy. I think he's a friend.</i>

276
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,700
Muscular.

277
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,100
Graceful proportions.

278
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Talons...

279
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,300
...nicely curved.

280
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,400
Legs a bit thin.

281
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,100
<i>Only my voice is gentle, old man.</i>

282
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,000
Spikes sharp.

283
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
All in all...

284
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,400
...a fine young dragon.

285
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,400
<i>Well, he does know a bit about dragons.</i>

286
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,400
And soon, strong enough to ride.

287
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,100
Not me. I won't do it again.

288
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,000
My story was about you, Eragon.

289
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,300
It is your fate to be a Dragon Rider.

290
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,600
The Varden need a rider
if they are to defeat Durza and the king.

291
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,200
- I didn't ask for any of this.
- But you were chosen nevertheless.

292
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,500
A dragon will only hatch
if it feels the presence of its rider.

293
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,600
It'll wait forever, if it has to.

294
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
<i>What he says is true.</i>

295
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,600
But now it's found you.

296
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,900
It will serve you and only you,
and that's put your life in danger.

297
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,800
- Because it chose me?
- No.

298
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Because the easiest way for the king
to destroy your dragon is to kill you.

299
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,600
A rider will live on if his dragon is killed.

300
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
But if a rider dies...

301
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,700
<i>So does his dragon.</i>

302
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,100
Handsome blade.

303
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,100
Simple...

304
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,300
...and to the point.

305
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,200
The farm boy evaded the Ra'zac.

306
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,000
Bring me his head.

307
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,100
Durza will send his Urgals after us.

308
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,900
Ahead, five hard days ride,
is the river town of Daret...

309
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,100
...the last outpost before the foothills.

310
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,300
Now, if we can get there without
being discovered, we have a chance.

311
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,600
Tell Saphira to fly above us
and scout the countryside for Urgals...

312
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,000
...or worse, Ra'zacs.
If they find us, we'll have no chance.

313
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,800
And tell her only to come to us at night.

314
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Do as he says.

315
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,900
<i>But be careful.</i>

316
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,300
<i>You be careful.</i>

317
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,900
This way.

318
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,000
Urgals. They used to be the king's enemies.
Now they're his guard.

319
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,800
Oh, they're closer to us than I thought.
We better stay off the roads.

320
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,300
- Why can't we take them?
- Quiet.

321
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,800
You're not ready to take anything yet.

322
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,700
I have skills. I can fight.

323
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,200
My cousin, Roran and I.

324
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,300
We've trained.

325
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,700
- With swords.
- Well, then...

326
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,100
...perhaps I've underestimated you.

327
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,500
Right, then.
Let's see these skills of yours.

328
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,200
You know, this won't be fair to you,
old man.

329
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,800
Humor me.

330
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,100
Oh, dear.
Well, I see the effect of your training.

331
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,300
Good. Good.

332
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,500
Don't get overconfident.

333
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,600
It won't be your cousin Roran
you're fighting.

334
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,100
And it won't be wooden staves, either.

335
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,700
<i>I could've beaten him.
I just didn't want to hurt the old man.</i>

336
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
<i>Of course you could have.</i>

337
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,800
Don't dragons breathe fire?

338
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,700
She's not old enough to sustain a flame.

339
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,200
<i>Lucky for you.</i>

340
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,700
How did you do that?

341
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,200
What did you just do?

342
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,600
I started a fire.

343
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,400
<i>He doesn't trust me.</i>

344
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,600
<i>Maybe we need to trust him first.</i>

345
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,800
Now get to sleep. With any luck,
tomorrow, by the end of the day...

346
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
...we will have
slipped through Daret unseen.

347
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:31,800
Then it's the foothills of the Beor Mountains
and a straight shot to the Varden.

348
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,400
Eragon, wake up. Come on, wake up.

349
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,000
We're at the village of Daret.

350
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,200
We'll leave the horses here.
Keep Saphira close.

351
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,200
Buy us some bread down there.

352
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,200
Come back, meet me here.
I won't be long.

353
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,100
Don't talk to anybody.

354
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,900
Do you wish Angela to read your fortune?

355
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,100
- But I have no money.
- Did Angela ask for money?

356
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,700
Knucklebones of a dragon.

357
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,300
They will tell me everything about you.

358
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,600
This is difficult.

359
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
A young life so tangled.

360
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,900
But you have been long awaited
by many races.

361
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,100
Great battles rage around you.

362
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,000
It can't be. I don't understand.

363
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:51,300
You have powers you do not acknowledge,
but there is a doom upon you.

364
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,500
Part of it lies in a death
that rapidly approaches.

365
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,700
No. It's already happened.

366
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,300
And a girl.
She calls to you in your dreams.

367
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,700
She's part of your past...

368
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,100
...and your future.

369
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,200
Who is she? Tell me her name.

370
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,900
Do I have to do everything myself?

371
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,800
- The fortuneteller--
- Did she tell you about him, huh?

372
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,400
Come on.

373
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,000
Where's everybody gone?

374
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,200
- She told me my future.
- The future is for the living, Eragon.

375
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,300
Come on!

376
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,500
<i>Saphira!</i>

377
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,400
<i>Eragon.</i>

378
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,000
<i>Eragon.</i>

379
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,100
My hand. It burns.

380
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,800
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

381
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,900
My head.

382
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,100
Feels like I've been kicked by a horse.

383
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,800
What happened?

384
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,100
Most new Dragon Riders take years to learn
what you discovered by instinct.

385
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,600
- What was that?
- Magic.

386
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,100
I was only reacting.

387
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,600
Magic comes from dragons.

388
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,300
It flows through the riders
who command them.

389
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,100
- Saphira.
- She's fine.

390
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,100
But she felt your fear as her own.

391
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,700
Your bond with her is strong.

392
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,200
- Those were Urgals, weren't they?
- Yes.

393
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,200
- Did I kill them?
- Yes.

394
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,100
But death is nothing to celebrate.

395
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,300
Magic must be your last resort.

396
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,600
It has rules. It has limitations.

397
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,400
Before you cast a spell, you must learn
the ancient language of the elves.

398
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,700
<i>Brisingr means "fire." Is fire.</i>

399
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,300
The thing is the word.
Know the word and you control the thing.

400
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,900
Before you can cast a spell...

401
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,300
...you must have the physical strength
to withstand its effect.

402
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,000
Some spells may leave you weakened.

403
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,200
Other spells,
as you found out on the bridge...

404
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,800
...can leave you unconscious.

405
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:42,200
And yet other spells,
if you use them before you're ready...

406
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,400
...will kill you.

407
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,400
I can teach you the words...

408
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,600
...but the limits of your strength
you must learn for yourself.

409
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,200
<i>- What's the word for tree?
- Tree is traevam.</i>

410
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,400
And the branch?

411
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,700
And when a dragon and rider are truly one,
then they see as one.

412
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,500
<i>And that's "skulblakas ven."</i>

413
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,200
Well, since we've announced ourselves
so spectacularly to the world...

414
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,300
...we're gonna have to find
another way through these hills.

415
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,900
Of course, that would be a lot easier
if you were flying.

416
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,400
<i>Did someone mention flying?</i>

417
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,800
<i>Are you ready to try again, Dragon Rider?</i>

418
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,000
<i>I didn't do so well last time.</i>

419
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,100
<i>We didn't do so well.</i>

420
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,100
<i>You can thank Brom for the saddle.</i>

421
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,900
No, that's not so bad up here.

422
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,200
<i>Not so bad at all.</i>

423
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,700
Yeah!

424
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,300
<i>Lean.</i>

425
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,400
<i>Not that much!</i>

426
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,700
Feel how she moves, Eragon.

427
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,400
How she turns. And when she accelerates.

428
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,300
Come on, let's see what you got.

429
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,000
<i>You want speed? Here we go.</i>

430
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,300
<i>Hold on, Eragon.</i>

431
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,600
<i>You asked for it.</i>

432
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,600
There you go.

433
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,300
<i>When we're truly one...</i>

434
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,500
<i>...you can fight from everywhere,
even from the tail.</i>

435
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,600
<i>I wanna try it.</i>

436
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,200
<i>Maybe not yet.</i>

437
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,200
<i>Oh, it's easy. I can do this.</i>

438
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,000
<i>Maybe not yet.</i>

439
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,400
<i>Maybe not yet.</i>

440
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,100
<i>Maybe I can try this.</i>

441
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,300
<i>Fantastic.</i>

442
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,600
You always see like this?

443
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,300
<i>That's nothing. Watch this.</i>

444
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,200
What's wrong?

445
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,300
<i>Ra'zacs.</i>

446
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,400
Brom.

447
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,800
This time they die. Now, go.

448
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,500
<i>With pleasure.</i>

449
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,700
Come on. Come on.
Eragon, stay out of this.

450
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,900
Lower, Saphira, lower.

451
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,000
<i>Eragon. Above you.</i>

452
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,600
Come on.

453
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,700
Protect your dragon.

454
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:13,000
Your irresponsibility
nearly cost Saphira her life.

455
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,200
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

456
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,600
<i>I'm stronger than he thinks.</i>

457
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,700
Do you not listen to anything I tell you?

458
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,400
"Better to ask forgiveness
than permission."

459
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,500
Your duty is to reach the Varden alive.

460
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,900
Let's talk about truth
before we start talking about duty.

461
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,500
What are you talking about?

462
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,900
I thought we agreed
not to lie to one another...

463
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,200
...Dragon Rider.

464
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,000
<i>Of course.</i>

465
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,300
Not anymore.

466
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,200
Where's your dragon?

467
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,200
Dead.

468
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,600
She was murdered by another rider
with this sword...

469
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,800
...Za'roc.

470
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,400
<i>That sword is a dragon killer.</i>

471
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,900
The rider's name...

472
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,200
...was Morzan.

473
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,900
Galbatorix won him over.

474
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,700
And while she was trying to protect me...

475
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,800
...my dragon was killed.

476
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,500
<i>Better we...</i>

477
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,900
<i>...than our riders.</i>

478
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:03,700
So I set out to search for Morzan.

479
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,700
And I found him.

480
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,300
I took his sword
and I drove it through his heart.

481
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:17,300
And as he died, so did his dragon...

482
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,500
...the last, except for the king's.

483
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,300
So I hid out in Carvahall...

484
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,600
...with a shame...

485
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,300
...I rightly deserved.

486
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:41,300
Because of me,
the days of the Dragon Riders were over.

487
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,600
Then you came.

488
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,300
You both came.

489
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,800
<i>And now the days of the riders
have come again.</i>

490
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,500
Bring me the boy, I said.

491
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,300
Bring me his blood...

492
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,800
...I said.

493
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,200
But you...

494
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,000
...you bring me nothing.

495
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,900
You.

496
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,200
Congratulations.
You've just been promoted.

497
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,900
I tire of this.

498
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,000
I'll bring the boy to me.

499
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,300
Tell me your name.

500
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,200
- Eragon.
- Eragon.

501
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,900
I am Arya, Princess of Ellesméra.

502
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,900
We are allies with the Varden.

503
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,600
You're the only one who can save me.

504
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,600
But how do I find you?

505
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,100
Durza holds me prisoner at Gil'ead.

506
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,000
- Where are you going?
- To find Arya.

507
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,400
How do you know that name?

508
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,700
She's Durza's prisoner.

509
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,300
I'm going to free her.

510
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,600
That's out of the question.
Gil'ead's in the opposite direction.

511
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,300
We can't go start going back.
We're almost there.

512
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:56,200
I won't let you do that.
It's too much of a risk.

513
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,100
The egg was sent to me.
I'll decide what risks I take. Not you.

514
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,800
Eragon, this is more than about just us.

515
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,100
- If I don't, she'll be killed.
- Yes.

516
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,900
And it's a sacrifice she's happy to make...

517
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,700
...because she values your life over hers.

518
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,400
- I won't let her die.
- If she dies...

519
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,100
...then she'll join the countless others
who have died waiting for you.

520
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,600
As the Varden now wait for you.

521
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:25,800
You must try and understand.
It's your life that's important.

522
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,900
I do understand.

523
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,700
One false move, one reckless decision...

524
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,100
...and everything is lost.

525
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,400
<i>It's good to be brave,
but sometimes it's better to be wise.</i>

526
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,200
- Eragon, listen to me.
- Your shame is not mine.

527
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,400
You forgot what it means
to be a Dragon Rider.

528
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,100
I will save her.

529
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,400
<i>- Eragon--
- Please don't, Saphira.</i>

530
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,700
I'm the rider and I say we go.

531
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,500
<i>You'll draw too much attention.</i>

532
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,700
<i>We'll have to wait for night
and I'll go in alone.</i>

533
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,200
<i>Those walls hold death, Eragon.</i>

534
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:31,200
Not today, not for us.
I'm going to save her life. I can do this.

535
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,900
<i>Our power is greatest
when we're together.</i>

536
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,300
We can't truly be together
until I become as strong as you.

537
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,500
Move along, now.

538
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,400
Move faster.

539
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,300
Make way.

540
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,000
Keep up. Come on.

541
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,800
Eragon.

542
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,900
- You shouldn't have come.
- But in the woods...

543
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:24,500
Leave me here. Go. Now.

544
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,100
It's far too late for that.

545
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:33,100
Forgive me if I stare.

546
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:38,200
I knew you were young, but even then
I expected someone a little more...

547
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,100
Well, more.

548
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,700
A young magician.

549
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,600
How quaint.

550
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,200
Do you already feel it
draining your strength?

551
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,500
They say as a Dragon Rider
draws his last breath...

552
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,300
...he can hear the dying screams
of his dragon.

553
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,100
Out of the way!

554
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,100
No!

555
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,700
You'll have to do much better than that.

556
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,600
- Get out.
- No. Not without you.

557
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,300
Come on. Let's go.

558
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,900
Go.

559
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,700
Take Za'roc.

560
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,000
Saphira, can you carry three?

561
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,000
<i>Not for very long.</i>

562
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,600
I suggest you leave quickly.

563
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,600
Come on. Let's get out of here.

564
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,500
Come on.

565
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,400
- Archers ready.
- Over here.

566
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,500
Higher. They're on the roof.

567
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,500
<i>I can't. The weight, it's too much.</i>

568
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,400
Eragon?

569
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,300
Durza...

570
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,800
- Durza...
- Durza's dead.

571
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,700
Did you pierce him through the heart?

572
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,900
You can only kill a Shade
if you pierce him through the heart.

573
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,500
- We must get help.
- Where?

574
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,000
- From the Varden.
- Yes.

575
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,300
Go to the Varden.

576
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,400
Take this.

577
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,400
Go...

578
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,800
...without me.

579
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,000
No. I need you.

580
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,000
No, Eragon.

581
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:17,200
It's I who've always needed you.

582
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,100
You gave me my life back again.

583
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,900
Take care of Saphira.

584
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,800
Without her...

585
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,600
...you'll find life is hardly worth living.

586
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,400
I won't let you die.

587
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,100
Not for my mistake.

588
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,100
You are not strong enough...

589
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,900
...yet.

590
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,400
That's the spirit.

591
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,100
One part brave, three parts fool.

592
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,300
Forgive me.

593
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:35,300
<i>Eragon. Let him die with pride...</i>

594
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,700
<i>...as a Dragon Rider.</i>

595
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,900
<i>I can't breathe fire yet...</i>

596
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,300
<i>...but I can do this for Brom:</i>

597
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,200
<i>Now time cannot ravage him.</i>

598
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,000
Who will remember him?

599
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,800
Many people will...

600
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,500
...because of you.

601
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,600
<i>Eragon.</i>

602
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,000
<i>A Shade has poisoned her.
Someone's coming.</i>

603
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,400
I need to get you to the Varden.
How do I find them?

604
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,600
<i>- This one's been following us.
- Stand up.</i>

605
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,600
All my life, I dreamed of dragons.

606
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,600
Who are you?
And why are you following us?

607
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,600
I'm Murtagh.
And you need me, Dragon Rider.

608
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,900
- Thanks, but I'll be fine without you.
- You seek the Varden.

609
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:55,000
I know the mountains,
every valley and stream.

610
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,300
She'll suffer if you go astray.

611
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,700
Why did you risk your life for us?

612
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:05,100
My family was slaughtered
by the king's men when I was a boy.

613
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:09,200
I heard rumors.
They said a rider had appeared.

614
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,100
<i>Eragon. We must go.</i>

615
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:19,200
If there were ever a time for retribution,
this was it.

616
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,400
If you can show me
the quickest way to the Varden...

617
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,300
To the Varden it is.

618
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,300
You'll learn to trust me, Dragon Rider.

619
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I'm not the only one
you need to convince.

620
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,200
We'll have to go by foot from here.

621
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,100
<i>Saphira? Keep Arya safe until I call.</i>

622
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:27,100
<i>I will, but hurry. The Urgals are closing in.</i>

623
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,900
Thanks again.

624
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,000
Don't mention it.

625
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,900
Tell me your vision
looked something like this.

626
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,700
Come on.

627
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,200
The task was simple: bring the boy to me.

628
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,800
There were complications.

629
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Yes, so I've heard.

630
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,900
Complications do tend to happen.

631
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:51,500
But fortunately for you,
your incompetence may work in my favor.

632
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,800
The boy has led us directly to the Varden.

633
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,200
And so the job falls upon you, Durza...

634
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:05,000
...to remind those who resist my rule...

635
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:08,400
...that as long as I am king...

636
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:13,500
...disloyalty will be punishable by death.

637
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:19,500
Gather my army and follow them.

638
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:22,700
Leave no one alive.

639
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:27,700
- Move up there.
- Come on, get them on there.

640
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,700
Which one of you is the rider?

641
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,900
I am. My name is Eragon.

642
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,700
I am Ajihad, leader of the Varden.

643
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:43,500
If you are the rider, call your beast inside.

644
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:47,000
If it attacks, you will die first.

645
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,400
<i>Saphira? Bring Arya, but be cautious.</i>

646
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,600
<i>How is Arya?</i>

647
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,200
<i>She's holding on.</i>

648
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:20,300
<i>Her heart beats faintly.</i>

649
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,000
She's been poisoned by a Shade.

650
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,900
Our healers will make her well.

651
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,400
Watch over Arya.

652
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,800
<i>But be careful.</i>

653
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,200
<i>You be careful.</i>

654
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:08,800
- There are Urgals on the mountain.
- Urgals.

655
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,300
They're scouring the mountain
as we speak.

656
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,400
Time is short.
I must know if you're with us.

657
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,500
We'll be greatly outnumbered.

658
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,000
We've come to join you.

659
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,400
- Seize him.
- No.

660
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,700
He's with me. He saved my life.

661
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:58,000
He is the son of Morzan, the traitor.

662
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,200
Is it true?

663
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:06,700
A son doesn't choose his father.

664
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,700
This was the only thing he ever gave me.

665
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,200
I hated that man until the day he died.

666
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:20,100
Lock him up.
If he tries to escape, kill him.

667
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,200
- Let go of me.
- I've no time to take chances.

668
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,500
The Urgals' presence here can only mean
that the king's men are not far behind.

669
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:33,900
These cowards will hide no more.

670
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,500
Tonight, we destroy the resistance.

671
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,400
Annihilate.

672
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,400
But the boy is mine.

673
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:12,600
- Excuse me. I should have knocked.
- It's fine.

674
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,000
My father asked me to bring you to him.

675
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,400
I'll be ready in just a moment.

676
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,100
Arya has responded well
to our healers' work.

677
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,300
- Her strength runs deep.
- When can I see her?

678
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:33,000
She's resting now.
Only she can answer that.

679
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,200
Check those rails.

680
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,300
They're afraid of me.

681
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,800
Why wouldn't they be?

682
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:03,100
There's no retreat from here,
nowhere else to hide.

683
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,000
The suspicion has kept us alive
all these years.

684
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,700
When word spread
of a new Dragon Rider...

685
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,000
...we were expecting someone
who was more...

686
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:18,300
- ...well...
- More than me.

687
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,700
I've heard it before.

688
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,500
More heat. Add more heat.

689
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,500
- Your armor is ready for you.
- Take your positions.

690
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,600
Come on, harder.

691
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,100
We must prepare for battle.

692
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:58,400
It's not as easy as it looks, is it?

693
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,800
You look fit for battle.

694
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,700
- Positions.
- Ready?

695
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,400
Urgals are here.

696
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,500
Be strong, Eragon.

697
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:22,400
The search for a rider
has been long and dangerous.

698
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:25,700
Some of us have carried the egg
for as long as we can remember...

699
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:31,300
...hoping it would hatch,
when fate finally carried it to you.

700
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,900
Why me?
I'm just a farm boy from Carvahall.

701
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:39,400
Because that is who Saphira chose.

702
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:46,600
I barely even recognize myself.

703
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,800
They worked through the night...

704
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,900
...to protect our greatest hope...

705
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,000
...and our leader who rides her.

706
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,500
It's time.

707
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,600
Take your positions.

708
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,400
Ready the archers!

709
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,700
I need to know, Saphira. Why me?

710
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:12,100
<i>You choose a leader for his heart.</i>

711
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,200
But I'm not without fear.

712
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:18,100
<i>Without fear there cannot be courage.</i>

713
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:23,200
<i>But when we are together,
it is our enemies who should be afraid.</i>

714
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,800
And are we together, Saphira?

715
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,900
As one?

716
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,200
I'll take that as a yes.

717
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,000
Loose!

718
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,600
Now!

719
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,800
<i>Into the sky, to win or die!</i>

720
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,000
Fire!

721
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,800
Yeah!

722
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:28,900
Let me out! Let me out!

723
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,900
Let me out of here! Let--!

724
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:17,000
- Oh, no.
- Time to return the favor.

725
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:24,200
I guess we're even!

726
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,500
Come! Taste the blood of your dragon!

727
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:47,800
Let's finish this.

728
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:02,000
What is that thing?

729
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,100
<i>Dark magic.</i>

730
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,700
Closer, so we can reach his heart.

731
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:13,600
<i>This time, rip it out of his chest.</i>

732
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:58,100
Saphira!

733
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:00,100
Hear her scream!

734
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:17,500
Saphira, you're hurt.

735
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,200
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

736
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:22,600
<i>Keep your mind in the fight.</i>

737
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:44,700
What's happening? My vision's failing.

738
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:47,900
<i>It is not you, but me.</i>

739
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,500
<i>This wound weakens me.</i>

740
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:58,800
Easy, Saphira.
We're gonna get through this together.

741
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,600
<i>I'm losing strength.</i>

742
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,500
I know what I have to do.

743
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:30,600
Now!

744
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:42,900
That's for Brom.

745
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,400
I expected more.

746
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,600
Saphira!

747
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:47,200
<i>We did it.</i>

748
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,500
Saphira?

749
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,100
<i>Together.</i>

750
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:02,000
Whatever life there is in me, take it.

751
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:05,200
<i>Eragon, no.</i>

752
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,300
<i>Even you don't have a heart...</i>

753
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:16,600
<i>...strong enough for both of us.</i>

754
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,000
Slowly, rider.

755
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,200
Saphira?

756
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:17,300
Some friends can't be replaced.

757
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,700
Well, luckily, some don't have to be.

758
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:37,000
Saphira. I didn't think I could do it.

759
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:41,400
<i>You shouldn't have. It was reckless...</i>

760
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,200
<i>...but I'm glad you did.</i>

761
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,700
Wasn't it an old, wise man who once said:

762
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:49,800
"One part brave, three parts fool"?

763
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:54,200
<i>Brom would be proud of you.</i>

764
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,000
<i>Of us.</i>

765
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,700
And Arya?

766
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:05,400
Thought that might come up.
Get changed.

767
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:07,800
She's off to Ellesméra.

768
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,600
<i>But what horse was ever born
that could outrun a dragon?</i>

769
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,000
You never gave me a chance
to say goodbye.

770
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:04,500
There was no time.

771
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:07,800
Galbatorix will try to avenge this defeat.

772
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:10,300
I must return to my people in Ellesméra.

773
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,700
And you must prepare the Varden.

774
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,900
You lost those who were dear to you.

775
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:24,500
You've paid a great price for your courage.

776
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:31,600
Did you know the people of the Varden
already tell stories about you?

777
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,800
Legend of Eragon,
the great Shade-slayer...

778
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,800
...spreads throughout Alagaësia.

779
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,600
Well, you know how legends go.

780
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,400
People will believe
just about anything these days.

781
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,500
When will I see you again?

782
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:55,700
Time moves quickly.

783
01:35:55,900 --> 01:36:00,700
Only yesterday you were a farm boy.
Today you are a hero.

784
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:07,000
Tomorrow may see us together again.

785
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:13,000
Then I'll be waiting for tomorrow.

786
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:23,000
<i>Tomorrow will come...</i>

787
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:25,800
<i>...sooner than you think.</i>

788
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Take care of him, Saphira.

789
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,900
<i>I will.</i>

790
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,700
Come.
