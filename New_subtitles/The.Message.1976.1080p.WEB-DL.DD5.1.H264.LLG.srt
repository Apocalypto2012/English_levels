1
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,482
"In the name of Allah, Most
Gracious, Most Merciful."

2
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,484
'From Mohammad, the Messenger of Allah,
to Heraclius, emperor of the Romans.

3
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:45,515
Peace with those which followed Islam.

4
00:02:46,443 --> 00:02:50,686
I invite you to hear the call of Islam.

5
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:55,598
Converted to Islam and you will be
saved, Allah will reward you doubly.

6
00:02:56,234 --> 00:03:00,180
And if you are diverted, you will
carry the sin of all Christians. '

7
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:07,143
He speaks of a new prophet in Arabia.

8
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:10,275
Was he like this, when John
the Baptist, came to King

9
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:13,231
Harod, he came from desert,
crying about salvation?

10
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:44,264
For Cyrus, patriarch of Alexandria.

11
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:01,722
'From Mohammad, the Messenger of Allah,
to Khosro, emperor of the Persia.

12
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:06,228
Converted to Islam and you will be
saved, Allah will reward you doubly.

13
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:10,436
And if you are diverted, you will
carry the sin of all Mazdeans. '

14
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:14,889
You, the barbarian of the desert,

15
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:19,856
you signs prayer with the Persian King?

16
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:30,856
'Mohammad, Messenger of Allah'...
Who gave him this authority?

17
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:32,813
Who gave him this authority?

18
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,098
Allah sent him for the
mercy of the universes.

19
00:05:42,938 --> 00:05:46,552
After Agreement of the responsible
commission of Al-Azhar University,

20
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:50,888
And of High Council Islam of Lebanon,

21
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:54,226
This film was released.

22
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:59,721
"If this Coran were revealed to a mount,

23
00:05:59,937 --> 00:06:02,556
it would collapse even off feared Allah..."

24
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,057
Allah, the Great, said the truth.

25
00:06:05,312 --> 00:06:06,769
The Prophet,

26
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:10,972
elected official by Allah to carry
what the mountains can not,

27
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:17,100
is too great and inaccessible
to be represented by a human.

28
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:22,680
For that we will not see nor his image
neither his voice nor his shade,

29
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:25,009
throughout this film.

30
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:34,217
At the sixth century,

31
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,883
whereas the world is in darkness,

32
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:40,391
was born Mohammad in Mecca.

33
00:06:41,394 --> 00:06:44,061
Mecca is a place of trade,

34
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:48,221
and the cradle of the idolaterist
divinities by the Arabs.

35
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:52,174
During the crowned months, the
tribes defer their conflicts,

36
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:58,680
and the convoys flow, carrying
the offerings to Kaaba.

37
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:17,099
It was built by Abraham prophet
for the believing pilgrims.

38
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:22,637
Now gathers 360 idols, of the
same number as the Arab tribes.

39
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:27,677
Mecca was controlled by Koraichians.

40
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:31,347
Of which Banou Abd Eddar, rich
person and large commercial,

41
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:36,175
who monopolized the maintenance
of the idols to make deals,

42
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:39,183
and Banu Hashim, grandfather of Mohammadâ€¦

43
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:42,514
who preferred to accomodate the
pilgrims during their stay.

44
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:16,551
Lord Omayya.

45
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,009
Bilal!

46
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:39,300
- That is not enough. - How?

47
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:42,135
I refunded more than my debt.

48
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:45,589
That made five years that I refund.

49
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:49,637
You do not know only that doubles?

50
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,965
That doubles.

51
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,424
He is with you?

52
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,799
I need some to plow, it is
all that it remains me.

53
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:06,721
The ass does not even pay half.

54
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,218
The boyâ€¦

55
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:10,426
My son?

56
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:22,468
How you find the market?

57
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:27,303
I can not decide yet, the
caravans continue to arrive.

58
00:09:27,764 --> 00:09:30,253
This year, the idols bring back gold.

59
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:35,676
If you combined idolatry and trade,

60
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:39,472
one would collect more, Abu Sofyan.

61
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,798
I see the caravan of Syria.

62
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:48,168
It is in advance.

63
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:50,965
Add five men to the northern well.

64
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:53,176
How many cuts the throat of sheep, 70?

65
00:09:53,347 --> 00:09:55,716
Hundred. For the prestige of Mecca.

66
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,969
And ten lambs for their chiefs.

67
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,676
Who said to the people

68
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:11,002
that the money was laudatory,

69
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:12,803
when it is wasted?

70
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:14,250
And that, preserved,

71
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:16,467
it became abusive?

72
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:26,837
Whit which of other that Abu Sofyan, the
courageous one and the generous one,

73
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:32,335
can one require help?

74
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:34,801
Here, son of the Harb.

75
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:37,672
Thanks to him pass your caravans,

76
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,256
where good seems to them,

77
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,342
finding in this ground the respect.

78
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:45,134
He hold in high regard poetry,

79
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,924
for which he spends without counting,

80
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:50,381
because the poems are light breezes.

81
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,049
The silk of China, Madam.

82
00:11:05,636 --> 00:11:07,177
Soft with the touch.

83
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:12,383
A pleasure for the eyes.

84
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:16,291
Yes, seven lengths.

85
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:17,797
Twenty dinars.

86
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:21,129
For the woman of Abu Sofyan?

87
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,300
Your price will be mine.

88
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:26,706
Fifteen.

89
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:51,423
It is well. With each idol its share,

90
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:53,710
the pledge of its immortality.

91
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:07,123
Abu Lahab, the man upright over there,

92
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,257
who is this?

93
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:13,758
Carry far me from here,

94
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:16,630
He stripped me of all.

95
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:22,548
Why Mohammad follows us it?

96
00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:25,087
What did it arrive to my nephew?

97
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:28,126
Give him to place.

98
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,374
Perhaps he will change.

99
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,583
At forty years?

100
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:39,339
He is improper for a ripe man
to insulate himself in a cave,

101
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:44,583
and to prefer the nudity of
the caves to a soft bed.

102
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:48,836
Being the husband of a rich woman,

103
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:50,335
like Khadija,

104
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:53,506
can offer what there is best.

105
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:59,795
A man who dares to enrage Ozza?

106
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:03,672
And Manat, god of our prosperity,

107
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:06,673
and Al-Lat,

108
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:09,294
god of our origins and our virtues.

109
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:11,335
And Houbal,

110
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:16,295
on which our destiny depends and
who takes care on our caravans.

111
00:13:16,465 --> 00:13:18,041
This man,

112
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,419
court with its loss.

113
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:23,749
To disavow the divinities as a public,

114
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:26,457
is dangerous.

115
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:30,460
- It is a heresy. - An abjuration.

116
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:32,166
Insubordination.

117
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,120
I am afraid for him.

118
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:51,454
Sadness seizes me each time
the market is emptied.

119
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:54,080
Perhaps that predicts,

120
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:58,211
that I will re-examine it never again.

121
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:05,420
- Abu Taleb!

122
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:12,666
- Abu Taleb! - Gently, Zayd.

123
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,002
Mohammad is descended from the Hira cave?

124
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:18,964
Not, we did not see he yet.

125
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:22,253
Khadija sent to me, thinking
that he was at home.

126
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,335
He is perhaps at Abu Bakr.

127
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:26,537
Not, I went to see.

128
00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:29,244
Then it must be in the cave.

129
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:31,253
Since three days?

130
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,915
There remained a long time this time.

131
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:39,495
I am afraid for him in the mountain.

132
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,375
Because I am unaware of his goal.

133
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:48,580
The man sees the world beter,

134
00:14:49,046 --> 00:14:51,581
the top of a mountain.

135
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:25,120
"Read!

136
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:28,953
Read, in the name of your Lord who created.

137
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:32,330
He created human from a clot of blood.

138
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:37,205
Read! And thy Lord is Most Bountiful,
who taught to write with the pen.

139
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:40,706
Taught human what he knew not."

140
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:20,157
He is always draped in his cape.

141
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:24,495
The revelation weighs on him.

142
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,322
Hardly arrives at raising the hand.

143
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:32,873
He is taken tremors,

144
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,660
whereas its face beads of sweat.

145
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:39,917
But he spoke.

146
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:41,458
Zayd!

147
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:46,244
What arrived at Mohammad?

148
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,498
He was alone,

149
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,621
he meditated in the cave.

150
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:01,910
The angel appeared to him
and he says to him: "Read!"

151
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:08,494
Mohammad answered: "I can not read."

152
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:13,372
The angel repeated several times to him:

153
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,574
"Read!"

154
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,404
And Mohammad answered:

155
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,368
"What must I read?"

156
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,823
The angel of the revelation says then:

157
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,497
"Read, in the name of
your Lord who created.

158
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:35,916
He created human from a clot of blood.

159
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:41,331
Read! And thy Lord is Most Bountiful,
who taught to write with the pen.

160
00:17:42,124 --> 00:17:44,695
Taught human what he knew not."

161
00:17:45,707 --> 00:17:47,497
And Mohammad read.

162
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:52,320
As if the verses had been
written in his heart.

163
00:17:54,457 --> 00:17:56,033
Then Gabriel from him went away.

164
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,283
Gabriel?

165
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,695
When Mohammad left the cave,

166
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,622
he intended a voice of the sky to say:

167
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,996
"- Mohammad!

168
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:11,278
You are the Messenger of Allah.

169
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:13,198
And I am Gabriel."

170
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:17,239
And Mohammad from went away at his place,

171
00:18:17,456 --> 00:18:20,241
to tell Khadija what had seen.

172
00:18:21,081 --> 00:18:23,202
And she say to him:

173
00:18:23,623 --> 00:18:27,035
"Delighted my friend, and hold good.

174
00:18:27,414 --> 00:18:30,862
Because in the name of
that which has my heart,

175
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:34,743
I wish that you would be the
prophet of this community."

176
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:43,283
Who is well-informed, Zayd?

177
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:50,905
The first to know it were
Khadija, Ali and Abu Bakr.

178
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:53,783
And you.

179
00:18:55,872 --> 00:18:57,364
I am his adoptive son.

180
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:05,446
Are kept to announce in Mecca.

181
00:19:06,663 --> 00:19:09,780
Say him that his uncle who raised him.

182
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:14,369
Will never drop him.

183
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:20,158
Why Mohammad called you?

184
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,865
I answered for the knowledge.

185
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,866
The cave, the angels, it is a heresy.

186
00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:30,983
- That Abu Sofyan says?
- That relates to Banu Hashim.

187
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:37,113
A heresy? It is not new.

188
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:40,696
- That are for Mecca.
- This did not already arrive.

189
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:43,738
In Noah, Moses and Jesus
and with all the prophets?

190
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:52,074
Mousab, who is this?

191
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:54,237
Jaafar.

192
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:09,110
What you hold?

193
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:11,985
A sura of Coran.

194
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:24,739
"In the name of Allah, Most
Gracious, Most Merciful."

195
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:29,743
"When the sun is covered,

196
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,565
And when the stars darken,

197
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:34,569
And when the mountains
are made to pass away,

198
00:20:35,494 --> 00:20:37,863
And when the camels are left untended,

199
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,159
And when the wild animals
are made to go forth,

200
00:20:41,452 --> 00:20:44,023
And when the seas are set on fire,

201
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,569
And when souls are coupled,

202
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,577
And when the female infant
buried alive is asked,

203
00:20:50,743 --> 00:20:53,196
For what sin she was killed,

204
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:59,483
When the Scrolls are laid open,
and when the sky is unveiled,

205
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:02,822
When the Blazing Fire is
kindled to fierce heat,

206
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:06,617
And when Paradise is brought near,

207
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:10,358
Every soul shall then know
what it has prepared."

208
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:13,236
Allah, the Great, said the truth.

209
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:15,439
Jaafar.

210
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,655
You were over there when Allah
revealed these words to him?

211
00:21:21,242 --> 00:21:23,647
He trembled under its cape,

212
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,487
and he claquait teeth.

213
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:33,240
He tried to stop his shivers.

214
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:39,782
Then he awoke and spoke.

215
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,404
It is the daybreak.

216
00:21:58,574 --> 00:22:00,612
Ammar, you initially.

217
00:23:08,447 --> 00:23:09,111
Ammar...

218
00:23:11,697 --> 00:23:13,238
Where you were?

219
00:23:13,406 --> 00:23:16,771
Your mother worries, she did not sleep.

220
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:18,816
Where you were?

221
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:30,819
Forgiveness, it is my fault.

222
00:23:31,238 --> 00:23:35,279
This god helped us all our life.

223
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:42,777
But it did not help itself.

224
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:45,942
I have shame of deifier that.

225
00:23:48,196 --> 00:23:52,190
True Allah is that which sees,

226
00:23:52,696 --> 00:23:54,936
without being seen.

227
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:01,360
Ammar.

228
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:04,773
We see the gods in Kaaba.

229
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,943
Ammar, I am afraid for you.

230
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,688
You listenings of people who will lose you.

231
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:15,018
I listen to Mohammad, Mother.

232
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,315
Mohammad?

233
00:24:17,445 --> 00:24:20,443
All Mecca testifies to its honesty.

234
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:24,818
It are that which gives without counting.

235
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:27,980
Greet everyone.

236
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:32,892
But I do not want only it offends the gods.

237
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,728
Gods?

238
00:24:34,903 --> 00:24:37,687
Which is this god who accepts
that one dies of hunger?

239
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:41,768
That the rich person exploits the poor one?
That the fort oppresses the weak one?

240
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:47,562
Which authorizes the fathers to kill
their daughters without reason?

241
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,309
Are this a god that which...

242
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:53,236
That which prohibits to the
women to choose their husband?

243
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:56,353
And accept that one imposes a
life worse to them than death?

244
00:24:58,694 --> 00:25:02,060
Your mother was not forced.

245
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:03,647
You remember, Yasser?

246
00:25:04,444 --> 00:25:07,477
We would never have met.

247
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:11,353
And you Ammar, you would
not have been born.

248
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:22,932
My father was Abut to bury me...

249
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,396
â€¦alive.

250
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:27,980
Like buried my sister.

251
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,272
But he could not do it,

252
00:25:31,526 --> 00:25:35,816
because he remembered that whereas
he covered her with sand,

253
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:41,063
she clung to one its fingers,

254
00:25:42,526 --> 00:25:44,600
and weas put to suck it,

255
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:49,141
as if it make always,
later says to my mother.

256
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:54,560
Hers pressure was soft.

257
00:25:58,067 --> 00:26:01,018
I think that it was soft.

258
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:06,814
It is a weakness of my father
who saved me the life.

259
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:12,598
It is the habit, Somayya.

260
00:26:13,733 --> 00:26:19,682
It is a sin, and a god who authorizes
it does not deserve a worship.

261
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:28,393
I must join the Prophet.

262
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:40,102
Go ahead, my son. Will join Mohammad.

263
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:42,561
He is a blessed man.

264
00:26:58,524 --> 00:27:01,522
Two men follow him.

265
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:07,561
Read? Read? Mohammad can
neither read nor to write.

266
00:27:07,732 --> 00:27:09,557
But he can speak.

267
00:27:09,732 --> 00:27:11,141
How?

268
00:27:11,315 --> 00:27:13,436
He can speak?

269
00:27:13,607 --> 00:27:16,012
Me also, I can speak.

270
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,848
That Mohammad says?

271
00:27:18,106 --> 00:27:21,188
He say only what one reveals
to him of the words of Allah.

272
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:24,023
Which words? And which Allah?

273
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:26,387
A god who speaks!

274
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:29,680
Mohammad is delirious.

275
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,266
Retain all that one reveals to him.

276
00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:36,846
Then he dictate it with
those which transcribe it.

277
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:39,725
The words of Allah are unchanged.

278
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:41,396
It is Coran.

279
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:44,640
Mohammad is famished for his dreams.

280
00:27:44,814 --> 00:27:48,226
You do not say that he hides
under his cape the closed eyes?

281
00:27:48,939 --> 00:27:51,427
Yes, but his heart is open.

282
00:27:52,022 --> 00:27:55,103
You, it for his eloquence strikes.

283
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:56,469
Not.

284
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,636
It is not a solution.

285
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:02,887
Mohammad does not realize it,

286
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:06,061
that our life depends on the gods of Kaaba?

287
00:28:07,022 --> 00:28:09,261
Kaaba belongs to us.

288
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,009
Every year, the caravans arrive,

289
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,306
make it tower of Kaaba and buy our goods.

290
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:22,266
It is not so easy, my boy.

291
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:26,391
How to replace 300 gods
by only one, invisible?

292
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:30,010
You say that is everywhere, here, at home,

293
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:34,016
in Taif, Medina, Yemen, on the moon!

294
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:41,390
That the pilgrims would visit
while coming in Mecca,

295
00:28:41,771 --> 00:28:46,262
if they can adore only one Allah
whom they find everywhere?

296
00:28:47,062 --> 00:28:51,138
The gods are for Koraichians,
a worship and a trade.

297
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,926
Allah is not goods.

298
00:28:54,478 --> 00:28:56,019
The whip will correct you.

299
00:28:57,478 --> 00:29:00,595
Take guard with you and pay attention.

300
00:29:00,853 --> 00:29:03,009
I have a question!

301
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:09,473
It appear that this illiterate bed that
the slave is the equal one of his Master.

302
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:14,471
Bilal, this Black that
I bought, my is equal?

303
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,851
Yes... if it is a human being.

304
00:29:18,644 --> 00:29:20,018
The Prophet says as:

305
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:23,267
"The men are equal like
the teeth of a comb."

306
00:29:23,811 --> 00:29:27,851
This heresy tries the slaves and their
fact of hoping for the delivery.

307
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:29,515
Bilal...

308
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:37,971
Teach to this boy the difference
between a Master and his slave.

309
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:39,767
Give him the whip.

310
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:46,637
So that it can not pronounce
one word any more.

311
00:29:49,477 --> 00:29:51,514
Bilal, whips it.

312
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:53,465
Whip it.

313
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,055
Kill it.

314
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,724
Whip it.

315
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:24,176
Obeyed.

316
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:27,889
Obeyed them.

317
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:42,931
Do it.

318
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,304
Save your heart.

319
00:30:48,475 --> 00:30:52,172
Disorder invaded Mecca
and reached our slaves.

320
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,181
Same if you are a man who has gods,

321
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:57,842
they must be ours.

322
00:30:58,016 --> 00:31:02,757
Your body and your heart belong
to me since I bought to you.

323
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:05,347
I will correct you.

324
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:24,678
The Single One.

325
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:26,840
Allah is the Single one.

326
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:36,214
Which is strongest?

327
00:31:37,224 --> 00:31:40,008
The Single One... The Single Oneâ€¦

328
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:43,012
- Answer. - The Single One.

329
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,051
Your Master or your single Allah?

330
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:51,919
The Single One...

331
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,844
Allah is the Single one.

332
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:23,971
You did not complete it?

333
00:32:28,305 --> 00:32:32,299
This slave does not shout of
pain, it assembles the slaves.

334
00:32:32,722 --> 00:32:33,586
Omayya!

335
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:36,631
Omayya!

336
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:48,047
Abu Bakr proposes hundred dinars
more to you than the price of Bilal.

337
00:32:48,221 --> 00:32:49,714
Wait.

338
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:52,215
Wait.

339
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:55,091
One do not sell a slave
during his punishment.

340
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:57,627
Let negotiate it.

341
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:00,920
Two hundred dinars, Omayya.

342
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,668
Abu Bakr? That wants to say Mohammad.

343
00:33:06,054 --> 00:33:09,254
After the higher bid of the slaves,

344
00:33:12,387 --> 00:33:15,800
we will nourish our animals
ourselves the next year?

345
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:27,375
Take it, I do not want it more.

346
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,457
You must obey me of my alive.

347
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,841
Why you put your father in anger?

348
00:33:40,928 --> 00:33:43,002
If I drank alcohol,

349
00:33:43,178 --> 00:33:48,214
in the streets of Mecca, I trailed
would satisfy my father, sister?

350
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:51,419
Do not call me 'sister'. - What you make?

351
00:33:51,678 --> 00:33:54,380
You are all my children.

352
00:33:58,053 --> 00:34:01,833
And you, I will give you what you wish,

353
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:04,175
what you will want.

354
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:07,757
Mohammad gave me serenity and peace.

355
00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:10,627
Let leave it.

356
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,423
That it joins converted,

357
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,338
do not it for us,

358
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:30,711
but have pity of your father.

359
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:41,955
Hudayfa, wait!

360
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:49,043
Your nephew insults our
gods and our fathers,

361
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:53,248
and corrompt our children.

362
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:55,420
Step so quickly, Abu Hakam,

363
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,960
step so quickly.

364
00:34:58,134 --> 00:35:01,002
I would not have let it sow the disorder.

365
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:05,380
The most courageous young
people of Mecca follow him.

366
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,837
And that of us the Arabs will say?

367
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:10,841
That the young people guide the old ones?

368
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:12,917
Abu Taleb, say to me,

369
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:17,798
how the sky would choose an ordinary man?

370
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:22,416
We were very patient with your nephew.

371
00:35:22,592 --> 00:35:25,080
We let us propose a market to him.

372
00:35:25,342 --> 00:35:29,335
If he rejects it, we
will fight against you,

373
00:35:29,508 --> 00:35:32,292
until the defeat of one of the camps.

374
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,504
If he wants money, he
will be richer than us.

375
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:43,292
And if he wants a statute,
he will be our master.

376
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:47,836
If he wants sovereignty,
he will be our king.

377
00:35:55,632 --> 00:36:00,918
If he wants the authority, he
will have the keys of Kaaba.

378
00:36:22,506 --> 00:36:25,623
Now that you heard their request,

379
00:36:27,048 --> 00:36:29,750
Mohammad, my nephew,

380
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:34,127
save to me, and you with.

381
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:42,286
And weighed down not burden of an old man.

382
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:58,539
Mohammad is so great!

383
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:03,417
One offer the world to him and it refuses:

384
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,294
"My Uncle,

385
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:12,129
if they offered the sun in my right
hand to me, the moon in the left,

386
00:37:12,588 --> 00:37:16,629
I would not give up my mission,

387
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:22,711
until Allah me asks it, or which I die."

388
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,917
Allah asked Mohammad to
proclaim his mission.

389
00:37:40,504 --> 00:37:42,376
We leave to protest the truth!

390
00:37:44,337 --> 00:37:46,292
The world must know!

391
00:37:49,629 --> 00:37:54,120
It do not have there other gods
that Allah and we adore only him,

392
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:56,535
devoted to his religion.

393
00:37:56,795 --> 00:38:01,168
Against the non-believers! Allah is great!

394
00:38:01,337 --> 00:38:03,209
It have other gods there only Allah,

395
00:38:04,045 --> 00:38:06,877
and Mohammad is its Messenger!

396
00:38:07,045 --> 00:38:10,078
"In the name of Allah",
we proclaim our message!

397
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:14,033
"In the name of Allah", we leave the shade.

398
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:18,075
Allah is great, Allah is great!

399
00:38:18,336 --> 00:38:23,538
It do not have there other gods that
Allah and Mohammad is its Messenger!

400
00:38:23,794 --> 00:38:27,835
Allah is great, Allah is great!

401
00:38:28,003 --> 00:38:34,248
It do not have there other gods that
Allah and Mohammad is its Messenger!

402
00:39:08,376 --> 00:39:11,125
Koraichians, you hear?

403
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:15,415
You leave bottoms in favour of Mohammad,

404
00:39:15,668 --> 00:39:18,370
to invade Kaaba?
- Not, in the name of Houbal!

405
00:39:18,876 --> 00:39:21,827
Will throw we them in the flames!

406
00:39:22,376 --> 00:39:24,413
A burning fire!

407
00:39:24,668 --> 00:39:29,206
A burning fire, a burning fire!

408
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:36,242
Allah is great! Allah is great!

409
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:40,660
It do not have there other gods that
Allah and Mohammad is its Messenger.

410
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:12,409
Light it.

411
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,905
Protect the Prophet.

412
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,158
"Perish the hands of Abu Lahab!
He will perish!

413
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:40,242
His wealth and what he
earns will not avail him.

414
00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:42,454
He shall soon burn in fire that flames,

415
00:40:42,624 --> 00:40:44,993
His wife shall carry the wood,

416
00:40:45,165 --> 00:40:47,405
Upon her neck a halter of
strongly twisted rope."

417
00:40:54,248 --> 00:40:55,954
Allah is great!

418
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:38,402
Ahead!

419
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:51,527
Leave Mecca!

420
00:41:51,705 --> 00:41:53,494
Liars!

421
00:42:39,203 --> 00:42:41,277
That the world testifies some!

422
00:42:41,995 --> 00:42:43,701
Like all people!

423
00:42:44,037 --> 00:42:47,367
Abu Sofyan, it is the
occasion to complete them.

424
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,990
They are only thirty.

425
00:42:50,745 --> 00:42:53,577
Not, not in Kaba,

426
00:42:53,953 --> 00:42:55,908
not to ennoble them.

427
00:42:56,453 --> 00:42:59,486
You draw aside us from the divine right,

428
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:03,655
of the house of Abraham and all the Arabs.

429
00:43:03,828 --> 00:43:05,569
Allah is great!

430
00:43:05,828 --> 00:43:10,817
Allah is great, Allah is great!

431
00:43:14,452 --> 00:43:15,993
Open!

432
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:37,201
"Say: O unbelievers! I do not
worship that which you worship..."

433
00:43:37,452 --> 00:43:40,533
Move away them from Kaaba!

434
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:48,947
Stop this liar who claims
to know the skies!

435
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:52,491
Protect the Prophet!

436
00:44:07,284 --> 00:44:09,654
Hamza!

437
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,982
Abu Jahl, you are valorous.

438
00:45:07,657 --> 00:45:11,900
You attack disarmed men.

439
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:15,937
They support this impudent...
- The most impudent than you?

440
00:45:16,615 --> 00:45:18,902
You who prevent from expressing yourselves?

441
00:45:19,073 --> 00:45:20,696
Mohammad is a liar.

442
00:45:23,573 --> 00:45:25,647
To me, return if you so hardy!

443
00:45:31,323 --> 00:45:34,902
Nobody wants to face me?

444
00:45:37,656 --> 00:45:41,981
I am in the religion of Mohammad.
I say what he says.

445
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,276
Try of me to divert some.

446
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:11,568
Mohammad, my nephew,

447
00:46:12,113 --> 00:46:14,898
When I cross the desert the night,

448
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:19,776
I realize that Allah is too tall
to be confined between four walls.

449
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,446
Which would have believed that Hamza,

450
00:46:27,655 --> 00:46:31,020
wine amateur and hunter of lions,

451
00:46:31,196 --> 00:46:33,767
would follow Mohammad?

452
00:46:34,238 --> 00:46:36,524
Plus one persecute them,

453
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:39,815
more they become strong.

454
00:46:40,821 --> 00:46:42,977
Where he finds his words?

455
00:46:45,321 --> 00:46:47,276
I do not know, Hind.

456
00:46:49,862 --> 00:46:53,310
How an illiterate man, exceeding forty,

457
00:46:53,529 --> 00:46:59,857
can go down again of a mountain
more eloquent than a poet?

458
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:04,315
If it were only of poetryâ€¦

459
00:47:04,945 --> 00:47:09,567
people believe that they
are the words of Allah.

460
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:15,058
How to fight a man which one
does not know the force?

461
00:47:15,237 --> 00:47:19,017
Mohammad promises milk
and wine rivers to them.

462
00:47:19,195 --> 00:47:21,730
Therefore it is listened to.

463
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,569
It is necessary to dissuade some.

464
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,351
Let us start with weakest.

465
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:31,524
Not!

466
00:47:32,486 --> 00:47:33,979
Ammar!

467
00:47:35,403 --> 00:47:36,066
Mother!

468
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:40,726
- Mother! Mother! - Ammar!

469
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:43,439
Come to find uprightness!

470
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:45,724
Somayya!

471
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:52,311
Not! Not!

472
00:47:52,694 --> 00:47:55,265
Release it! Release it!

473
00:47:55,652 --> 00:47:56,931
Yasser!

474
00:48:02,068 --> 00:48:04,106
Not! Not!

475
00:48:06,485 --> 00:48:08,026
My parents!

476
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:11,478
Come to join them.

477
00:48:12,276 --> 00:48:13,473
Attach it!

478
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,981
Father... Mother...

479
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,979
It do not have there other gods that
Allah and Mohammad is its Prophet.

480
00:48:28,234 --> 00:48:30,225
It do not have there other gods only Allah.

481
00:48:34,067 --> 00:48:37,018
You do not want to say good of our gods?

482
00:48:37,192 --> 00:48:38,472
Say: 'Houbal'!

483
00:48:40,026 --> 00:48:41,020
Say: 'Houbal'!

484
00:48:41,192 --> 00:48:44,723
I attest that there is only one Allah,

485
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,725
and I attest that Mohammad...

486
00:48:47,775 --> 00:48:49,398
Not! Not!

487
00:49:02,358 --> 00:49:03,816
Mother...

488
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:04,931
Pity!

489
00:49:18,733 --> 00:49:22,229
I attest that Mohammad is
the Messenger of Allah.

490
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:37,222
Houbal! Houbal!

491
00:49:47,107 --> 00:49:48,268
Houbal...

492
00:49:55,232 --> 00:49:58,727
Say: 'Houbal the grand!'

493
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,971
Say: 'Houbal', and denies
the religion of Mohammad.

494
00:50:03,398 --> 00:50:04,428
- Houbal.

495
00:50:04,606 --> 00:50:09,098
It do not have there other gods that
Allah and Mohammad is its Messenger.

496
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:10,896
Unhappy!

497
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,388
Where is your single Allah to save you?

498
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,885
Leave, leave, brothers of Islam.

499
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:32,056
Would be patient, Ammar, the
Prophet announced a good news:

500
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:36,351
'Patience with Yasser, the
paradise is promised to you. '

501
00:52:47,143 --> 00:52:49,548
Prophet came.

502
00:52:57,018 --> 00:52:59,222
Messenger of Allah,

503
00:53:01,393 --> 00:53:04,142
how can I raise the head,

504
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:07,973
whereas I betrayed you

505
00:53:09,476 --> 00:53:13,683
and called upon their gods?

506
00:53:19,642 --> 00:53:22,842
Suffering made me lose conscience,

507
00:53:23,475 --> 00:53:25,715
I shouted with the assistance

508
00:53:27,392 --> 00:53:30,343
and they killed my parents under my eyes.

509
00:53:32,725 --> 00:53:36,137
They obliged me to betray
you, o Messenger of Allah.

510
00:53:37,267 --> 00:53:39,802
My Allah, forgives me.

511
00:54:01,558 --> 00:54:03,264
Confidence as a Allah.

512
00:54:05,391 --> 00:54:10,510
You touched the Prophet
and he cried of pity.

513
00:54:11,141 --> 00:54:14,802
You will not be blamed if you
spoke under the constraint.

514
00:54:14,974 --> 00:54:18,386
Allah charges a heart only
according to his capacity.

515
00:54:23,265 --> 00:54:25,588
You are not in safety here.

516
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:30,469
Prophet asks us to leave Mecca.

517
00:54:31,598 --> 00:54:35,758
If you remain, they will kill
you the ones after the others.

518
00:54:35,931 --> 00:54:40,884
He say: 'Go in Abyssinie,
where there is a king,

519
00:54:41,765 --> 00:54:44,431
which does not know the injustice. '

520
00:54:47,806 --> 00:54:49,631
Leave now.

521
00:54:51,014 --> 00:54:52,258
Immediately.

522
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:47,545
Of the riders... Caution!

523
00:58:32,341 --> 00:58:35,837
We found their traces and followed them,

524
00:58:36,091 --> 00:58:38,046
but we turned in round.

525
00:58:38,216 --> 00:58:40,965
And they are thus escaped.

526
00:58:41,882 --> 00:58:44,335
To escape? They volitilized!

527
00:58:44,507 --> 00:58:48,583
Mohammad remained, only the weak ones left.

528
00:58:49,007 --> 00:58:51,791
Forts or weak, they will harm to us,

529
00:58:52,049 --> 00:58:53,920
like with our business.

530
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:57,916
Abyssinie... Amr?

531
00:58:58,173 --> 00:58:59,631
You are not the friend of their king?

532
00:59:02,715 --> 00:59:04,042
I think of being his friend.

533
00:59:04,715 --> 00:59:07,038
Can you use this friendship?

534
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:13,079
I can bring back the runaways.

535
00:59:14,131 --> 00:59:16,501
Go for Abyssinie.

536
01:00:07,421 --> 01:00:11,000
These people... Let us see
how they will be humiliated.

537
01:00:15,254 --> 01:00:17,210
You do not incline yourselves?

538
01:00:18,504 --> 01:00:20,957
We prosternons ourselves
only in front of Allah.

539
01:00:22,004 --> 01:00:25,204
Mohammad said to us that he
was the Messenger of Allah.

540
01:00:25,462 --> 01:00:29,586
The Messenger of Allah? Where
are his miracles, Jaafar?

541
01:00:29,754 --> 01:00:32,835
Had he a rise? Went he on water?

542
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:37,793
Cured he the patients, gave
again the sight or the life?

543
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,625
Where are his miracles, Jaafar?

544
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:42,040
He is right.

545
01:00:43,087 --> 01:00:44,959
The prophets make miracles,

546
01:00:45,129 --> 01:00:48,162
to prove that Allah sent.

547
01:00:49,295 --> 01:00:52,495
The miracle of Mohammad is Coran.

548
01:00:52,837 --> 01:00:53,749
Of the words?

549
01:00:54,003 --> 01:00:55,875
Of the words written by illiterate,

550
01:00:56,128 --> 01:00:57,751
and allotted to Allah.

551
01:00:58,461 --> 01:01:00,535
Excuse you them now?

552
01:01:00,711 --> 01:01:07,241
I know that Allah sent tongues
of fire on the apostles,

553
01:01:08,461 --> 01:01:12,158
so that they can be expressed
in all the languages,

554
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,205
that they were unaware of before.

555
01:01:16,544 --> 01:01:18,369
But I wonder,

556
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:21,577
if such miracles exist still nowadays.

557
01:01:24,627 --> 01:01:26,499
I heard some enough.

558
01:01:26,669 --> 01:01:28,873
Your argument is weak.

559
01:01:35,794 --> 01:01:39,787
We came to flee the injustice
and the suffering.

560
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,951
Mohammad said to us:

561
01:01:43,127 --> 01:01:44,501
'Go in Abyssinie,

562
01:01:44,752 --> 01:01:47,750
where the king does not
treat anybody wrongfully. '

563
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:51,497
What they call injustice
is their right punishment.

564
01:01:52,335 --> 01:01:54,242
Why you send to me?

565
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,291
You form part of people of the Book.

566
01:01:57,376 --> 01:02:00,161
Since you believe in a
God, you will protect us.

567
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:03,618
Your Majesty, their
speech is like a mirage,

568
01:02:03,876 --> 01:02:06,080
that made thirsty, takes for water.

569
01:02:06,251 --> 01:02:10,743
They convinced me. I must
listen to them, my friend.

570
01:02:26,084 --> 01:02:27,327
Your Majesty,

571
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,702
we were people being unaware of,

572
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:35,865
we venerated wood and stone idols,

573
01:02:36,417 --> 01:02:40,873
eaten the carrion, made adultery
and broken the blood ties.

574
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:45,284
We neglected our neighbors and the
rich person oppressed the poor.

575
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:51,077
Until Allah sends a prophet among us,

576
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,283
we know the virtue,

577
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:57,286
the sincerity, honesty and dignity.

578
01:02:57,749 --> 01:03:00,866
It invited us to adore Allah,

579
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:05,153
and to give up our wood and stone gods.

580
01:03:05,624 --> 01:03:08,113
You calumniate our divinities!

581
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:12,290
We do not venerate the wood
or the stone of the idols,

582
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:16,956
but the spirit which resides at
it and bring us closer Allah.

583
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:21,696
Everyone does not see the
things in this way, Amr.

584
01:03:22,624 --> 01:03:24,413
That you your religion orders?

585
01:03:25,582 --> 01:03:29,990
It order to us to venerate
only one single Allah,

586
01:03:30,248 --> 01:03:33,495
to request and say the truth,

587
01:03:33,832 --> 01:03:37,695
to be honest and to respect the
our neighbor and blood ties,

588
01:03:38,082 --> 01:03:40,617
to avoid the taboos and blood.

589
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:43,278
It prohibit adultery and slanderings to us,

590
01:03:43,706 --> 01:03:47,154
to steal the money of the orphan
and to calumniate the pure women.

591
01:03:47,331 --> 01:03:48,789
Pure women?

592
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:51,279
And women?

593
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,456
The woman is equalizes of the man.

594
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:59,111
- She have the same rights. - Which rights?

595
01:03:59,623 --> 01:04:03,070
Let us buy we them and the
infants to be been useful,

596
01:04:03,247 --> 01:04:05,996
and let us sell them if
they refuse to obey.

597
01:04:10,497 --> 01:04:13,614
Mistakes you the woman who
carried you in her belly,

598
01:04:13,872 --> 01:04:17,154
and which nursed to you being small?

599
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:20,780
Until you would be adult, Amr?

600
01:04:21,872 --> 01:04:24,491
Why your gods are dumb?

601
01:04:25,413 --> 01:04:27,570
Their single Allah it overpowered?

602
01:04:29,247 --> 01:04:31,949
Our Allah is that of all.

603
01:04:32,913 --> 01:04:38,613
Allah of Abraham, Moses,
Zacharie, John and Jesus Christ.

604
01:04:38,788 --> 01:04:43,031
They had a revelation, just like Mohammad.

605
01:04:44,455 --> 01:04:46,990
Which taught you these names?

606
01:04:48,496 --> 01:04:50,037
Coran.

607
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:53,653
- It was revealed to Mohammad. - Mohammad!

608
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:56,117
He were only a one orphan shepherd.

609
01:04:56,454 --> 01:04:59,784
And Christ were a ground
carpenter of Allah.

610
01:05:00,037 --> 01:05:04,695
To tell you the truth,
the words of Mohammad,

611
01:05:04,954 --> 01:05:09,362
and those of Christ come
from the same light.

612
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:10,783
Your Majesty,

613
01:05:11,037 --> 01:05:14,035
what they say of Christ will displease you.

614
01:05:14,704 --> 01:05:18,034
- That they of Christ say? - They says...

615
01:05:18,829 --> 01:05:20,570
...that it is a being like us.

616
01:05:21,953 --> 01:05:24,786
Speak... What you of Christ say?

617
01:05:26,828 --> 01:05:31,402
We say of him what Mohammad reported to us.

618
01:05:31,578 --> 01:05:35,951
He is spirit whose words
inspired the Virgin Mary.

619
01:05:36,745 --> 01:05:38,534
And how was born Christ?

620
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:44,032
Your Coran says something
on the birth of Christ?

621
01:05:46,036 --> 01:05:49,946
Yes. Can I quote it?

622
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:58,491
Approach and speak.

623
01:06:05,452 --> 01:06:08,201
"In the name of Allah, Most
Gracious, Most Merciful."

624
01:06:09,077 --> 01:06:10,570
"Relate Mary in the Book,

625
01:06:10,744 --> 01:06:15,697
when she withdrew from her
family to a place in the East.

626
01:06:16,743 --> 01:06:18,864
She placed a screen from them,

627
01:06:19,785 --> 01:06:22,108
then we sent to her our spirit,

628
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:26,072
and he appeared before her
as a man in all respects.

629
01:06:27,868 --> 01:06:29,277
She said:

630
01:06:29,743 --> 01:06:33,357
'I seek refuge from thee to Most
Gracious, if thou dost fear Allah. '

631
01:06:34,993 --> 01:06:36,402
It said:

632
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,989
'I am only a messenger of your Lord,

633
01:06:39,243 --> 01:06:42,525
that I will give you a pure boy. '

634
01:06:44,409 --> 01:06:45,238
She said:

635
01:06:47,159 --> 01:06:53,570
'How shall I have a son, seeing that no man
has touched me, and I am not unchaste?'

636
01:06:55,534 --> 01:06:59,610
It said: 'Even so, your Lord
says: 'It is easy to me,

637
01:07:01,659 --> 01:07:03,982
and that we may make him a sign to men,

638
01:07:04,242 --> 01:07:06,398
and a mercy from us. '

639
01:07:07,284 --> 01:07:09,606
And it is a matter which has been decreed."

640
01:07:12,033 --> 01:07:14,273
Allah, the Great, said the truth.

641
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:41,484
It refer there only this
between our two religions.

642
01:07:43,782 --> 01:07:44,564
Amr,

643
01:07:45,032 --> 01:07:48,978
same for a gold mountain, I do
not would yield them to you.

644
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:56,194
Go with your companions, Jaafar,

645
01:07:56,449 --> 01:08:01,651
and live in peace on this
ground, until your return.

646
01:08:10,448 --> 01:08:12,273
It is intolerable!

647
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:16,404
Mohammad steals us abroad even our allies.

648
01:08:17,698 --> 01:08:19,356
Very well,

649
01:08:19,823 --> 01:08:22,737
will make we a foreigner of here. - Yes.

650
01:08:22,906 --> 01:08:24,482
Which protects here?

651
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:27,572
Abu Taleb? We will isolate.

652
01:08:28,573 --> 01:08:31,938
As well as Banu Hashim. - Yes.

653
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:36,026
More sales with them,

654
01:08:36,572 --> 01:08:37,816
nor of purchases.

655
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,403
More roof to shelter them,

656
01:08:40,572 --> 01:08:43,357
more food, neither sold nor given.

657
01:08:43,781 --> 01:08:46,351
More marriages with them.

658
01:08:47,655 --> 01:08:51,980
Send them in the mountains,
until they give up.

659
01:09:56,862 --> 01:09:59,267
And the years passed.

660
01:10:00,028 --> 01:10:03,310
Mohammad and his partisans were
patient vis-a-vis with misfortune.

661
01:10:04,695 --> 01:10:07,065
And the third year arrived.

662
01:10:07,611 --> 01:10:11,059
Khadija, the mother of believing,
suffered until her death.

663
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:16,854
And Abu Taleb died of sadness.
It was the year of mourning.

664
01:10:29,444 --> 01:10:32,359
Hisham... Zuhayr...

665
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:35,604
- That there is?
- We want to tear the bill.

666
01:10:35,777 --> 01:10:38,609
- A shame. - Withdraw this bill!

667
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:42,771
You are not with Mohammad,
that does not concern you.

668
01:10:43,235 --> 01:10:44,941
We will not fight you.

669
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:49,317
You eat, whereas a part of
our people dies of hunger?

670
01:10:49,568 --> 01:10:52,851
The chiefs of Mecca concluded an agreement,

671
01:10:53,235 --> 01:10:56,849
will not touch you there,
return on your premise.

672
01:10:58,276 --> 01:10:59,390
Let us go there.

673
01:11:04,735 --> 01:11:07,021
It is a plot.

674
01:11:21,651 --> 01:11:23,143
You claimed a miracle,

675
01:11:23,984 --> 01:11:25,774
here in front of you.

676
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:36,061
A miracle achieved by
the weakest creatures.

677
01:11:38,025 --> 01:11:41,889
These termites overpowered you,

678
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,766
humiliated you and destroyed your pride.

679
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:49,808
It is all that it remains you.

680
01:11:51,108 --> 01:11:54,225
Your force is your cruelty.

681
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,563
Your omnipotence and all that you built,

682
01:11:57,733 --> 01:12:00,352
are less in front of the size of Allah.

683
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:04,441
Here your bill, Koraichians.

684
01:12:05,108 --> 01:12:07,857
There remain only these words about it:

685
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:11,473
"In the name of Allah."

686
01:12:13,774 --> 01:12:16,980
"And we shall turn to whatever
deeds they did, and we

687
01:12:16,981 --> 01:12:20,185
shall make such deeds as
floating dust scattered about."

688
01:12:21,691 --> 01:12:23,646
Allah, the Great, said the truth.

689
01:12:24,899 --> 01:12:28,395
Chiefs of Mecca, you cannot flee,

690
01:12:29,149 --> 01:12:32,230
the time and the evils
will be right of you.

691
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:33,560
What a splendour!

692
01:12:33,815 --> 01:12:37,856
Hamza the hunter of lions
drives out the insects!

693
01:12:38,273 --> 01:12:39,647
Yes.

694
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,391
Today and tomorrow, Hind.

695
01:12:50,648 --> 01:12:56,929
I must bid my farewell with
the life, my hour is close.

696
01:12:57,981 --> 01:13:02,887
But I did not convene you for that.

697
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:06,604
I called you,

698
01:13:07,148 --> 01:13:10,892
for something of more serious still.

699
01:13:14,231 --> 01:13:16,933
I called Mohammad.

700
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:20,890
In order to reconcile you.

701
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:25,187
But if he invites us to do what we refuse?

702
01:13:25,355 --> 01:13:28,389
Say to him to stop blaspheme our gods.

703
01:13:29,355 --> 01:13:32,803
We have our religion and he has his.

704
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:36,310
If he accepts it, we will listen to him.

705
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:41,973
It required one word of you.

706
01:13:42,146 --> 01:13:44,765
We would have accepted ten other words,

707
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:49,136
but to say single Allah, not.

708
01:13:52,771 --> 01:13:54,892
You fear...

709
01:13:55,354 --> 01:13:56,930
...of...

710
01:13:57,563 --> 01:13:59,518
...to listen...

711
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:03,555
...what he says?

712
01:14:35,978 --> 01:14:38,597
Are not there another city,

713
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:41,933
that this incredulous city and deaf person?

714
01:14:46,228 --> 01:14:48,514
The sorrows accumulated.

715
01:14:50,228 --> 01:14:54,470
Yesterday, Khadija left us.

716
01:14:56,228 --> 01:14:58,798
It were like a mother for me.

717
01:15:00,602 --> 01:15:02,889
And today, Abu Taleb.

718
01:15:05,061 --> 01:15:08,805
We have in Mecca neither support
any more nor protection.

719
01:15:11,685 --> 01:15:13,392
Sinan,

720
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:18,428
The Prophet wants to move away from Mecca.

721
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:22,675
Immediately... Without delaying.

722
01:15:24,185 --> 01:15:26,934
It want to go in Taif.

723
01:15:30,727 --> 01:15:32,634
Taif?

724
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:36,549
Where there will not be nor Abu Sofyan,

725
01:15:37,685 --> 01:15:41,630
neither Abu Jahl, nor Abu Lahab.

726
01:15:51,268 --> 01:15:54,384
Taif, second Arab city,

727
01:15:54,559 --> 01:15:57,841
went the Prophet with
his adoptive son, Zayd,

728
01:15:58,017 --> 01:16:02,260
in the hope to find of the
assistance near the chiefs of Taif.

729
01:16:02,476 --> 01:16:04,347
After his despair in Mecca.

730
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:20,885
People, fear Allah!

731
01:16:21,933 --> 01:16:23,758
Fear Allah!

732
01:16:31,308 --> 01:16:33,879
People, fear Allah!

733
01:17:03,015 --> 01:17:03,845
You are Christian?

734
01:17:05,974 --> 01:17:10,927
Of Naynawa... Give him that.

735
01:17:33,806 --> 01:17:35,927
It bleed of the feet.

736
01:17:42,806 --> 01:17:44,796
It request Allah.

737
01:17:54,097 --> 01:18:00,460
"O Allah! With you, I lime pits of
my weakness and my lack of skill,

738
01:18:02,555 --> 01:18:05,755
vis-a-vis with these men,
o you Most Merciful.

739
01:18:09,638 --> 01:18:13,217
You are the Lord of weak
and you are my Lord.

740
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:17,379
A which give me you?

741
01:18:18,263 --> 01:18:20,752
A dour foreigner,

742
01:18:22,555 --> 01:18:25,552
or one enemy to whom you yielded to me?

743
01:18:27,763 --> 01:18:31,294
If you are not in anger against
me, I would not be done any,

744
01:18:32,638 --> 01:18:35,091
your safety is more important to me.

745
01:18:38,596 --> 01:18:42,092
I take refuge under the light of your face,

746
01:18:43,387 --> 01:18:46,551
which improved the life and beyond.

747
01:18:49,387 --> 01:18:51,757
Do not make me undergo your anger,

748
01:18:53,637 --> 01:18:56,256
or to fall under your curse.

749
01:18:59,387 --> 01:19:02,420
I go back to you until your satisfaction.

750
01:19:04,012 --> 01:19:06,926
It have there of force and
power only as a Allah."

751
01:19:11,886 --> 01:19:14,173
I advise you to leave.

752
01:19:15,345 --> 01:19:18,259
Taif is not any more one sure place.

753
01:19:23,386 --> 01:19:26,254
It did not know worse day.

754
01:19:34,094 --> 01:19:37,625
And Allah accept, prayers of its prophet.

755
01:19:37,969 --> 01:19:42,709
One year before, of the pilgrims
had recognized Islam in secrecy.

756
01:19:42,885 --> 01:19:44,841
And at the time of the
following pilgrimage,

757
01:19:44,842 --> 01:19:46,796
without the knowledge
of Koraichians,

758
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:50,790
came from Aws and Khazraz,
the enemies of always,

759
01:19:51,094 --> 01:19:54,424
to promise immunity and the support to him.

760
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:57,427
They requested the Prophet
to come on their premises,

761
01:19:57,593 --> 01:20:00,959
to save their city of hatreds and the ruin.

762
01:20:01,135 --> 01:20:03,540
But the allegiance did not take place,

763
01:20:03,718 --> 01:20:06,337
that after having specified
the extent of it.

764
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:08,758
Wait.

765
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:11,547
With this promise,

766
01:20:11,926 --> 01:20:14,675
you oppose to all the polytheists.

767
01:20:15,718 --> 01:20:19,711
You promise that the foreign
Muslims will be your brothers,

768
01:20:20,468 --> 01:20:24,840
and inaccurate your enemies even
if they are of your family.

769
01:20:25,009 --> 01:20:28,339
You promise to destroy your stone idols,

770
01:20:29,092 --> 01:20:33,465
and to break and burn your wood fetishes.

771
01:20:33,884 --> 01:20:35,460
People,

772
01:20:35,842 --> 01:20:40,381
if you think of supporting
that, make act of allegiance,

773
01:20:40,759 --> 01:20:45,463
and if you have fears, abstain from.

774
01:20:47,675 --> 01:20:49,962
In the name of that which sent to you,

775
01:20:51,217 --> 01:20:56,834
we promise to defend you
as we defend our children,

776
01:20:57,467 --> 01:20:59,173
and our families.

777
01:20:59,341 --> 01:21:01,711
Let us promise we him with the Prophet.

778
01:21:01,883 --> 01:21:05,414
And which violates this oath, will
undergo the consequences of them.

779
01:21:05,591 --> 01:21:08,080
We believe in a Allah and his Messenger.

780
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:10,586
Us, Aws and Kahzraj.

781
01:21:11,008 --> 01:21:12,833
We are its partisans.

782
01:21:13,258 --> 01:21:16,339
We promise to the Prophet to obey to him,

783
01:21:17,216 --> 01:21:19,123
to make triumph Islam,

784
01:21:19,383 --> 01:21:22,380
ourselves, with our children,

785
01:21:22,549 --> 01:21:24,125
and our goods,

786
01:21:24,507 --> 01:21:27,671
and to open our hearts and our doors,

787
01:21:28,132 --> 01:21:31,912
with exiled, our brothers in Islam.

788
01:22:17,214 --> 01:22:19,703
Then came the day from separation.

789
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:21,956
Of the shade towards the light,

790
01:22:22,131 --> 01:22:25,413
Them emigrated left by groups,

791
01:22:25,589 --> 01:22:28,836
The single Allah not leaving their hearts.

792
01:22:30,755 --> 01:22:34,963
Among exiled for the divine
cause: Othmane Ibn Affane,

793
01:22:35,214 --> 01:22:38,745
Abd Al Rahman Ibn Awf,
Obayda Ibn Al Jarrah,

794
01:22:38,922 --> 01:22:40,628
Omar Ibn Al Khattab,

795
01:22:40,797 --> 01:22:45,288
and all powerful Koraichians
which embraced Islam.

796
01:22:47,172 --> 01:22:51,912
They were seventy or to
make this voyage more,

797
01:22:52,088 --> 01:22:55,916
which changed the course
of the history of the man,

798
01:22:56,088 --> 01:22:58,659
and the face of the world.

799
01:22:59,088 --> 01:23:02,086
But the Prophet did not leave Mecca.

800
01:23:02,421 --> 01:23:07,125
It waited until the faithful
ones left in all safety.

801
01:23:07,546 --> 01:23:09,418
Allah is great.

802
01:23:09,588 --> 01:23:12,704
And the day when the
Prophet arrives at Medina,

803
01:23:12,962 --> 01:23:17,536
mark the beginning of the Muslim
calendar with the Hegira,

804
01:23:18,712 --> 01:23:22,623
Mohammad became a nation,
received a city, Medina,

805
01:23:23,712 --> 01:23:27,409
He treated with your people
during your sleep, Ibn Souloul.

806
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:32,284
You lost your kingdom yesterday
whereas you dreamed of glory.

807
01:23:32,462 --> 01:23:36,123
Do not make me reproaches, you
are between its hands now.

808
01:23:36,753 --> 01:23:40,000
Your caravans will go to Syria
only while leaving in secrecy,

809
01:23:40,462 --> 01:23:44,242
or after the authorization
of the new chief of Medina.

810
01:23:44,961 --> 01:23:47,201
And you, whom you make?

811
01:23:47,461 --> 01:23:50,128
I will wait... and watch for.

812
01:23:50,628 --> 01:23:51,492
How long?

813
01:23:52,336 --> 01:23:55,251
Until the Arabs raise
themselves to crush it,

814
01:23:55,628 --> 01:23:58,081
and that you take again your way of life.

815
01:23:58,878 --> 01:24:01,413
And during this time,
which will be your role?

816
01:24:02,669 --> 01:24:04,079
I will convert with Islam.

817
01:24:04,878 --> 01:24:08,409
To leave him my birthplace? That, not!

818
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:13,043
Medina deserves the sacrifice
- It is hypocrisy.

819
01:24:14,252 --> 01:24:18,198
Yes, Hind, hypocrisy and conversion.

820
01:24:18,627 --> 01:24:21,116
Ibn Souloul embraces Islam?

821
01:24:21,794 --> 01:24:26,036
Put the face on the ground
five times per day?

822
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:30,122
I do not believe in it.
- Will perhaps not be obliged there.

823
01:24:30,377 --> 01:24:33,825
If the things occur well, Ibn Souloul.

824
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:37,449
We prepare a plan which
has before escaped us.

825
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:40,285
Mohammad...

826
01:24:41,001 --> 01:24:43,039
...will be killed.

827
01:24:43,585 --> 01:24:45,492
Come to see.

828
01:24:46,168 --> 01:24:49,249
We worked out a plan to kill Mohammad.

829
01:24:55,751 --> 01:25:00,787
Young person of each tribe,
of which my Akrima son.

830
01:25:03,167 --> 01:25:06,000
They will strike he all of a blow.

831
01:25:09,417 --> 01:25:12,581
And his blood will be
divided between the tribes.

832
01:25:15,209 --> 01:25:17,246
It is my idea.

833
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,156
That will not put a term at he.

834
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,368
It will remain his call and his words.

835
01:25:26,917 --> 01:25:30,199
But the idea of Abu Hakam
regulate the problem.

836
01:25:31,917 --> 01:25:34,749
And for always.

837
01:26:47,831 --> 01:26:48,743
Not!

838
01:26:49,497 --> 01:26:52,330
Ali slept in his place?

839
01:26:52,789 --> 01:26:55,324
This boy would give him his life.

840
01:26:57,664 --> 01:26:59,987
Contre which fight us?

841
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:03,994
Will not go far! All the
exits are supervised!

842
01:27:04,164 --> 01:27:06,450
It have only the desert in front of him!

843
01:27:08,997 --> 01:27:13,204
Hundred camels to which will bring
back Mohammad living or dead!

844
01:27:14,455 --> 01:27:16,908
They are three: Mohammad, Abu Bakr

845
01:27:17,705 --> 01:27:20,905
and their guide Urayquit,
which knows the desert.

846
01:27:21,163 --> 01:27:22,739
Go!

847
01:27:45,204 --> 01:27:48,617
Why you seek it here?
Medina is by over there.

848
01:27:49,662 --> 01:27:52,992
They are their traces.
- Nomads going towards the west?

849
01:27:53,162 --> 01:27:55,117
- I know my work. â€“ Yes.

850
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:59,578
One say that you find the trace of a
bird thanks to your sense of smell.

851
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:06,741
Let us go with them.

852
01:28:33,703 --> 01:28:35,444
Mohammad,

853
01:28:36,494 --> 01:28:39,445
leave and will bring back
we you to alive Mecca.

854
01:28:39,827 --> 01:28:43,323
Be careful, these caves
are full with snakes.

855
01:28:49,702 --> 01:28:54,359
Mohammad, one found you. Leave from here.

856
01:29:00,202 --> 01:29:03,318
They have nobody there,
the cobweb is intact.

857
01:29:03,493 --> 01:29:07,950
And this pigeon built its nest.
They cannot be here.

858
01:29:08,118 --> 01:29:10,785
Why us to be ventured in the west?

859
01:29:10,951 --> 01:29:13,357
Let us go to the north of Medina.

860
01:29:34,701 --> 01:29:36,775
Allah is the Powerful Whole.

861
01:29:37,659 --> 01:29:40,692
It did not have there
between Mohammad and death,

862
01:29:40,867 --> 01:29:44,647
that some wire of a cobweb.

863
01:29:45,534 --> 01:29:50,156
In the cave, Abu Bakr trembled
for the Prophet and Islam,

864
01:29:50,867 --> 01:29:53,781
and the Prophet whispered
to him with conviction:

865
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,651
"Would not be sad, Allah is with us."

866
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:01,153
They continued their
voyage in full heat wave.

867
01:30:01,325 --> 01:30:04,773
The Prophet, his companion
and their nomadic guide,

868
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:08,860
crossed the desert, that
nobody had never pressed.

869
01:30:15,783 --> 01:30:20,156
Medina, the faithful ones awaited
the arrival of the Prophet,

870
01:30:20,908 --> 01:30:24,356
Theirs hearts burning of fear and pity.

871
01:30:42,449 --> 01:30:45,400
You see something? - Not, not yet.

872
01:30:48,865 --> 01:30:51,733
I am very anxious for him and Abu Bakr.

873
01:30:52,198 --> 01:30:55,066
That of them this furnace made?

874
01:31:32,281 --> 01:31:33,773
Here is the Prophet!

875
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:35,945
Allah is great! Allah is great!

876
01:31:36,197 --> 01:31:37,358
The Prophet!

877
01:31:38,072 --> 01:31:41,935
Here is the guide, the
carrier of a good news!

878
01:32:24,321 --> 01:32:28,777
Will hide you, I do not want to
release to you to make a gesture.

879
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:43,105
Welcome, Messenger of Allah,
with Medina, the luminous one.

880
01:33:43,277 --> 01:33:45,516
Welcome. Welcome.

881
01:33:55,984 --> 01:33:57,975
You will place at home, Messenger of Allah.

882
01:33:58,734 --> 01:34:01,223
My house is most honourable of Medina,

883
01:34:01,401 --> 01:34:05,229
and the worthiest to accomodate
you, if you accept it.

884
01:34:06,109 --> 01:34:08,265
Come rather at home!

885
01:34:10,192 --> 01:34:12,859
Dear inhabitants of Medinaâ€¦

886
01:34:13,567 --> 01:34:16,103
You, community of the partisans,

887
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:21,395
The Messenger of Allah
cannot choose among you.

888
01:34:21,817 --> 01:34:23,226
Listen...

889
01:34:23,484 --> 01:34:26,233
The Prophet known as:

890
01:34:26,650 --> 01:34:30,726
'Allah will guide his Camel. ' - Cheer!

891
01:34:31,858 --> 01:34:37,357
Where it will stop, we will
build his mosque and his house.

892
01:34:37,733 --> 01:34:40,517
With the blessing of Allah!

893
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,723
It is an intelligent idea.

894
01:35:00,899 --> 01:35:05,058
The choice of Camel can not offend anybody.

895
01:36:34,896 --> 01:36:38,676
"In the name of Allah"... Let us
build the house of the Prophet here.

896
01:36:42,646 --> 01:36:48,097
And at this place, the first
mosque to request Allah!

897
01:36:52,604 --> 01:36:55,934
Allah is great... Allah is great!

898
01:37:30,395 --> 01:37:33,227
The Messenger of Allah carries bricks?

899
01:37:33,395 --> 01:37:36,262
You did not suffer enough
during your voyage?

900
01:37:37,978 --> 01:37:41,639
Rest, we work.

901
01:37:52,269 --> 01:37:54,592
It want to continue its work.

902
01:37:54,769 --> 01:37:56,843
He say that work is a veneration.

903
01:37:57,019 --> 01:37:59,258
Fifty-three years.

904
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:02,265
And you, you have which age?

905
01:39:29,933 --> 01:39:33,215
It were built with the will of Allah.

906
01:39:33,474 --> 01:39:35,299
How to call with the prayer?

907
01:39:38,182 --> 01:39:41,927
The voice of believing
calls with the prayer,

908
01:39:42,099 --> 01:39:46,175
as indicates it Omar Ibn Al
Khattab and a group of Muslims.

909
01:39:46,974 --> 01:39:48,301
If the Prophet agrees.

910
01:39:52,515 --> 01:39:57,587
The Prophet accepts. Yes...
The voice of the man.

911
01:39:57,765 --> 01:39:58,713
You, Bilal.

912
01:40:07,098 --> 01:40:09,882
Me? - Do not hesitate, Bilal.

913
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:13,425
It is the will of the Prophet.

914
01:40:37,597 --> 01:40:39,552
"Allah is great!

915
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:43,968
Allah is great!

916
01:40:53,055 --> 01:40:55,757
I attest that there is of Allah only God!

917
01:40:57,513 --> 01:41:00,345
I attest that there is of Allah only God!

918
01:41:01,971 --> 01:41:05,752
I attest that Mohammad is
the Messenger of Allah.

919
01:41:07,763 --> 01:41:11,803
I attest that Mohammad is
the Messenger of Allah.

920
01:41:13,971 --> 01:41:16,175
Run to the prayer!

921
01:41:22,554 --> 01:41:24,379
Run to the salvation!

922
01:41:33,387 --> 01:41:35,010
Allah is great!

923
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:45,509
It have there of Allah only God!"

924
01:41:56,470 --> 01:41:58,211
My brothers...

925
01:41:59,095 --> 01:42:02,211
The Prophet called to the emigrants
and to the partisans of Medina:

926
01:42:04,095 --> 01:42:07,674
"Be brothers in front of Allah.

927
01:42:08,511 --> 01:42:12,090
That each man of Medina,

928
01:42:12,344 --> 01:42:14,134
kiss an emigrant of Mecca.

929
01:42:14,303 --> 01:42:18,213
That it makes a brother and
divides all with him of it,

930
01:42:18,969 --> 01:42:22,500
you all like brothers Embrace."

931
01:42:36,219 --> 01:42:39,419
Must I divide my clothing with my slave?

932
01:42:39,593 --> 01:42:43,338
Read this, Mohammad was established king.

933
01:42:49,593 --> 01:42:52,295
How my son is?

934
01:42:53,135 --> 01:42:55,753
He request like exaggerated.

935
01:42:59,426 --> 01:43:02,590
That does not burn the hands?

936
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:06,380
It will burn the house
if it is not destroyed.

937
01:43:06,634 --> 01:43:10,082
He order, prohibit and enact the laws.

938
01:43:10,468 --> 01:43:14,461
His honesty towards Islam would be
higher than that towards tribe.

939
01:43:14,967 --> 01:43:16,508
How?

940
01:43:16,759 --> 01:43:19,591
The Koraichians Muslims and of Medina,

941
01:43:20,551 --> 01:43:23,833
and those which followed them and joined,

942
01:43:24,092 --> 01:43:27,292
and which fought near
them, form a community,

943
01:43:27,467 --> 01:43:29,671
would not be easily deceived.

944
01:43:29,842 --> 01:43:32,591
It will not be able to
unify the Arab tribes.

945
01:43:32,759 --> 01:43:34,879
The danger comes from there.

946
01:43:35,758 --> 01:43:39,455
"The neighbor is like oneself,
neither malfaisant nor sinning.

947
01:43:39,883 --> 01:43:43,414
One see a woman only with the
agreement of its family."

948
01:43:43,925 --> 01:43:45,797
It really think it.

949
01:43:46,050 --> 01:43:49,297
For him, the Muslims and
people of the Book are equal.

950
01:43:49,466 --> 01:43:52,334
Read what he says of the Jews of Medina.

951
01:43:52,508 --> 01:43:56,667
"The Jews have their religion
and the Muslims theirs,

952
01:43:56,841 --> 01:43:59,673
themselves and their owners,

953
01:43:59,924 --> 01:44:01,714
except that which oppressed and sinned."

954
01:44:01,883 --> 01:44:03,589
Look at.

955
01:44:04,674 --> 01:44:07,707
The woman has rights, of
which that of the heritage.

956
01:44:07,882 --> 01:44:11,129
And why not of the rights for the camels?

957
01:44:11,341 --> 01:44:15,286
Coran known as: "There is
not an animal on the earth,

958
01:44:15,549 --> 01:44:20,420
nor a being that flies on its
wings, but communities like you..."

959
01:44:21,632 --> 01:44:26,005
Mohammad upsets all, even
the nature of my city.

960
01:44:27,674 --> 01:44:29,214
Curse is it!

961
01:44:30,382 --> 01:44:33,333
He steal us our children and our lives.

962
01:44:33,715 --> 01:44:35,706
He found what he calls the right,

963
01:44:35,965 --> 01:44:37,837
At the expense of our future.

964
01:44:38,007 --> 01:44:39,665
That are enough!

965
01:44:41,798 --> 01:44:43,836
He should be given to its place.

966
01:44:53,714 --> 01:44:56,878
Whole that exiled left in Mecca,

967
01:44:57,214 --> 01:44:58,790
will confiscate we it.

968
01:44:58,964 --> 01:45:03,337
Their houses, their camels,
their horses, their money,

969
01:45:03,506 --> 01:45:07,369
and even their children belong to us.

970
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,576
Exiled!

971
01:45:42,838 --> 01:45:45,540
I bring news of Mecca.

972
01:45:48,838 --> 01:45:51,408
They stole all your possessions.

973
01:45:51,588 --> 01:45:54,041
Do not remain to you any more money.

974
01:45:54,379 --> 01:45:56,666
The trade of Abu Bakr is sold,

975
01:45:57,004 --> 01:45:59,374
as well as the house of the Prophet.

976
01:46:00,254 --> 01:46:03,417
They sold your goods to
inflate their caravans.

977
01:46:04,462 --> 01:46:07,377
It remain to you nothing.

978
01:46:08,462 --> 01:46:11,828
You for your possessions do not fight?

979
01:46:12,004 --> 01:46:14,373
Which speaks to fight?

980
01:46:19,295 --> 01:46:22,293
You Have an alternative?

981
01:46:22,837 --> 01:46:25,621
We will fight only with the
orders of Allah and its Prophet.

982
01:46:26,587 --> 01:46:28,743
Include understand me well,

983
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:32,748
you do not disturb us are our guests.

984
01:46:33,003 --> 01:46:36,120
If there remained to us only one bread,

985
01:46:36,670 --> 01:46:38,660
we would give it to you.

986
01:46:43,878 --> 01:46:46,034
Turn over to work.

987
01:46:52,336 --> 01:46:56,709
Will fight we them, I swear
that we will fight them.

988
01:46:56,877 --> 01:47:01,202
Those which oppressed us, drove
out our houses and plundered.

989
01:47:01,794 --> 01:47:05,076
The good will not be overcome by the evil.

990
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:09,917
We are protected by Allah and
by you, we will overcome.

991
01:47:10,669 --> 01:47:15,373
O Messenger of Allah, I know
that you call with peace.

992
01:47:15,877 --> 01:47:20,036
But if we let them make,
we will lose our honor.

993
01:47:22,210 --> 01:47:23,868
Let us fight them.

994
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:32,325
Whole that we have finds in their caravans.

995
01:47:32,501 --> 01:47:35,120
Their caravans are within reach,

996
01:47:35,376 --> 01:47:38,623
let us recover our goods by the force.

997
01:48:04,542 --> 01:48:06,331
Forgive me.

998
01:48:06,834 --> 01:48:11,704
Forgiveness if I raised
the voice your involved.

999
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,282
But it is an anger for
Allah and his religion.

1000
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:21,112
Engagements them.

1001
01:48:33,833 --> 01:48:36,403
No battle, without the order of Allah.

1002
01:48:49,082 --> 01:48:51,156
Allah is great!

1003
01:48:52,582 --> 01:48:54,324
Allah is great!

1004
01:48:54,499 --> 01:48:58,444
Bilal. Looks at the sun.

1005
01:49:03,915 --> 01:49:06,747
"I attest that there is of Allah only God."

1006
01:49:10,998 --> 01:49:13,238
It is not the hour of the prayer.

1007
01:49:17,998 --> 01:49:20,403
"I attest that Mohammad is
the Messenger of Allah."

1008
01:49:23,998 --> 01:49:26,284
"Allah is great!"

1009
01:49:33,206 --> 01:49:36,239
"It have there of Allah only God."

1010
01:49:39,122 --> 01:49:42,488
Listen to what Allah
revealed with its Messenger.

1011
01:49:43,997 --> 01:49:46,201
"In the name of Allah, Most
Gracious, Most Merciful."

1012
01:49:47,914 --> 01:49:51,990
"Permission is given to those upon whom
war is made because they are oppressed,

1013
01:49:52,372 --> 01:49:54,528
and verily, Allah is most
powerful for their aid,

1014
01:49:55,330 --> 01:49:58,204
Those who have been expelled
from their homes without a

1015
01:49:58,205 --> 01:50:01,078
just cause except that they
say: 'Our Lord is Allah'..."

1016
01:50:01,913 --> 01:50:03,489
Allah, the Great, said the truth.

1017
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:05,704
Allah is great!

1018
01:50:43,037 --> 01:50:44,944
The sword of Ali,

1019
01:50:45,287 --> 01:50:47,527
is the first sword of Islam.

1020
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:02,741
Exiled and in favour!

1021
01:51:04,078 --> 01:51:06,946
Comply with the rules
of war of the Prophet.

1022
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:11,737
Save the children, the old men,
the women and the patients,

1023
01:51:12,203 --> 01:51:13,944
do not cut down trees.

1024
01:51:14,203 --> 01:51:17,117
Do not make evil with the man
who works with the field.

1025
01:51:17,994 --> 01:51:21,324
Fight your oppressors and
those which have stolen you.

1026
01:51:23,994 --> 01:51:26,945
Now, with the wells of Badr!

1027
01:52:16,576 --> 01:52:19,029
Koraichians!

1028
01:52:24,451 --> 01:52:28,231
You Arm! Defend your goods! Mohammad!

1029
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:32,031
They attack your caravan.
- How much they are?

1030
01:52:32,284 --> 01:52:35,282
Three hundred of which some riders.

1031
01:52:35,450 --> 01:52:39,029
We will have 200 riders. How many camels?

1032
01:52:39,492 --> 01:52:42,822
- Seventy. - We will have 170 of them.

1033
01:52:42,992 --> 01:52:46,985
And twenties of my camels will
carry the wine earthenware jars.

1034
01:52:47,158 --> 01:52:49,030
It will be a festival!

1035
01:52:50,117 --> 01:52:53,114
It is the war which I waited.

1036
01:52:53,283 --> 01:52:55,404
A war without losses.

1037
01:52:55,575 --> 01:52:57,530
The war!

1038
01:53:45,573 --> 01:53:47,315
Go quickly to the caravan.

1039
01:53:47,490 --> 01:53:51,697
Say to Abu Sofyan to go to the
wells of Badr with its men.

1040
01:54:59,029 --> 01:55:00,735
Koraichians left.

1041
01:55:00,904 --> 01:55:04,234
Koraichians went to face
the Muslims with Badr.

1042
01:55:04,404 --> 01:55:06,395
They ask you to join them.

1043
01:55:07,196 --> 01:55:10,775
It is not reasonable to risk
the richnesses of Mecca.

1044
01:55:13,112 --> 01:55:15,352
I go to the west, far
from the well of Badr.

1045
01:55:15,529 --> 01:55:18,147
You must move towards Badr.

1046
01:55:18,654 --> 01:55:22,778
If I continue my walk the night, I
will avoid Mohammad until the morning.

1047
01:55:22,945 --> 01:55:25,101
And your row among your people?

1048
01:55:25,695 --> 01:55:28,266
My position depends on the
safety of these camels.

1049
01:55:28,445 --> 01:55:32,521
Yes, today... My influence
is in these goods.

1050
01:57:14,108 --> 01:57:16,775
Mohammad took the wells of Badr.

1051
01:57:21,358 --> 01:57:25,648
It were thrown between our hands.
Which imprudent.

1052
01:57:25,816 --> 01:57:29,312
The imprudent ones are
always thrown in the abyss.

1053
01:57:55,107 --> 01:57:57,596
Abu Sofyan goes towards the
west and moves away from Badr.

1054
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:02,227
The caravan is thus with the shelter.

1055
01:58:03,607 --> 01:58:05,846
I propose more to beat us.

1056
01:58:06,274 --> 01:58:07,470
Not to beat us?

1057
01:58:07,649 --> 01:58:09,722
Why start a war?

1058
01:58:09,982 --> 01:58:12,352
Which could last forty years?

1059
01:58:13,482 --> 01:58:15,686
A war between fathers and sons?

1060
01:58:15,982 --> 01:58:20,058
Hudayfa, your son is with them
and it deserves the whip!

1061
01:58:21,190 --> 01:58:23,180
Mecca is worth more than him.

1062
01:58:23,481 --> 01:58:25,638
Your truth son is Walid.

1063
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:30,516
Known as that it is of my fault
and that Otba became loose,

1064
01:58:31,898 --> 01:58:35,559
whereas you know that I
am not more the coward.

1065
01:58:35,981 --> 01:58:37,853
Me I say, make the war.

1066
01:58:39,398 --> 01:58:41,554
It is our only chance.

1067
01:58:41,981 --> 01:58:46,851
If we lose it, we will not
have of it an other. The war!

1068
01:58:47,106 --> 01:58:49,310
The war!

1069
01:59:22,563 --> 01:59:24,103
You finished?

1070
02:00:21,853 --> 02:00:23,927
Your places, dispatch you take!

1071
02:00:25,894 --> 02:00:26,593
You dispatch!

1072
02:00:33,144 --> 02:00:34,685
In place!

1073
02:00:37,936 --> 02:00:41,881
Position of combat! With your places!

1074
02:02:10,933 --> 02:02:13,007
Mohammad stopped the wells.

1075
02:02:14,349 --> 02:02:16,838
We must reach the other well.

1076
02:02:33,849 --> 02:02:35,721
Do not leave your places.

1077
02:02:36,349 --> 02:02:38,837
Until the order of the Prophet.

1078
02:02:39,432 --> 02:02:41,636
If the enemies surround you,

1079
02:02:41,807 --> 02:02:44,509
sift to them arrows!

1080
02:03:43,972 --> 02:03:47,088
Send to us your champions!

1081
02:04:06,054 --> 02:04:07,547
Which are you?

1082
02:04:08,929 --> 02:04:10,719
Mohammad!

1083
02:04:11,346 --> 02:04:15,126
Send to us our equal among our people.

1084
02:04:20,429 --> 02:04:22,135
Return!

1085
02:04:28,262 --> 02:04:29,210
Shaiba my brother,

1086
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:32,843
Walid my son,

1087
02:04:34,887 --> 02:04:36,130
and myself.

1088
02:04:38,970 --> 02:04:41,256
Await you.

1089
02:04:44,803 --> 02:04:46,212
Ubayda,

1090
02:04:48,345 --> 02:04:51,378
Myself... and Ali.

1091
02:04:58,344 --> 02:05:00,667
The Prophet known as:

1092
02:05:00,969 --> 02:05:03,967
"Those which have the heart of
Mohammad between their hands.

1093
02:05:04,136 --> 02:05:06,920
Whole man which fights them,

1094
02:05:07,261 --> 02:05:10,128
die patient and circumspect,

1095
02:05:10,344 --> 02:05:12,667
and advance without hesitating,

1096
02:05:12,886 --> 02:05:15,090
Allah will make it enter to the paradise."

1097
02:06:11,759 --> 02:06:13,749
Let us be us your equal?

1098
02:06:14,467 --> 02:06:16,872
It have there of another Allah only God.

1099
02:06:17,134 --> 02:06:19,836
Mohammad is its Messenger.

1100
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:38,086
Allah is great!

1101
02:07:50,381 --> 02:07:51,459
Archers!

1102
02:07:51,714 --> 02:07:52,911
Ahead!

1103
02:07:59,130 --> 02:08:00,209
Archers!

1104
02:08:05,714 --> 02:08:07,088
Retain the shooting...

1105
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:24,126
Draw!

1106
02:08:36,629 --> 02:08:37,328
Draw!

1107
02:08:53,295 --> 02:08:53,959
Draw!

1108
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:01,333
Behind!

1109
02:09:20,795 --> 02:09:22,252
They gather.

1110
02:09:22,503 --> 02:09:24,292
Ahead!

1111
02:09:29,628 --> 02:09:30,540
Behind!

1112
02:09:31,753 --> 02:09:34,076
You with the attack prepare!

1113
02:10:00,877 --> 02:10:02,074
Attack!

1114
02:10:51,292 --> 02:10:53,780
Omayya! With us two!

1115
02:11:04,791 --> 02:11:06,782
Omayya! - Bilal!

1116
02:11:36,041 --> 02:11:37,368
Allah is great!

1117
02:11:52,457 --> 02:11:53,831
Victory!

1118
02:12:24,747 --> 02:12:27,745
Allah is great!

1119
02:12:53,455 --> 02:12:56,618
The Prophet refuses to
attach the prisoners.

1120
02:12:57,121 --> 02:12:59,491
A their place, they would have killed us.

1121
02:12:59,746 --> 02:13:02,317
We will comply with the
rules of the Prophet.

1122
02:13:02,580 --> 02:13:06,443
Do not trail them not attached.
Divide your food with them.

1123
02:13:08,538 --> 02:13:10,991
That those which can read and write,

1124
02:13:11,246 --> 02:13:14,907
teach with ten Muslims, in
exchange of their freedom.

1125
02:13:52,828 --> 02:13:54,949
Why me tracking one?

1126
02:13:56,870 --> 02:13:58,446
Why?

1127
02:13:58,703 --> 02:14:01,073
They hold me for person in charge.

1128
02:14:01,244 --> 02:14:04,906
Why was I to die with them in Badr?

1129
02:14:05,536 --> 02:14:09,281
I did not save my skin, but
the goods of Koraichians.

1130
02:14:09,453 --> 02:14:15,117
Enough! Enough! Let us go away!
And enough of lamentations!

1131
02:14:17,077 --> 02:14:19,696
I require that one points
out my father to me?

1132
02:14:20,244 --> 02:14:23,195
My brother? My uncle?

1133
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:29,275
Must one point out my father,
my brother and my uncle to me?

1134
02:14:34,118 --> 02:14:36,074
Mohammad!

1135
02:14:38,785 --> 02:14:40,408
Ali!

1136
02:14:46,868 --> 02:14:48,444
Hamza!

1137
02:14:49,951 --> 02:14:51,361
Hamza!

1138
02:15:03,701 --> 02:15:05,857
With my nails, Hamza.

1139
02:15:07,742 --> 02:15:10,740
With my nails, trenching of throats.

1140
02:15:11,242 --> 02:15:13,233
I will shred you!

1141
02:15:14,326 --> 02:15:16,032
Hamza...

1142
02:15:16,450 --> 02:15:18,157
Hamza!

1143
02:15:20,034 --> 02:15:23,032
I will drive out you, hunter of lions!

1144
02:15:24,117 --> 02:15:26,154
And when you die...

1145
02:15:27,325 --> 02:15:30,240
...I will cut up you,

1146
02:15:30,783 --> 02:15:33,485
assassin of my father...

1147
02:15:34,325 --> 02:15:36,564
I will cut up you!

1148
02:15:37,492 --> 02:15:39,648
Assassin of my brother...

1149
02:15:40,075 --> 02:15:42,065
I will cut up you!

1150
02:15:42,366 --> 02:15:44,523
Assassin of my uncle...

1151
02:15:44,700 --> 02:15:47,153
And when you die...

1152
02:15:47,450 --> 02:15:51,029
...I will drink your blood.

1153
02:15:51,199 --> 02:15:56,401
Cease these complaints,
Hind, we do not have time.

1154
02:15:57,199 --> 02:16:00,280
This time, we will call upon our allies.

1155
02:16:00,491 --> 02:16:03,987
We will prepare in Mohammad
an invincible army.

1156
02:16:11,657 --> 02:16:13,778
Hamza...

1157
02:18:34,486 --> 02:18:39,688
Are this well Medina? Where
are its inhabitants?

1158
02:18:40,528 --> 02:18:44,356
No matter who could be
useful himself at will.

1159
02:18:44,652 --> 02:18:47,058
Are this them new religion?

1160
02:18:47,402 --> 02:18:49,192
Person does not supervise her shop.

1161
02:18:49,361 --> 02:18:51,931
Allah takes care on them.

1162
02:18:52,902 --> 02:18:54,478
From which you come?

1163
02:18:54,735 --> 02:18:55,932
Of Yemen.

1164
02:18:56,277 --> 02:18:59,607
Is you passed by Mecca?
- It was on my road.

1165
02:19:00,235 --> 02:19:03,316
Are you stopped to there? - Yes.

1166
02:19:04,610 --> 02:19:07,099
Time that my camels rest.

1167
02:19:07,527 --> 02:19:11,769
The camels rest there
better than elsewhere.

1168
02:19:11,943 --> 02:19:13,602
Of the news of the desert?

1169
02:19:14,777 --> 02:19:16,399
They are not good.

1170
02:19:16,568 --> 02:19:18,310
They gather.

1171
02:19:18,860 --> 02:19:22,805
Young whole being able to carry
a sword moves towards Mecca.

1172
02:19:22,985 --> 02:19:25,224
Our force resides here.

1173
02:19:25,401 --> 02:19:27,024
Do not underestimate them.

1174
02:19:27,234 --> 02:19:29,272
They gather their courage.

1175
02:19:30,443 --> 02:19:33,725
Mecca one beats the drum
in all the hearths.

1176
02:20:52,857 --> 02:20:56,637
Khalid did not come. - Does not worry you.

1177
02:20:56,815 --> 02:21:00,311
It will be soon the best rider.

1178
02:21:08,606 --> 02:21:09,933
Continue!

1179
02:21:26,064 --> 02:21:28,434
He is an Abyssinian slave.

1180
02:21:28,606 --> 02:21:33,263
Named Al Wahshi, the savage,
because of his cruelty...

1181
02:22:53,853 --> 02:22:56,093
I will liberate you,

1182
02:22:56,686 --> 02:22:59,092
I will give you your silver weight,

1183
02:22:59,436 --> 02:23:03,430
and will dress you in silk for
one launched like this one.

1184
02:23:31,394 --> 02:23:35,434
Here they are finally. We
will know their number.

1185
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:53,933
A large army... 3000
men, hundreds of riders.

1186
02:23:54,101 --> 02:23:58,012
Beat we them in Badr.
- It was one year ago.

1187
02:23:58,226 --> 02:24:00,975
They are there to be avenged for Badr.

1188
02:24:01,184 --> 02:24:03,305
Seek your sabres.

1189
02:24:34,308 --> 02:24:36,465
Blood calls blood!

1190
02:24:36,642 --> 02:24:39,308
O Banu Abd Eddar!

1191
02:24:39,558 --> 02:24:43,883
O defenders of the hearths!
We strike with our sabres!

1192
02:24:46,766 --> 02:24:49,337
Us, girls of Tariq,

1193
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:51,306
We walk on the cushions,

1194
02:24:51,475 --> 02:24:52,967
Whereas the house chokes,

1195
02:24:53,516 --> 02:24:55,139
and the musk are everywhere,

1196
02:24:55,641 --> 02:24:57,596
If you accept, we will embrace.

1197
02:24:57,808 --> 02:24:59,882
And will spread out the cushions.

1198
02:25:00,141 --> 02:25:02,511
If you flee, we will separate.

1199
02:25:02,766 --> 02:25:04,840
A final separation!

1200
02:25:26,515 --> 02:25:28,920
Here is Hamza. You see it?

1201
02:25:37,140 --> 02:25:38,929
It will make your fortune.

1202
02:25:46,973 --> 02:25:48,596
Obayda...

1203
02:25:50,723 --> 02:25:52,132
Riders, over there...

1204
02:25:52,556 --> 02:25:56,384
Their position worries me.
- Khalid Ibn Al Walid directs them.

1205
02:25:56,806 --> 02:25:58,429
Khalid.

1206
02:25:59,431 --> 02:26:01,919
This boy always interested me.

1207
02:26:03,264 --> 02:26:04,721
Hamza.

1208
02:26:07,722 --> 02:26:14,217
- The Prophet asks whether you see them.
- Yes, I am unaware of what they weave.

1209
02:26:14,472 --> 02:26:15,751
You in do not make.

1210
02:26:15,930 --> 02:26:19,343
The Prophet placed our 50
better archers on the mountain,

1211
02:26:19,597 --> 02:26:21,173
and he say to them:

1212
02:26:21,430 --> 02:26:22,923
"Protect our backs,

1213
02:26:23,097 --> 02:26:25,763
if we are killed, do not come to our help

1214
02:26:25,930 --> 02:26:28,928
and if we make a catch, do not come."

1215
02:26:34,846 --> 02:26:36,387
Zayd,

1216
02:26:36,888 --> 02:26:39,555
say to the Prophet that we are ready.

1217
02:26:44,554 --> 02:26:47,043
Glory with Houbal!

1218
02:26:47,679 --> 02:26:49,551
Glory with Houbal!

1219
02:26:58,929 --> 02:27:00,836
That you think Abut it, Hamza?

1220
02:27:01,179 --> 02:27:03,253
They are more numerous than us,

1221
02:27:03,429 --> 02:27:07,090
But we are stronger with the faith.

1222
02:27:07,262 --> 02:27:09,300
Let us see we them, and they see us.

1223
02:27:10,970 --> 02:27:14,004
What faces me does not frighten me.

1224
02:27:16,095 --> 02:27:20,420
When the Prophet orders it to us,
we will throw ourselves on them.

1225
02:27:48,844 --> 02:27:50,799
Archers!

1226
02:27:51,219 --> 02:27:53,091
Prepare your weapons!

1227
02:27:54,511 --> 02:27:56,501
Advance...

1228
02:27:58,636 --> 02:28:00,009
The attack!

1229
02:28:04,385 --> 02:28:06,506
Archers, retain the shooting...

1230
02:28:07,469 --> 02:28:08,381
Draw!

1231
02:30:08,007 --> 02:30:09,499
Hamza died as a martyr!

1232
02:30:09,757 --> 02:30:11,166
Will avenge we it!

1233
02:30:19,923 --> 02:30:22,328
Turn over to your stations!

1234
02:30:28,631 --> 02:30:33,087
Remain in place! Turn
over to your stations!

1235
02:30:33,256 --> 02:30:35,412
Remain in place, loose

1236
02:30:48,630 --> 02:30:50,123
Koraichians move back...

1237
02:30:50,380 --> 02:30:54,374
Their flag falls. Victoire!
- Useless to remain here.

1238
02:30:54,547 --> 02:30:56,502
With the spoils! - Remain at your stations!

1239
02:30:57,338 --> 02:30:59,495
Do not infringe the orders!

1240
02:31:00,130 --> 02:31:02,583
You endanger the right wing of the army!

1241
02:31:04,255 --> 02:31:05,961
We lost the battle.

1242
02:31:06,213 --> 02:31:08,287
The heart of our army is broken.

1243
02:31:15,255 --> 02:31:16,628
Step yet...

1244
02:32:06,545 --> 02:32:08,831
Attack with force!

1245
02:32:21,878 --> 02:32:23,702
Break their unit!

1246
02:33:04,751 --> 02:33:07,998
Where is the Prophet?
- He is said that he died.

1247
02:33:08,501 --> 02:33:10,657
If the Messenger of Allah perished,

1248
02:33:10,834 --> 02:33:13,536
you until death for his cause beat!

1249
02:33:13,793 --> 02:33:15,499
The Messenger of Allah did not die!

1250
02:33:15,709 --> 02:33:17,368
He fight!

1251
02:33:41,500 --> 02:33:43,656
The Prophet is wounded!

1252
02:33:43,833 --> 02:33:45,540
Behind!

1253
02:33:45,750 --> 02:33:47,622
Move back towards the mountain!

1254
02:34:48,873 --> 02:34:50,780
This victory east holds, Khalid.

1255
02:34:50,956 --> 02:34:52,828
It are always over there.

1256
02:34:53,331 --> 02:34:55,238
But we avenged Badr.

1257
02:34:55,540 --> 02:34:59,035
Step before we finished some
with him and his religion.

1258
02:34:59,289 --> 02:35:02,951
If we approach him, they will defend.

1259
02:35:03,289 --> 02:35:04,747
It is too risky.

1260
02:35:07,622 --> 02:35:10,953
Mohammad, you hear me?

1261
02:35:11,539 --> 02:35:15,485
The war has tops and bottoms.

1262
02:35:16,247 --> 02:35:19,328
The days are followed and do not resemble.

1263
02:35:19,789 --> 02:35:23,320
Days ago with and of the days without.

1264
02:35:23,955 --> 02:35:25,069
Glory With Houbal!

1265
02:35:26,039 --> 02:35:28,076
The Prophet known as:

1266
02:35:28,289 --> 02:35:30,777
"Allah is the Almighty.

1267
02:35:30,955 --> 02:35:34,865
Our deaths are with the
paradise and yours in hell."

1268
02:35:35,663 --> 02:35:38,945
We have dignity, not you!

1269
02:35:39,413 --> 02:35:42,660
Allah is our Lord and not yours.

1270
02:36:19,745 --> 02:36:21,404
Hamza...

1271
02:36:28,162 --> 02:36:29,785
Hamza...

1272
02:36:30,453 --> 02:36:32,278
You hear me?

1273
02:36:32,453 --> 02:36:34,195
He is me, Hind.

1274
02:36:34,578 --> 02:36:36,485
The girl of Otba.

1275
02:36:38,286 --> 02:36:40,988
You remember your victims?

1276
02:36:41,161 --> 02:36:42,737
My father...

1277
02:36:42,911 --> 02:36:44,736
My brother...

1278
02:36:44,911 --> 02:36:46,285
My uncle...

1279
02:36:48,953 --> 02:36:51,358
Your death is enough for me it?

1280
02:36:57,202 --> 02:36:59,608
Your death is not enough for me.

1281
02:37:00,661 --> 02:37:02,367
Wahshi!

1282
02:37:02,536 --> 02:37:04,277
Open it!

1283
02:37:04,536 --> 02:37:07,487
Open it! I want his liver.

1284
02:37:25,577 --> 02:37:29,487
They lost the battle, flung the swords,

1285
02:37:29,743 --> 02:37:31,864
and now, they handle the pickaxe.

1286
02:37:33,576 --> 02:37:35,697
Imbeciles!

1287
02:37:36,743 --> 02:37:38,864
They go against logic.

1288
02:37:39,493 --> 02:37:42,526
They are happy of what arrived to them.

1289
02:37:44,076 --> 02:37:46,860
They think that Allah the met of the test.

1290
02:37:47,826 --> 02:37:52,069
They fight for the cause of Allah.

1291
02:37:52,742 --> 02:37:56,570
They want Mecca. - And they will have it.

1292
02:37:56,742 --> 02:37:59,610
When the hens have teeth.

1293
02:37:59,784 --> 02:38:02,865
Do not underestimate
them, Mecca is for them,

1294
02:38:03,617 --> 02:38:05,110
more than one fatherland.

1295
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:10,105
It is the ground of the revelation.

1296
02:38:11,409 --> 02:38:14,075
They go there this year as pilgrims.

1297
02:38:15,617 --> 02:38:16,398
How?

1298
02:38:16,950 --> 02:38:18,608
Without weapons.

1299
02:38:18,950 --> 02:38:20,775
Without weapons?

1300
02:38:21,783 --> 02:38:24,188
Abu Sofyan will complete
them in the desert.

1301
02:38:26,408 --> 02:38:29,939
They think that their faith
as a Allah will save them.

1302
02:38:34,366 --> 02:38:36,689
But I agree with you.

1303
02:38:39,949 --> 02:38:41,774
Perhaps will complete them.

1304
02:40:27,904 --> 02:40:30,606
The Prophet known as:

1305
02:40:31,071 --> 02:40:33,903
"The actions are according to intentions."

1306
02:41:33,486 --> 02:41:35,109
Remain in your places!

1307
02:41:35,361 --> 02:41:37,481
They want to cause you!

1308
02:41:38,027 --> 02:41:39,899
Do not move!

1309
02:42:24,484 --> 02:42:26,688
That peace is with you.

1310
02:43:46,565 --> 02:43:48,223
With the oath!

1311
02:43:48,815 --> 02:43:50,438
The Prophet known as:

1312
02:43:50,940 --> 02:43:54,352
"That which loves Allah
lends oath under the tree."

1313
02:43:59,981 --> 02:44:02,434
"In the name of Allah, Most
Gracious, Most Merciful."

1314
02:44:03,314 --> 02:44:05,708
"Certainly Allah was well
pleased with the believers

1315
02:44:05,709 --> 02:44:08,102
when they swore allegiance
to you under the tree,

1316
02:44:08,856 --> 02:44:10,349
and it knew what was in their hearts,

1317
02:44:10,606 --> 02:44:13,769
and it sent down tranquillity to them,

1318
02:44:13,939 --> 02:44:17,435
and rewarded them with a near victory."

1319
02:44:17,606 --> 02:44:20,355
Allah and his Messenger said the truth.

1320
02:44:50,271 --> 02:44:53,020
Another negotiator arrived.

1321
02:44:53,188 --> 02:44:55,937
Suhayl Ibn Amr.

1322
02:44:56,105 --> 02:44:58,889
Perhaps they want a conciliation.

1323
02:45:06,813 --> 02:45:08,471
Mohammad.

1324
02:45:09,354 --> 02:45:14,225
You saw yourself proposing the conditions
of a truce between you and Mecca.

1325
02:45:14,896 --> 02:45:17,052
You gave your agreement?

1326
02:45:27,395 --> 02:45:29,137
What it is?

1327
02:45:30,145 --> 02:45:32,349
"In the name of Allah, Most
Gracious, Most Merciful."

1328
02:45:32,978 --> 02:45:34,886
I do not know it.

1329
02:45:35,645 --> 02:45:38,050
Write in the name of Allah.

1330
02:45:39,228 --> 02:45:43,969
"Here what Mohammad was appropriate,
the Messenger of Allah."

1331
02:45:46,270 --> 02:45:48,675
If I had believed that you
were the Messenger of Allah,

1332
02:45:48,853 --> 02:45:51,685
I would not have fought you.

1333
02:45:52,519 --> 02:45:54,178
Write rather:

1334
02:45:55,478 --> 02:46:00,016
Here what Mohammad was
appropriate, son of Abdallah

1335
02:46:00,186 --> 02:46:02,342
with Suhayl, wire of Amr.

1336
02:46:03,936 --> 02:46:06,259
Are not this more correct?

1337
02:46:07,394 --> 02:46:09,017
It is better.

1338
02:46:15,185 --> 02:46:18,681
"Mohammad and its partisans
leave this year Mecca,

1339
02:46:18,935 --> 02:46:20,843
and return on their premises."

1340
02:46:21,185 --> 02:46:22,678
Mecca, it is on our premises.

1341
02:46:24,560 --> 02:46:27,890
"Next year, we will leave Mecca,

1342
02:46:28,227 --> 02:46:31,260
you will enter there for three days,

1343
02:46:32,060 --> 02:46:34,346
The swords will be in their sleeves."

1344
02:46:36,268 --> 02:46:41,388
If you accept, we will grant
a ten years to you truce.

1345
02:46:42,226 --> 02:46:45,224
The people will be in safety.

1346
02:46:46,768 --> 02:46:51,306
You will not attack us night
and will not betray us.

1347
02:46:52,309 --> 02:46:53,968
Us either.

1348
02:46:55,559 --> 02:46:59,802
That which will want to follow
Mohammad, will follow him.

1349
02:47:01,684 --> 02:47:06,425
And which will want to follow
Koraichians, will do it.

1350
02:47:08,684 --> 02:47:10,639
If you refuse,

1351
02:47:11,225 --> 02:47:15,301
or if you wound one among
us or of our allies,

1352
02:47:16,475 --> 02:47:18,631
The truce will end.

1353
02:47:30,475 --> 02:47:32,465
Ten years.

1354
02:47:34,141 --> 02:47:36,712
Ten years of peace.

1355
02:47:37,683 --> 02:47:40,385
We need this time.

1356
02:47:40,808 --> 02:47:43,806
We will use this time.

1357
02:48:01,099 --> 02:48:05,839
They are the letters of the Prophet to
the kings, calling them with Islam.

1358
02:48:07,557 --> 02:48:09,761
To Heraclius, emperor of the Romans.

1359
02:48:10,974 --> 02:48:12,964
To Khosro, emperor of Perse.

1360
02:48:14,182 --> 02:48:16,635
To Cyrus, patriarch of Alexandria.

1361
02:48:18,307 --> 02:48:20,630
On the way. That Allah blesses you!

1362
02:48:50,639 --> 02:48:53,672
One do not have the faith,

1363
02:48:53,972 --> 02:48:57,717
that if one wishes for his next
what one wishes for oneself.

1364
02:48:57,889 --> 02:49:00,922
That which falls asleep the full belly,

1365
02:49:01,097 --> 02:49:03,004
whereas its neighbor is hungry,

1366
02:49:03,180 --> 02:49:05,088
are not Muslim.

1367
02:49:06,430 --> 02:49:10,922
Islam releases us from the fanaticism
and the heat of ignorance.

1368
02:49:12,138 --> 02:49:14,342
Allah the Almighty said:

1369
02:49:14,888 --> 02:49:16,547
"O humans!

1370
02:49:16,722 --> 02:49:20,667
We created you starting from
a male and of a female.

1371
02:49:20,846 --> 02:49:23,631
You knew each other.

1372
02:49:24,888 --> 02:49:27,839
The noblest among you for
Allah is most pious."

1373
02:49:28,013 --> 02:49:29,210
Allah, the Great, said the truth.

1374
02:49:31,263 --> 02:49:34,877
"Thy Lord hath decreed that
you worship none but it,

1375
02:49:35,263 --> 02:49:37,716
and that you be kind to parents..."

1376
02:49:39,096 --> 02:49:40,375
Yes.

1377
02:49:40,846 --> 02:49:43,050
The faith is thus.

1378
02:49:43,971 --> 02:49:45,843
Parents...

1379
02:49:46,137 --> 02:49:48,211
"... say not to them a word
of contempt, nor repel them,

1380
02:49:48,387 --> 02:49:51,172
but speak to them generous words.

1381
02:49:51,471 --> 02:49:54,717
And, out of kindness, lower
to them the wing of humility,

1382
02:49:54,929 --> 02:49:59,136
and say: 'My Lord! Bestow on them thy mercy
even as they cherished me in childhood'."

1383
02:50:00,637 --> 02:50:03,007
Allah the Almighty said:

1384
02:50:03,220 --> 02:50:07,545
"Say: O People! Here that the
truth came from your Lord.

1385
02:50:07,720 --> 02:50:11,666
That which takes the right way
takes it only for its own good.

1386
02:50:11,845 --> 02:50:15,625
That which takes that of the wander
mislays only with its only detriment.

1387
02:50:15,803 --> 02:50:21,800
That which seeks the ploughing of the
ultimate life, we let us give it to him,

1388
02:50:22,303 --> 02:50:26,592
and that which seeks the ploughing of the
low world, we let us grant it to him,

1389
02:50:26,761 --> 02:50:30,257
and it do not have in the
ultimate life any share."

1390
02:50:30,511 --> 02:50:35,583
And Allah said: "Allah does not
change the state of people,

1391
02:50:36,094 --> 02:50:39,294
that if it changes what
there is in itself."

1392
02:50:41,719 --> 02:50:44,503
"Restore the deposit with its beneficiary,

1393
02:50:44,719 --> 02:50:47,124
betrayed not that which betrayed you."

1394
02:50:48,094 --> 02:50:51,294
The Messenger of Allah, that
safety is on him, known as:

1395
02:50:52,510 --> 02:50:57,084
"You all are of the guards and
persons in charge for your subjects.

1396
02:50:58,802 --> 02:51:00,508
The Imam is a guard,

1397
02:51:00,677 --> 02:51:04,457
and person in charge for his subjects.

1398
02:51:04,718 --> 02:51:07,337
And the man are a guard of his family,

1399
02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:10,295
and he are the person in
charge for his subjects.

1400
02:51:11,260 --> 02:51:14,590
And the woman are guardian
in the house of her husband

1401
02:51:14,843 --> 02:51:17,510
and she is responsible for his subjects.

1402
02:51:18,760 --> 02:51:21,876
The servant is a guard of
the goods of his master

1403
02:51:22,551 --> 02:51:25,086
and it are responsible for its subjects.

1404
02:51:25,593 --> 02:51:31,044
You all are of the guards and all
persons in charge for your subjects."

1405
02:52:13,966 --> 02:52:16,881
Are you to take me along still there?

1406
02:52:17,091 --> 02:52:20,006
I come to ask you to accept me.

1407
02:52:38,715 --> 02:52:41,204
I attest that there is of Allah only God,

1408
02:52:42,007 --> 02:52:45,005
and Mohammad is its Messenger.

1409
02:52:47,882 --> 02:52:51,294
Allah will forgive me it to
have fought you, Mohammad?

1410
02:52:51,673 --> 02:52:55,252
You in do not make, Khalid,
Islam cancels what precedes it.

1411
02:53:02,256 --> 02:53:04,875
Allah granted prosperity to you.

1412
02:53:05,048 --> 02:53:08,378
I find that this plait
hurts you at the coasts,

1413
02:53:08,590 --> 02:53:10,165
You accept my cape?

1414
02:53:11,798 --> 02:53:16,123
The Prophet recommends asceticism.
The richness is not eternal.

1415
02:53:17,506 --> 02:53:20,374
He do not have that the
cape which it has on him.

1416
02:53:22,047 --> 02:53:25,579
I am sorry to have come thus avoided.

1417
02:53:29,047 --> 02:53:31,203
If the Messenger allows it to me,

1418
02:53:31,422 --> 02:53:34,953
I give them to him, in order to
distribute them to the poor.

1419
02:53:40,172 --> 02:53:41,748
Khalid,

1420
02:53:42,963 --> 02:53:47,420
Your sabre was hardest on the Muslims.

1421
02:53:47,922 --> 02:53:50,078
You will be now

1422
02:53:50,463 --> 02:53:52,584
the sabres of Allah.

1423
02:53:55,338 --> 02:53:57,578
I will be it with the assistance of Allah.

1424
02:54:13,754 --> 02:54:16,421
Whole is easy for Allah.

1425
02:54:18,087 --> 02:54:21,251
As it can make death, the life,

1426
02:54:22,046 --> 02:54:25,493
it can make of a defeat, a victory.

1427
02:54:26,045 --> 02:54:27,752
Two years ago,

1428
02:54:28,462 --> 02:54:32,290
we regarded the truce of
Hudaybya as a defeat.

1429
02:54:32,462 --> 02:54:34,120
But today,

1430
02:54:34,879 --> 02:54:39,500
we accumulate the victories
in the heart of the men.

1431
02:54:44,253 --> 02:54:45,995
What it is?

1432
02:55:12,919 --> 02:55:14,661
Abu Sofyan!

1433
02:55:43,543 --> 02:55:45,285
Where is Mohammad, that I speak to him?

1434
02:55:45,460 --> 02:55:47,616
The Prophet is in the mosque.

1435
02:56:02,501 --> 02:56:06,743
Mohammad, your people did not violate
your engagement with Hudaybya.

1436
02:56:06,917 --> 02:56:10,081
And I came to repair the
fault of the nomads.

1437
02:56:12,584 --> 02:56:15,452
Mohammad, why you turn me the back?

1438
02:56:15,959 --> 02:56:16,788
Wait.

1439
02:56:17,417 --> 02:56:19,491
Mohammad, you in does not go...

1440
02:56:19,750 --> 02:56:23,958
They are the wandering gangsters
who violated the truce!

1441
02:56:24,334 --> 02:56:26,538
Why us make take the responsibility?

1442
02:56:26,708 --> 02:56:31,081
It was the night! How
you could have seen us?

1443
02:56:32,500 --> 02:56:35,332
Bara! I am in your city.

1444
02:56:39,166 --> 02:56:42,117
Hudayfa, we are parents!

1445
02:56:42,541 --> 02:56:44,579
Somebody must listen to me!

1446
02:56:47,708 --> 02:56:51,915
Abu Bakr, Omar, Ali...
Nobody wants to approach me?

1447
02:56:52,833 --> 02:56:56,529
I am the chief of Mecca! I am Mecca!

1448
02:56:56,708 --> 02:57:00,155
I am Abu Sofyan! How can one scorn me thus?

1449
02:57:00,332 --> 02:57:04,278
Because you hold neither
promises nor engagements.

1450
02:57:07,624 --> 02:57:09,661
Abu Sofyan beseeches it pity?

1451
02:57:09,915 --> 02:57:11,906
And you failed...

1452
02:57:12,082 --> 02:57:15,661
Because you are always same
the, arrogant one and heading.

1453
02:57:16,415 --> 02:57:18,571
You refuse to adore single Allah.

1454
02:57:19,582 --> 02:57:22,663
I did not know that you had
changed at this point.

1455
02:57:22,998 --> 02:57:26,944
Yes, but of the unbelief in the faith.

1456
02:57:29,415 --> 02:57:30,991
That to say?

1457
02:57:32,081 --> 02:57:33,409
I am overcome...

1458
02:57:33,581 --> 02:57:36,912
I was overcome by the shepherd of Meccaâ€¦

1459
02:57:37,748 --> 02:57:41,611
...or by his religion,
which began with a man,

1460
02:57:41,790 --> 02:57:44,325
two boys and a woman.

1461
02:57:44,914 --> 02:57:48,245
This religion which was
established in four hearts,

1462
02:57:48,414 --> 02:57:51,531
you do not believe that it is a
hand which takes care on it?

1463
02:57:51,706 --> 02:57:56,114
Why it did not choose a powerful
man of the two villages?

1464
02:57:56,372 --> 02:58:00,829
Return quickly in Mecca,
any man here you in wants.

1465
02:58:01,081 --> 02:58:05,987
Say them that their gods died.
Useless to fight Allah.

1466
02:58:40,413 --> 02:58:42,818
The tribes continue to arrive.

1467
02:58:42,996 --> 02:58:45,663
We will be ten thousand before the night.

1468
02:59:04,995 --> 02:59:07,235
We can finally fight them.

1469
02:59:07,412 --> 02:59:10,161
We will strengthen the houses
and will block the exits.

1470
02:59:14,037 --> 02:59:16,442
It is useless.

1471
02:59:16,620 --> 02:59:19,369
They are ten thousand today.

1472
02:59:19,662 --> 02:59:21,984
You are only one loose!

1473
02:59:22,286 --> 02:59:24,822
- Rather to die... - Return to the house.

1474
02:59:25,161 --> 02:59:29,237
Coward! Are you the chief of Mecca?

1475
02:59:29,536 --> 02:59:30,946
Are looked at.

1476
02:59:31,120 --> 02:59:32,991
You are broken.

1477
02:59:33,161 --> 02:59:36,443
My father and my brother
died so that you capitulate?

1478
02:59:36,619 --> 02:59:38,326
You are in the two houses.

1479
02:59:38,494 --> 02:59:42,950
You are stupid. We cannot fight them.

1480
02:59:43,869 --> 02:59:45,860
They take again Mecca.

1481
02:59:58,869 --> 03:00:01,618
We will camp this night here.

1482
03:00:04,868 --> 03:00:06,575
Mecca...

1483
03:00:07,702 --> 03:00:10,368
...I see it even through these mountains.

1484
03:00:22,035 --> 03:00:24,570
I have the impression that
the sky was closed again,

1485
03:00:24,743 --> 03:00:27,492
and that the stars dispersed on the ground.

1486
03:00:29,118 --> 03:00:30,741
It is beautiful.

1487
03:00:32,451 --> 03:00:35,449
It is strange... I feel their bread.

1488
03:00:36,534 --> 03:00:39,318
Perhaps They did not come for the war.

1489
03:00:39,659 --> 03:00:41,945
It is what I hope for.

1490
03:00:42,201 --> 03:00:46,443
I do not think that they want
blood on their thresholds.

1491
03:00:46,617 --> 03:00:48,738
Drove out we them of Mecca,

1492
03:00:48,909 --> 03:00:52,109
but Mecca are in their heart.

1493
03:00:52,534 --> 03:00:55,022
I can still negotiate with them.

1494
03:01:26,533 --> 03:01:27,646
Lead me to him.

1495
03:01:29,199 --> 03:01:31,190
You came to deliver Mecca to us?

1496
03:01:40,116 --> 03:01:42,153
You me offers not of bread?

1497
03:01:43,865 --> 03:01:44,813
I know.

1498
03:01:45,949 --> 03:01:47,856
You want to perhaps kill me.

1499
03:02:25,781 --> 03:02:28,067
Say what you came to say to us.

1500
03:02:30,239 --> 03:02:34,612
I saw fires of your camping
and the men around.

1501
03:02:36,864 --> 03:02:40,360
I saw the power of which
you nourished your men.

1502
03:02:45,030 --> 03:02:47,186
If you agree on...

1503
03:02:47,364 --> 03:02:49,437
You installations still your conditions?

1504
03:02:49,613 --> 03:02:51,438
Abu Sofyan,

1505
03:02:51,655 --> 03:02:55,696
when your heart with the
religion of Mohammad opens?

1506
03:03:00,030 --> 03:03:02,944
I still have doubts.

1507
03:03:03,155 --> 03:03:05,275
If we cut you the head, you
would not have any any more.

1508
03:03:05,446 --> 03:03:06,820
Not, Khalid.

1509
03:03:07,196 --> 03:03:08,819
Constraint no in religion.

1510
03:03:10,738 --> 03:03:14,317
Some need years, others of moments.

1511
03:03:16,696 --> 03:03:18,900
Allah guides who it wants.

1512
03:03:24,654 --> 03:03:26,858
You, the black slave,

1513
03:03:27,279 --> 03:03:29,483
you are a good example.

1514
03:03:31,987 --> 03:03:34,108
I am only what Allah gave me.

1515
03:03:37,737 --> 03:03:38,850
Yes.

1516
03:03:40,904 --> 03:03:43,108
If my gods were good,

1517
03:03:45,945 --> 03:03:48,101
they would not have given up me.

1518
03:03:52,528 --> 03:03:54,815
I say sincerely,

1519
03:03:57,486 --> 03:03:59,975
without perjury and constraint:

1520
03:04:02,945 --> 03:04:05,777
I attest that there is of God only Allah...

1521
03:04:08,778 --> 03:04:11,562
...and that you are the Messenger of Allah.

1522
03:04:16,694 --> 03:04:19,183
Now, let leave to me.

1523
03:04:20,486 --> 03:04:25,226
Return on your premise! The army of
the Muslims between three sides.

1524
03:04:33,277 --> 03:04:36,607
The army of the Muslims between
in Mecca on the three sides.

1525
03:04:54,401 --> 03:04:59,603
Allah is great! Allah is great!

1526
03:05:03,443 --> 03:05:06,441
It have there of Allah only God.

1527
03:05:08,984 --> 03:05:13,476
Allah is great! Allah is great!

1528
03:05:16,109 --> 03:05:18,514
Thanks to Allah.

1529
03:05:18,692 --> 03:05:25,056
Allah is the Almighty and
its grace is abundant.

1530
03:05:25,234 --> 03:05:26,975
Glory with Allah.

1531
03:05:27,192 --> 03:05:30,522
Of the daybreak in the twilight.

1532
03:05:30,692 --> 03:05:34,271
It have there of Allah only God.

1533
03:05:36,150 --> 03:05:39,432
His word was held. He gave
the victory to its men,

1534
03:05:39,608 --> 03:05:45,189
with his dearer warriors and he
overcame the clans all alone.

1535
03:05:45,358 --> 03:05:49,814
He have there of Allah only God,

1536
03:05:49,983 --> 03:05:54,059
we adore only him,

1537
03:05:54,233 --> 03:05:57,017
and let us devote all our devotion to him,

1538
03:05:57,191 --> 03:06:01,315
against the liking of the inaccurate ones.

1539
03:09:04,435 --> 03:09:07,184
Do not use of violence in Mecca.

1540
03:09:07,352 --> 03:09:10,136
Be lenient towards its inhabitants,

1541
03:09:10,310 --> 03:09:13,391
do not maltreat anybody.

1542
03:09:13,810 --> 03:09:16,725
Behind the doors, you are in safety.

1543
03:09:16,977 --> 03:09:21,017
In the house of Abu Sofyan,
you are in safety.

1544
03:09:21,185 --> 03:09:25,048
In the mosque, you are in safety.

1545
03:09:35,976 --> 03:09:37,967
He held his word.

1546
03:09:38,143 --> 03:09:40,761
They did not force a door.

1547
03:09:41,268 --> 03:09:44,964
It take the hearts by storm, not the walls.

1548
03:09:45,684 --> 03:09:47,758
It is that, the victory.

1549
03:09:49,267 --> 03:09:51,175
To see it hurt me.

1550
03:09:52,184 --> 03:09:54,507
We must make an appearance.

1551
03:09:59,600 --> 03:10:01,757
Were us in mislaying?

1552
03:10:02,975 --> 03:10:05,890
Yes, we were in mislaying.

1553
03:10:07,142 --> 03:10:09,677
Our pride trapped us.

1554
03:10:10,267 --> 03:10:13,383
Our gods were worth even less than us.

1555
03:10:14,892 --> 03:10:16,633
Here it is,

1556
03:10:17,183 --> 03:10:19,672
it approach Kaaba.

1557
03:12:24,429 --> 03:12:27,261
"In the name of Allah, Most
Gracious, Most Merciful."

1558
03:12:28,054 --> 03:12:31,799
"And when we assigned to Abraham
the place of the House, saying:

1559
03:12:31,971 --> 03:12:34,720
'Do not associate with Me aught,

1560
03:12:34,887 --> 03:12:37,613
and purify my House for those
who make the circuit and

1561
03:12:37,614 --> 03:12:40,338
stand to pray and bow and
prostrate themselves'."

1562
03:12:41,345 --> 03:12:43,253
Allah, the Great, said the truth.

1563
03:12:52,720 --> 03:12:55,173
"... The truth has come,

1564
03:12:56,512 --> 03:12:59,545
and the falsehood has vanished..."

1565
03:14:57,800 --> 03:15:00,751
And the victory of Allah came.

1566
03:15:01,133 --> 03:15:04,913
And Mecca were subjected while
waiting for its right sanction.

1567
03:15:05,591 --> 03:15:07,214
But the said lenient Prophet:

1568
03:15:07,383 --> 03:15:09,788
"Leave, you are free."

1569
03:15:10,966 --> 03:15:15,090
And Mecca adhered to the Islam which
preaches justice and the good

1570
03:15:15,257 --> 03:15:18,954
and prohibit turpitudes, the
atrocities and the injustices.

1571
03:15:19,549 --> 03:15:22,879
And the Prophet felt, after
having achieved his mission,

1572
03:15:23,799 --> 03:15:26,501
that his meeting with Allah was close.

1573
03:15:28,840 --> 03:15:33,047
The day of the great pilgrimage
in the year ten of the Hegira,

1574
03:15:34,423 --> 03:15:36,793
The Prophet went to the Arafat mount,

1575
03:15:37,340 --> 03:15:42,081
and invited the people to listen to the
sermon of the pilgrimage of farewell.

1576
03:15:43,007 --> 03:15:46,170
"O Humans! Listens to me.

1577
03:15:46,423 --> 03:15:51,625
I am unaware of if I will
find you here the next year.

1578
03:15:52,840 --> 03:15:54,581
O Humans!

1579
03:15:54,881 --> 03:16:00,581
Your blood and your goods are crowned
until your meeting with Allah,

1580
03:16:01,464 --> 03:16:05,624
just like this place and
this month are crowned.

1581
03:16:06,006 --> 03:16:09,999
You will meet Allah and it will
question you on your acts,

1582
03:16:10,256 --> 03:16:12,211
and I transmitted the message.

1583
03:16:13,089 --> 03:16:17,414
That which keeps a good returns it
to that which entrusted it to him.

1584
03:16:18,505 --> 03:16:20,745
And any wear are inhibited.

1585
03:16:20,922 --> 03:16:27,120
But you have your capital, do not
oppress and be not oppressed.

1586
03:16:27,963 --> 03:16:31,411
Retain what I say, because
I transmitted my message.

1587
03:16:32,130 --> 03:16:36,917
I left you what will light you
and will always guide you:

1588
03:16:37,755 --> 03:16:40,539
The delivers of Allah and
Sunna of the Prophet.

1589
03:16:41,588 --> 03:16:42,832
O Humans!

1590
03:16:43,421 --> 03:16:45,329
Listen to my message and retain it.

1591
03:16:46,213 --> 03:16:49,910
Learn that a Muslim is the
brother of any other Muslim,

1592
03:16:50,088 --> 03:16:52,576
and that the Muslims are brothers.

1593
03:16:52,754 --> 03:16:57,909
The goods of a brother inviolable
are except yielded full liking.

1594
03:16:58,088 --> 03:17:00,658
Alors do not be unjust towards yourselves.

1595
03:17:01,421 --> 03:17:03,660
My Allah, achieved I my mission?"

1596
03:17:04,504 --> 03:17:07,253
After having guided the prayer
of midday and the afternoon,

1597
03:17:07,962 --> 03:17:11,493
The Prophet recited them the
ultimate revelation of Coran:

1598
03:17:12,045 --> 03:17:14,830
"Today, I completed for you your religion,

1599
03:17:15,337 --> 03:17:17,541
and accomplished on you my grace,

1600
03:17:17,712 --> 03:17:20,414
and I approved you the
Islam like religion."

1601
03:17:21,795 --> 03:17:22,992
Abu Bakr cried.

1602
03:17:24,545 --> 03:17:26,749
And came the painful day.

1603
03:17:27,587 --> 03:17:30,999
The Prophet was 63 years old.

1604
03:17:31,753 --> 03:17:36,327
One Monday of June of
year 13 of the Hegira,

1605
03:17:37,545 --> 03:17:41,040
last of the prophets
chooses to join his Allah.

1606
03:17:41,836 --> 03:17:44,040
And Medina trembled of sorrow.

1607
03:17:44,211 --> 03:17:48,418
Person believed only that which
bless Allah and the angels,

1608
03:17:49,169 --> 03:17:51,788
can be in a tomb.

1609
03:17:52,378 --> 03:17:54,617
But Mohammad had died.

1610
03:17:55,377 --> 03:17:58,873
And here what Abu Bakr says,
in the mosque of the Prophet:

1611
03:17:59,502 --> 03:18:01,043
'O Humans!

1612
03:18:01,211 --> 03:18:05,251
That that which venerates Mohammad
knows that Mohammad died.

1613
03:18:05,419 --> 03:18:09,875
But that that which venerates Allah,
knows that Allah will be always alive. '

1614
03:18:11,544 --> 03:18:16,663
And its saint body were buried
in his mosque with Medina.

1615
03:18:17,627 --> 03:18:21,834
But its heart will remain, as
its message which does not die.

1616
03:18:22,335 --> 03:18:23,993
Allah is great.

1617
03:18:24,210 --> 03:18:30,456
A its light, the partisans of
the Prophet continue to preach,

1618
03:18:30,626 --> 03:18:32,498
to request only Allah,

1619
03:18:32,668 --> 03:18:34,410
and to associate anybody to him.

1620
03:18:34,710 --> 03:18:38,075
And not to take for Allah other than him.

1621
03:18:38,918 --> 03:18:40,410
Allah is great.

1622
03:18:40,584 --> 03:18:44,163
The number of the Muslims increases.

1623
03:18:44,626 --> 03:18:47,908
And the man who was alone
became a community.

1624
03:18:48,084 --> 03:18:52,160
And the community gather all the
people around the word 'Allah'.

1625
03:18:52,501 --> 03:18:56,992
"O Humans! We have created surely
you of a male and a female,

1626
03:18:57,167 --> 03:19:00,829
and made you tribes and families
that you may know each other.

1627
03:19:01,625 --> 03:19:05,370
Verily the most honored of you in the sight
of Allah is the most righteous of you..."

1628
03:19:05,917 --> 03:19:08,619
Allah and its Messenger said the truth.
