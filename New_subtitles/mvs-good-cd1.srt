1
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:26,315
Well first I want to say that there

2
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:27,707
the will not be under any condition

3
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:31,031
be an intervention in Cuba
by Unites States armed forces.

4
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:35,376
This government will do
everything it possibly can

5
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:37,832
and I think it can meet
it's responsibilities

6
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,174
to make sure that there are no
Americans involved in any actions

7
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,690
inside Cuba.

8
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:28,308
Excuse me sir.

9
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:30,183
Do you have change for a dollar?

10
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,439
Thank you sir.

11
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
You're welcome

12
00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:15,313
From our friends on Wall Street.

13
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:16,607
Miami?

14
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,108
Right away.

15
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:32,613
Cardinal is interested.

16
00:04:43,014 --> 00:04:44,414
So the weatherman says

17
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,415
Sunday is the perfect day

18
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,216
for a trip to the beach.

19
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:49,804
I hope you can still dance Edward.

20
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:52,608
In a couple of days we will be doing

21
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:54,903
the cha cha in El Comandante's bedroom.

22
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:56,904
I'll try to remember to bring
my dancing shoes, Richard.

23
00:04:58,702 --> 00:04:59,702
Good morning Ray.

24
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:00,803
Mr. Hayes.

25
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:06,807
Miami.

26
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:07,861
And our Op center off Guatemala.

27
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:12,025
Pack a bathing suit Mr. Brocco.

28
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:13,226
We're going for a swim.

29
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,681
What do you make of
our chances for success?

30
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,458
If we get the support
that we've been promised

31
00:05:21,343 --> 00:05:22,743
I'd say it's fairly certain.

32
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:25,381
But if there are any doubts

33
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:26,723
I can still put out the fire.

34
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:28,724
It's gone beyond that.

35
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,497
Rocking chair is still smiling.

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:35,069

38
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:38,145
Everybody is waiting for the good news.

39
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:40,742
Godspeed!

40
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:43,554
When your back

41
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:44,895

42
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:45,896
We'll go fishing.

43
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:52,394
Yes sir.

44
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:54,898
He's been put on notice.

45
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:57,669
In Cuba,

46
00:05:58,142 --> 00:05:59,842
sometime before dawn,

47
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,520
The invading forces' B-26 bombers

48
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,070
give air cover to men
landing on the beach.

49
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:09,447
As the sun rises

50
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:12,248
there is a surprised attack
from Castro's air force.

51
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,172
The B-26s are shot down.

52
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:20,099
Without air cover, the anti-Castro
forces' ships are attacked.

53
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,700
And the men are cut
off from their supplies.

54
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:25,001
The situation looks dire.

55
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:28,082
Where is the air support!

56
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,883
Where the hell is the Navy.

57
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:36,184
Would you throw something into
this vital point of the battle.

58
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:41,945
Enemy in red trucks
coming from red beach

59
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:45,645

60
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:50,093
Two thousand militia
attacking blue beach

61
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:51,816
from east to west.

62
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:54,799
We need

63
00:06:55,118 --> 00:06:56,818
close air support immediately!

64
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:02,035
Well, I am destroying all my
equipment and communications.

65
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:03,831
I have nothing with which to fight.

66
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:05,229
I'm going to the woods.

67
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:06,706
I cannot wait for you.

68
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:07,799
I'm going to the woods.

69
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:47,948
They knew where to find us.

70
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:56,335
There's a stranger in our house.

71
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:44,387
I love you.

72
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:48,066
People who really love each
other don't have secrets.

73
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:51,909
You are safe here with me.

74

I love you.

People who really love each

You are safe here with me.

81
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:49,216
The president is saying they're going
to break the CIA into a thousand pieces.

82
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:53,467
Somebody on your desk
gave away the store.

83
00:09:55,283 --> 00:09:57,983
Told the Soviets where to
find you at the Bay of Pigs.

84
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:00,559
You've got a problem very close to home.

85
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:06,074
There will be an extensive house
cleaning on your side of the street.

86
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:13,219
Fucking cigarette.

87
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:16,469
Are there any regulars
that can fit me anymore?

88
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:22,711
They didn't get it all.

89
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:25,061
I'm sorry.

90
00:10:25,703 --> 00:10:27,003
Be careful.

91
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,741
Your name is on a must worry list.

92
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:32,916
Right at the very top.

93
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:47,117
You forgot your hat.

94
00:11:10,414 --> 00:11:12,914
Somebody left a package
at my doorstep last night.

95
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:15,667
Have tech wash them right away.

96
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,229
I've been trying to reach you.

97
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,230
Well, I haven't been staying
at the compound. ?????

98
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:31,637
I heard there was a setback.

99
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:35,068
Sometimes the best laid
plans of mice and men.

100
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:38,437
Be very careful.

101
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:41,063
I'll be fine. You worry too much.

102
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,570
Just please be careful.

I don't think this is for me.

You can't take it personally.

134
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:37,608
Getting pissed on is
personal Mr. Russell.

135
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:38,609
So I take it very personal.

136
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:41,581

00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:42,782
We're all in this together.

told anyone before.

00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:07,182
Something you will
need to trust us with.

144
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:13,501
It was the 4th of July, 1925.

145
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:16,633
I was six.

146
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:22,468
I was playing tag with a friend of mine.

147
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:26,379
and I tried to get away from him

148
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:28,651
so I ran up the stairs
into my parents room.

149
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:31,438
And I hid in a closet.

150
00:16:35,372 --> 00:16:36,672
I looked at my father's clothes

151
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,438
and hanging there was
his admirals jacket.

152
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,420
And then I heard a sound.

153
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,021
and I saw my father

154
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:50,485
and I must have made a
noise because he turned

155
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:52,286
and came into the closet
and opened the door.

156
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,440
Have you ever made up a story Edward?

157
00:16:57,253 --> 00:16:59,487
Told your friends something
you knew wasn't true?

158
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:01,961
And you know that if they found out...

159
00:17:02,294 --> 00:17:03,494
they wouldn't like you anymore.

160
00:17:04,748 --> 00:17:06,148
Why?

161
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:07,446
Because you lied to them.

162
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:09,779
You understand?

163
00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:13,793
And he asked me if I knew was trust was.

164
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:17,144
And I said... trust is when
you feel safe with someone.

165
00:17:17,418 --> 00:17:18,818
Like with my friends.

166
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:20,636
Like with you and mother.

167
00:17:20,637 --> 00:17:21,637
And then he said.

168
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:23,638
Don't ever lie.

169
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:26,988
You shouldn't lie to your friends.

170
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:28,989
They won't trust you.

171
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:31,895
And you will have nothing.

172
00:17:35,268 --> 00:17:36,868
And you'll never be safe.

173
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:41,397
He told me to go downstairs
and watch the fireworks.

174
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:44,343
Because they'd started.

175
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:50,499
And then he shut the door.

176
00:17:57,324 --> 00:18:00,624
The sound of the gunshot was very
different from the sound of the fireworks.

177
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:04,025
And even at six years old I new
there was a big big difference.

178
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:09,025
There was a lot of blood.

179
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:09,973
Father?

180
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:14,498
And in his left hand he held a note

181
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:16,081
that was sealed.

182
00:18:18,002 --> 00:18:21,202
I don’t know why, buy I took the
note and I put it in my pocket.

183
00:18:23,797 --> 00:18:24,997
I always said it was an accident.

184
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:29,391
It wasn't and accident.

185
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:30,487
My father killed himself.

00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:49,087
Congratulations Mr.
Wilson. I'm Richard Hayes.

188
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,309
Master of secrets and orders.

189
00:18:55,745 --> 00:18:57,045
What did the note say?

190
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,004
I told you I never read the note.

191
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:01,388
You didn't read the note?

192
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:04,706
No.

193
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,217
My father said your father

194
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,518
was going to be appointed
Secretary of the Navy

195
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:18,503
until his loyalty

196
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,524
was brought under question.

197
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,429
We're not going to have a
problem with your loyalty are we?

198
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:33,362
And yet ...

199
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:34,862
a certain word

200
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:36,463
a glance, a guise,

201
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:39,369
will mirror never show?

202
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:40,989
reflecting not my gaze

203
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,290
but my uncertain question caught

204
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,091
inside a shadow of our shifting eyes.

205
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,700
That really is quite elegant Mr. Wilson

206
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:55,342
Good order. Very precise.

207
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,150
Feeling of the unknown.

208
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:02,553
Fine poetry is the music of mathematics.

209
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,330
Numbers.

210
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:06,358
Singing.

211
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,730
You have to look behind the words

212
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,170
to understand their meaning.

213
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:15,595
Right. Well, good night gentlemen.

214
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:18,333
Mr. Wilson

215
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:22,134
May I see you in my
office for a few words?

216
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:27,468
I am recommending you as editor of
our poetry magazine, The Politicus.

217
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:31,447
I'm honored. Thank you.

218
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,148
I appreciate your faith in me.

219
00:20:33,622 --> 00:20:36,049
Never be ashamed of
your abilities, Edward.

220
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:53,872
Isn't there a picture that used to sit

221
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:56,773
on the mantle there, and there
was a group of soldiers...

222
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:59,711
It's my father's Crimean War regiment.

223
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:00,712
The ?????

224
00:21:01,404 --> 00:21:02,504
I remember.

225
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
I'm having it mended.

226
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:08,835
I remembered it because it
reminded me of my father.

227
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:10,236
He was in the war.

228
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,190
I think we're being watched.

229
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:18,965
Watched? What do you mean?

230
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:20,919
There's a man in a hat.

231
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,287
I don't see anybody.

232
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:35,169
You know. There's so much I'd
like to share with you Edward.

233
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:38,311
and I hardly know
anything about you at all.

234
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:41,912
Other that you being a
particularly bright student.

235
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,910
I feel that we have a

236
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:50,502
kind of kindred spirit.

237
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:55,381
I really should be going.

238
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:57,382
No. I've started to write something.

239
00:21:57,912 --> 00:21:59,312
Perhaps you'd like to hear it?

240
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:08,712
A bud has burst on the upper bough

241
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:12,313
the linnet sang in my heart today

242
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,330
I know where the pale green grasses show

243
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,590
By a tiny runnel, off the way,

244
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:22,055
And the earth is wet.

245
00:22:22,854 --> 00:22:24,754
A cuckoo said in my brain.

246
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:27,186
Not yet. Not yet.

247
00:22:29,018 --> 00:22:30,318
I haven't finished it.

248
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:56,575
Excuse me.

249
00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:00,424
Excuse me.

250
00:23:07,572 --> 00:23:08,872
Please.

251
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:10,319
I'm sorry.

252
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,420
I can't hear.

253
00:23:23,729 --> 00:23:25,029
What's your name?

254
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:28,929
Edward.

255
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:32,367
I'm sorry. Would you say it again?

256
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,740
I have to read your lips.

257
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:35,723
Edward.

258
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,300
Hello. Edward.

259
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:40,925
I'm Laura.

260
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:42,871
I'm sorry.

261
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,672
Would you say that again?

262
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:15,017
There isn't one person in a hundred

263
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:16,518
who would walk by a hat on a bench

264
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,919
without giving it a second look.

265
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,380
That says a lot about you Mr. Wilson.

266
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:22,981
You don't distract easily.

267
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:26,961
She's a very pretty girl.

268
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,680
Sam Murach. I'm with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

269
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,170
Mind if I walk along with you?

270
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,480
I had a chance to have a talk
with a fraternity brother of yours.

271
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:46,081
John Russell. The senator's son.

272
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,200
John said you might help us.

273
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,090
You're friendly with Dr. Fredericks?

274
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:53,491
He's my thesis advisor
if that's what you mean.

275
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,192
He's been recruiting faculty members

276
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,893
and students to join an organization

277
00:24:56,894 --> 00:24:58,494
called the American-German
Cultural Committee.

278
00:24:59,785 --> 00:25:00,785
It's a Nazi front.

279
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:01,786
Does he talk to you about that?

280
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:06,793
I'm a poetry student Mr. Murach.

281
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:09,866
I'm not political.

282
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:12,025
We'd be very interested in
finding out the names of some

283
00:25:12,026 --> 00:25:13,526
of the other organizers
for the cultural committee.

284
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:17,615
Are you asking me to
spy on Dr. Fredericks?

285
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:19,794
I'm asking you to be a good citizen.

286
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,851
You blow that thing up it'll be fine.

287
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,652
I'll be seeing you.

288
00:25:40,368 --> 00:25:44,868
In Poland, Hitler watches German
regiments steam across the river San.

289
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:46,695
This was part of the river line

290
00:25:46,696 --> 00:25:49,896
which the invading army
forced in its flanking drive

291
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:51,297
through southern Poland.

292
00:25:52,198 --> 00:25:55,098
The Nazi Fuehrer make a quick
tour in the conquered nation

293
00:25:55,157 --> 00:25:56,957
among the soldiers in captured towns.

294
00:25:58,983 --> 00:26:01,883
Hitler has given the
word of War and War it is.

295
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:04,384
Poland has been guaranteed
by Great Britain.... ?????

296
00:26:04,385 --> 00:26:07,585
It is a great privilege to have
with us here tonight Mr. Haupt.

297
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:09,703
The Fuehrer’s education minister.

298
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:10,945
Mr. Haupt.

299
00:26:11,546 --> 00:26:12,772
Good evening.

300
00:26:12,773 --> 00:26:13,773
Thank you Dr. Fredericks,

301
00:26:13,774 --> 00:26:16,674
and members of the
American-German cultural committee

302
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,975
for giving me the opportunity
to come to you here.

303
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:19,976
Germany has always been a country....

304
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:42,911
Excuse me.

305
00:27:04,904 --> 00:27:06,304
Someone's in here!

306
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:38,401
Are you enjoying yourself Edward?

307
00:27:38,402 --> 00:27:39,402
Very much so.

308
00:27:39,903 --> 00:27:41,003
I'd like you to meet,

309
00:27:41,704 --> 00:27:43,004
Mr. Haupt.

310
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:46,836
Dr. Manheim

311
00:27:46,893 --> 00:27:47,893
Yes. We met.

312
00:27:48,128 --> 00:27:50,194
I've been asked by the faculty chairman

313
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,036
to relinquish my post here at Yale.

314
00:27:55,203 --> 00:27:56,003
Now, you'll hear many

315
00:27:56,804 --> 00:27:58,704
reasons to what caused my departure.

316
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,859
Suffice is to say

317
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,860
I'm leaving with my name intact.

318
00:28:05,194 --> 00:28:06,194
Good luck in your endeavors.

319
00:28:12,856 --> 00:28:14,456
Oh, Edward.

320
00:28:17,954 --> 00:28:19,454
What did I do to deserve this?

321
00:28:20,988 --> 00:28:22,288
Have you such little regard for me

322
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:23,289
that you betray me for my

323
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,290
political beliefs?

324
00:28:25,848 --> 00:28:26,848
You know and I know

325
00:28:28,598 --> 00:28:30,198
Trumbull Stickney wrote
that poem in 1902.

326
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:33,528
You were my teacher.

327
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:35,782
You betrayed me.

328
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:47,783
<i>piano playing</i>

329
00:28:57,071 --> 00:28:59,371
I thought we were going to a party.

330
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:07,245
You want to protect me
from them. Don't you?

331
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:08,755
No.

332
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:10,178
You think they will make fun of me....

333
00:29:10,257 --> 00:29:12,257
That's not it. That's not true.

334
00:29:13,145 --> 00:29:14,145
It's OK.

335
00:29:21,942 --> 00:29:23,942
I'm happy to be with you.

336
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,501
Would you like to dance?

337
00:29:35,495 --> 00:29:37,295
I'm not a very good dancer.

338
00:29:37,403 --> 00:29:39,203
That's alright. I'm not
a good dancer either.

339
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:52,578
How does this song go?

340
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:00,172
Blue sky

341
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:05,691
smiling at me

342
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:13,049
nothing but blue sky

343
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:18,198
do I see.

344
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:27,441
Excuse me everybody,
I have an announcement.

345
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,379
I've just been told England and
France declared war on Germany.

346
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,710
But please continue dancing
and enjoying our music

347
00:30:35,478 --> 00:30:37,378
and I'll update you as
information comes in.

348
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:38,612
Thank you.

349
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:55,558
Before long, we'll be at war too.

350
00:31:04,956 --> 00:31:06,956
Would you like to get a room for us.

351
00:31:42,865 --> 00:31:44,165
Turn down the light.

352
00:31:56,325 --> 00:31:57,325
I can't.

353
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,240
I can't.

354
00:32:18,154 --> 00:32:19,154
Good night.

355
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:20,641
Good night.

356
00:32:31,988 --> 00:32:32,988
Thank you Edward.

357
00:32:34,646 --> 00:32:35,646
For what?

358
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:37,809
For being so nice.

359
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,940
In view of the fact we're taking a

360
00:33:08,941 --> 00:33:11,641
propaganda lambasting around the world

361
00:33:11,642 --> 00:33:13,342
Why is it not useful, Sir

362
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:15,143
for us to explore with you

363
00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:19,044
the real facts behind
this or our motivations.

364
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:21,338
There's an old saying that a

365
00:33:21,606 --> 00:33:24,406
victory has a hundred fathers
and defeat is an orphan.

366
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:26,037
And I wouldn't be surprised if...

367
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,275
Hello Edward.

368
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,200
What are you doing here.

369
00:33:38,437 --> 00:33:39,837
There are only a handful of us

370
00:33:39,838 --> 00:33:41,338
until moment zero

371
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:43,839
who know where we were
going to land in Cuba.

372
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:46,911
One of us couldn't keep a secret.

373
00:33:49,232 --> 00:33:50,717
I know it wasn't me.

374
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:54,347
Mr. Allen ask for
the Zapata list of personnel

375
00:33:54,348 --> 00:33:56,148
who participated in the operation.

376
00:33:58,665 --> 00:33:59,765
I don't have one.

377
00:33:59,853 --> 00:34:01,853
Tell Mr. Allen I give
him the list personally.

378
00:34:01,854 --> 00:34:02,930
We're in the same boat together.

379
00:34:05,424 --> 00:34:06,624
A leaking boat.

380
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,625
Don't ever think we're in
the same boat Mr. Hayes.

381
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:10,226
We're either going to sink or swim.

382
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,420
Together

383
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,985
People like us..

384
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:18,505
we don't let each other drown.

385
00:34:27,487 --> 00:34:31,187
I've said as much as I
feel can be usefully said

386
00:34:31,188 --> 00:34:32,488
by me.

387
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,089
In regard to the events
of the past few days.

388
00:34:35,726 --> 00:34:36,726
through the statements,

389
00:34:37,615 --> 00:34:39,715
detailed discussions.

390
00:34:40,386 --> 00:34:41,386
I'm not to....

391
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:55,207
Mother. Father.

392
00:34:55,997 --> 00:34:57,797
This is Edward Wilson.

393
00:34:57,798 --> 00:34:58,798
Mrs. Russell.

394
00:34:58,799 --> 00:34:59,799
Senator.

395
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,400
Yes. It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

396
00:35:02,124 --> 00:35:03,424
Phillip and Toddy Allen.

397
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:08,166
Mr. Allen was president
of Bones class of '12.

398
00:35:08,488 --> 00:35:09,788
Welcome to our little clubhouse.

399
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:10,789
Thank you.

400
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,790
Where's Clover?

401
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:13,266
Ah. There she is.

402
00:35:17,807 --> 00:35:18,807
This is my sister Clover.

403
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Hello. I'm Edward.

404
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:23,601
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

405
00:35:26,129 --> 00:35:27,729
Bonesmen.

406
00:35:29,123 --> 00:35:30,423
All here!

407
00:35:31,907 --> 00:35:33,507
Reverend Collin will offer grace.

408
00:35:34,305 --> 00:35:35,738
Bonesmen first. Dear God...

409
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:36,938
God second

410
00:35:36,939 --> 00:35:40,139
we thank you for guiding
the Evans' family trust

411
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,640
in the care of our beloved island.

412
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:46,703
So that we may come here with
our families and our friends

413
00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:49,304
In comfort and in privacy.

414
00:35:57,145 --> 00:35:58,845
He said he was going to ask me to dance.

415
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:02,001
Here we go.

416
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,460
Don't you dance Mr. Wilson.

417
00:36:20,773 --> 00:36:21,873
Nobody asked me.

418
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:23,988
Oh.

419
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,376
Well.

420
00:36:28,423 --> 00:36:30,223
I think I will take my chances.

421
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:33,602
I'm asking you.

422
00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:55,065
John is very fond of you.

423
00:36:55,364 --> 00:36:56,764
And I am very fond of him.

424
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:59,496
He's talking of going off
to fight with the English.

425
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:03,049
My father isn't particularly
pleased about it. Because

426
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,483
He's one of the organizers
of America First.

427
00:37:06,354 --> 00:37:09,454
I'm not very good for an
isolationist's son to go off to war

428
00:37:09,455 --> 00:37:10,155
what if....

429
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:12,174
Your brother John is a
man of great conviction.

430
00:37:13,175 --> 00:37:14,375
I admire him.

431
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:15,376
What about you Mr. Wilson?

432
00:37:15,377 --> 00:37:16,377
What do you believe in?

433
00:37:20,076 --> 00:37:21,076
Are you in school?

434
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,830
You don't say very much. Do you?

435
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:33,534
When there is something worth saying...

436
00:37:35,944 --> 00:37:36,644
Oh!

437
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:37,653
Well.

438
00:37:37,654 --> 00:37:38,654
I think I'm going to like you.

439
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:48,214
Mr. Hayes.

440
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:49,910
Gentlemen.

441
00:37:56,562 --> 00:37:58,062
General William Sullivan.

442
00:37:58,173 --> 00:37:59,573
Mr. Edward Wilson.

443
00:37:59,574 --> 00:38:00,574
It's a great honor sir.

444
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:02,475
I'd get up and shake your hand

445
00:38:02,476 --> 00:38:04,376
but my fucking feet are killing me.

446
00:38:04,377 --> 00:38:07,077
Something about too much
sugar in my blood and my urine.

447
00:38:08,145 --> 00:38:10,145
So when do you boys start
your pissing contest?

448
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,589
I'll excuse myself.

449
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,654
Thank you Phillip.

450
00:38:22,364 --> 00:38:24,064
Why don't you sit down.

451
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:39,064
You understand that whatever we
discuss here doesn’t leave this room?

452
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,519
Of course.

453
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,240
We'll eventually get
involved in this war.

454
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:46,241
Not because we want to

455
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:47,242
but because we have to

456
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:48,243
and we should.

457
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:52,537
And the president has asked me to look
into creating a foreign intelligence service

458
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,538
and if that happens

459
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,339
I'll be looking for patriotic,
honorable, bright young men,

460
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,040
from the right backgrounds to
manage the various departments.

461
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:01,641
In other words no Jews or negroes

462
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:03,442
and very few Catholics.

463
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:04,943
That's only because I'm a Catholic.

464
00:39:07,486 --> 00:39:10,686
You'd be trained and commissioned
in the Army and posted overseas.

465
00:39:10,687 --> 00:39:14,187
If it's something you’re interested in you'd
have to be ready to leave at a moment’s notice.

466
00:39:16,936 --> 00:39:18,836
I don't want your answer
now. Just think about it.

467
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:22,969
But this isn't a bunch of fraternity boys
sitting around playing with their pricks.

468
00:39:23,396 --> 00:39:24,396
This is for real.

469
00:39:24,754 --> 00:39:25,754
For America.

470
00:39:31,807 --> 00:39:32,907
Let’s go.

471
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,270
Have fun.

472
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:38,562
Behave yourselves.

473
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,700
I'm supposed to be looking
for the perfect husband.

474
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:49,588
Are you the perfect husband Mr. Wilson?

475
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:52,692
Perfect in every way.

476
00:39:58,306 --> 00:40:00,506
Then is there some reason that you won't

477
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,148
put your arm around me?

478
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:15,956
You are the one...

479
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,683
I like this.

480
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:21,909
Very smart.

481
00:40:25,011 --> 00:40:28,111
... or under the sun.

482
00:40:30,955 --> 00:40:31,955
Whether near to me

483
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,790
Do you have a problem
with woman Mr. Bones.

484
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:14,155
Do you love me?

485
00:41:14,156 --> 00:41:15,156
What?

486
00:41:15,157 --> 00:41:16,157
Tell me you love me.

487
00:41:18,765 --> 00:41:19,765
Do you love me.

488
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:20,766
I love you. I love you.

489
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:21,767
No. I still don't believe you.

490
00:41:23,391 --> 00:41:24,591
Say it. Say it.

491
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:26,088
Look at me.

492
00:41:26,135 --> 00:41:27,135
Stop. Stop.

493
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,870
I love you.

494
00:41:45,223 --> 00:41:48,623
As soon as the world comes to
it's senses, I'm going to travel.

495
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:53,607
London. Paris. Rome.

496
00:41:56,385 --> 00:41:57,785
You can come with me.

497
00:42:06,062 --> 00:42:07,262
Is everything alright?

498
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:13,339
Fine.

499
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:18,279
We are worlds apart.

500
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:22,303
What do you mean?

501
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,406
I feel like I'm just a curiosity to you.

502
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:27,929
That. That is not. That's not true.

503
00:42:29,276 --> 00:42:30,276
I feel like

504
00:42:30,689 --> 00:42:31,689
I'm not real to you.

505
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,690
That is not true.

506
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:33,965
Anyway...

507
00:42:33,956 --> 00:42:35,656
That's not how I feel about you.

508
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:45,525
Edward.

509
00:43:04,335 --> 00:43:05,335
John?

510
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:07,127
I've been looking everywhere for you.

511
00:43:14,153 --> 00:43:15,153
My sister.

512
00:43:15,154 --> 00:43:16,154
She's pregnant

513
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,490
I know you'll do what's expected of you.

514
00:43:38,484 --> 00:43:41,074
Do you Edward L. Wilson

515
00:43:41,033 --> 00:43:43,433
take Margaret N. Russell

516
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,400
to be your lawfully wedded wife.

517
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:49,734
to love, honor and cherish

518
00:43:50,281 --> 00:43:52,281
in sickness and in health

519
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:56,289
in good times and in bad times

520
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,560
until death do you apart.

521
00:43:58,091 --> 00:43:59,091
I do.

522
00:43:59,813 --> 00:44:01,813
I now pronounce you man and wife.

523
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:19,641
A man if uniform want to see you.

524
00:44:20,681 --> 00:44:21,681
Excuse me mother.

525
00:44:23,446 --> 00:44:24,646
Did your mother or I ever
tell you where we ....

526
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:30,253
Mr. Edward Wilson.

527
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:32,408
We need to speak alone sir.

528
00:44:33,585 --> 00:44:35,285
Would you like to sit down?

529
00:44:35,286 --> 00:44:36,286
No. Thank you sir.

530
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:38,287
General Sullivan sends his regards.

531
00:44:38,735 --> 00:44:41,235
and to ask you if your still interested
in seeing the rest of the World.

532
00:44:42,665 --> 00:44:44,265
Yes I...I certainly would be.

533
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:48,434
Good afternoon sir.

534
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:49,935
Thank you.

535
00:45:08,088 --> 00:45:09,588
My orders came through.

536
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:10,589
I'll be going overseas.

537
00:45:13,113 --> 00:45:14,313
When?

538
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:17,676
In one week.

539
00:45:18,547 --> 00:45:20,147
What are you going to do Edward?

540
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:21,517
Save the World?

541
00:45:37,366 --> 00:45:39,566
Your are safe here with me.

542
00:45:45,207 --> 00:45:47,007
The photograph is particularly dark.

543
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,490
As we can see there is a Caucasian man

544
00:45:49,491 --> 00:45:50,891
and a negro woman.

545
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:54,039
The resolution breaks
down pretty quickly.

546
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,460
The film stock is definitely Russian.

547
00:45:56,652 --> 00:45:57,652
Low grade.

548
00:46:00,472 --> 00:46:01,972
One of the areas we've been focusing on

549
00:46:01,973 --> 00:46:02,973
is the mosquito netting...

550
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,039
The mosquito netting is predominantly in

551
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:08,661
Africa, southeast Asia,
any tropical climate.

552
00:46:08,662 --> 00:46:10,362
The window curtains here

553
00:46:10,363 --> 00:46:14,463
have a distinctive pattern
on them of Baobab trees.

554
00:46:14,464 --> 00:46:16,364
Also seen in Africa.

555
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:18,306
Next to the curtains

556
00:46:18,307 --> 00:46:20,007
we can see the building's ballestry.

557
00:46:20,808 --> 00:46:23,182
There's a pigeon here. It's
kind of hard to make out.

558
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,130
Pigeons are mostly found in urban areas

559
00:46:25,131 --> 00:46:26,131
town squares...

560
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:29,090
If you listen closely
you will hear an airplane.

561
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:32,735
We've washed it out.

562
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:37,967
By the sound of the
thrust of the jet engines

563
00:46:37,968 --> 00:46:40,168
we can determine that
it's a plane taking off

564
00:46:40,169 --> 00:46:41,769
no more than 1000 feet off the ground.

565
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,070
Which would further
suggest a large urban area.

566
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:45,869
On a section of the tape

567
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,170
when you clear up background noise

568
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:49,071
you can hear a female voice.

569
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:50,072
I love you.

570
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:53,695
People who really love each
other don't have secrets.

571
00:46:54,471 --> 00:46:55,471
Your are safe here.

572
00:46:55,472 --> 00:46:57,454
Assuming we're talking
about the same woman,

573
00:46:57,454 --> 00:46:59,567
the linguists tell us
her accent is French.

574
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,030
There's one word here
we can't make it out yet.

575
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:07,556
There is an unidentifiable
noise washing her out.

576
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,743
Placed throughout the
recording at a high frequency

577
00:47:12,744 --> 00:47:15,020
suggests an air raid siren of some sort.

578
00:47:16,532 --> 00:47:17,745
We're going to keep playing with it.

579
00:47:22,585 --> 00:47:25,265
This is the time fore
everyone to stand together

580
00:47:25,397 --> 00:47:26,732
and hold firm

581
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:28,389
as they are doing.

582
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:30,501
I express my admiration

583
00:47:31,105 --> 00:47:32,231
for the exemplary manner

584
00:47:32,709 --> 00:47:36,271
in which all the air raid
precaution services of London

585
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:37,272
are being discharged.

586
00:47:37,273 --> 00:47:38,273
May I help you?

587
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:39,274
Yes.

588
00:47:39,275 --> 00:47:41,792
I here to see the tailor
about a fitting for a new suit.

589
00:47:41,898 --> 00:47:44,861
Certainly, and what kind of suit
would you be interested this evening?

590
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:45,862
A tweed or worsted.

591
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:46,863
Perhaps a nice gabardine.

592
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,223
Perhaps, a worsted and a tweed.

593
00:47:49,224 --> 00:47:50,442
Both single breasted?

594
00:47:50,607 --> 00:47:51,216
Yes.

595
00:47:51,217 --> 00:47:52,654
Two or three buns, sir.

596
00:47:52,966 --> 00:47:53,771
Three buns.

597
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:58,659
If you might come this way, please sir.

598
00:48:07,895 --> 00:48:10,394
Please.  Our senior tailor
will be right with you, sir.

599
00:48:10,459 --> 00:48:11,459
Thank you.

600
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,654
Welcome to London.

601
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:27,164
You're going to have to learn

602
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:29,064
as quickly and thoroughly as  possible

603
00:48:29,065 --> 00:48:31,438
the English system of intelligence.

604
00:48:31,551 --> 00:48:34,823
The black cards, particularly
counter intelligence.

605
00:48:35,652 --> 00:48:38,548
The uses of information, disinformation

606
00:48:39,045 --> 00:48:41,454
and how their use is ultimately...

607
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,918
power.

608
00:48:48,287 --> 00:48:50,663
They've agreed to open
their operations to us.

609
00:48:52,193 --> 00:48:53,823
They can't win the war without us

610
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,358
but they don't really want us here.

611
00:48:56,449 --> 00:48:59,077
Intelligence, is their mother's
milk and they don't like sharing

612
00:48:59,112 --> 00:49:01,355
the royal tit with people
that don't have titles.

613
00:49:02,624 --> 00:49:04,625
Your London tutor is
waiting to meet you.

614
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:06,233
This way sir.

615
00:49:32,898 --> 00:49:35,454
I should've know better
that to use Stickney.

616
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,875
Job well done Mr. Wilson.

617
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:40,251
You blew a two year operation for me.

618
00:49:41,126 --> 00:49:43,300
I told general Sullivan
to keep an eye on you.

619
00:49:43,965 --> 00:49:45,166
Just as well, really.

620
00:49:46,013 --> 00:49:49,603
I was beginning to long for
the bone chilling cold of home.

621
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:55,342
It isn't personal.

622
00:50:01,342 --> 00:50:02,137
Mr. Carlson.

623
00:50:02,571 --> 00:50:04,005
Is this the American Trade Bureau?

624
00:50:04,006 --> 00:50:05,106
Which product?

625
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:09,071
Dried goods.

626
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:10,833
You’re late.

627
00:50:10,847 --> 00:50:12,155
Yeah. That's what my mother said.

628
00:50:15,266 --> 00:50:16,412
Raymond Ducca Brocco,

629
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,356
born may 8th, 1907, New York City.

630
00:50:19,752 --> 00:50:21,255
St. Ignatius High School,

631
00:50:21,256 --> 00:50:22,256
Fordham University.

632
00:50:22,257 --> 00:50:23,257
Married Anita Delveccio.

633
00:50:23,258 --> 00:50:24,258
2 children...

634
00:50:24,259 --> 00:50:25,259
Stephanie and David.

635
00:50:31,044 --> 00:50:32,717
Six foot two, 182 pounds,

636
00:50:32,718 --> 00:50:33,718
black hair, brown eyes,

637
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:35,309
military record, 5 years,

638
00:50:35,344 --> 00:50:36,434
intelligence.

639
00:50:36,902 --> 00:50:38,189
Anything you'd like to add?

640
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,724
You want to look up my ass too?

641
00:50:41,812 --> 00:50:43,575
You're working for me Sergeant Brocco.

642
00:50:43,576 --> 00:50:44,576
I'm working for the
Unites States government...

643
00:50:44,577 --> 00:50:46,740
In this office I am the
United States government.

644
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:48,773
You're pretty sure of yourself
for somebody who just began...

645
00:50:49,658 --> 00:50:50,768
They wouldn't tell me your name.

646
00:50:50,872 --> 00:50:52,421
Then how do you know you're
not in the wrong place.

647
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:55,253
They said you were a serious SOB
that didn't have any a sense of humor.

648
00:50:56,148 --> 00:50:56,941
Can't be two of you.

649
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:59,738
<i>phone rings</i>

650
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:08,774
Are you going to answering it.

651
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:10,536
Depends if I'm working
for you or if I'm not.

652
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,843
One of your jobs, sergeant,
is answering the telephone.

653
00:51:14,428 --> 00:51:15,339
Yes sir.

654
00:51:20,317 --> 00:51:22,007
Use your tradecraft well,

655
00:51:22,396 --> 00:51:24,358
particularly in the
use of black propaganda.

656
00:51:24,713 --> 00:51:26,415
and the ingredient known as playback.

657
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:29,457
Understanding how effectively
your own disinformation

658
00:51:29,529 --> 00:51:30,793
is actually working on the enemy.

659
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:34,424
It's almost four.

660
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:36,325
How do you spell syphilis.
Is it one L or two.

661
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:38,224
Syphilis.

662
00:51:38,259 --> 00:51:39,640
One....I think.

663
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:44,808
It's vital to penetrate the
enemies intelligent services.

664
00:51:45,493 --> 00:51:47,871
Push them into an
unreal world, as it were.

665
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:49,153
Doctor in England today

666
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:52,509
announced that medical records taken
from Adolf Hitler's personal physician

667
00:51:52,926 --> 00:51:53,686
Dr. Theodore Morell

668
00:51:53,999 --> 00:51:56,176
reveal that Mr. Hitler
had contracted syphilis

669
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:59,750
while serving the German armed
forces during World War I.

670
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,251
The very qualities that make
a good intelligence officer

671
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,471
a suspicions mind

672
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:06,961
a love of complexity and detail,

673
00:52:07,373 --> 00:52:10,418
are the very qualities of
someone you've been observing.

674
00:52:22,578 --> 00:52:23,842
Good evening Lord Cooper.

675
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,332
I have some information that
might be of some interest to you.

676
00:52:26,367 --> 00:52:29,966
The mental facility to detect
conspiracies and betrayal

677
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:33,812
are the same qualities most likely
to corrode natural judgment.

678
00:52:33,847 --> 00:52:36,976
Everything that seems clear is bent

679
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:39,714
and everything that seems bent is clear.

680
00:52:39,749 --> 00:52:42,852
Trapped in reflections
you must learn to recognize

681
00:52:42,887 --> 00:52:45,406
when a lie masquerades as the truth.

682
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:47,526
And then deal with it efficiently,

683
00:52:47,508 --> 00:52:48,826
dispassionately.

684
00:52:49,141 --> 00:52:51,628
We know you've been passing
information to the German high command.

685
00:52:51,629 --> 00:52:53,691
Don't give anyone time to think.

686
00:52:53,692 --> 00:52:56,161
Now, I'm going to offer
you one of two choices.

687
00:52:56,162 --> 00:52:58,022
You set the tone of the discussion.

688
00:52:58,023 --> 00:52:59,023
And quickly come to the point.

689
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:03,597
Either you can be executed for treason
or you can continue to spy for the enemy

690
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:06,031
and provide them with the
information we provide you.

691
00:53:06,032 --> 00:53:08,160
Pass this on to your German friends

692
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:09,559
and if I find out it wasn't done

693
00:53:09,594 --> 00:53:10,615
there won't be a second chance.

694
00:53:10,616 --> 00:53:12,736
You, quite simply, behave as a spy.

695
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:13,712
Do we understand each other?

696
00:53:13,713 --> 00:53:16,054
How do we know he won't
be working for two master?

697
00:53:16,487 --> 00:53:17,376
Precisely?

698
00:53:17,411 --> 00:53:18,734
We don't.

699
00:53:19,643 --> 00:53:21,259
How do I know if I can even trust you.

700
00:53:21,294 --> 00:53:22,312
You won't.

701
00:53:23,529 --> 00:53:26,689
I mean, I hope you're lucky enough
you'll meet someone you trust.

702
00:53:27,553 --> 00:53:28,938
I've got to say....

703
00:53:29,892 --> 00:53:30,993
I haven't.

704
00:53:36,206 --> 00:53:37,429
You must be young Edward.

705
00:53:37,864 --> 00:53:39,912
Dr. Frederick has told
me so much about you.

706
00:53:40,445 --> 00:53:41,311
Arch Cummings.

707
00:53:41,329 --> 00:53:42,034
Nice to meet you.

708
00:53:42,084 --> 00:53:42,880
Nice to meet you.

709
00:53:43,749 --> 00:53:45,993
I understand we are like
minded on many things

710
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:48,751
Good school boys. Yale. Cambridge.

711
00:53:49,746 --> 00:53:50,835
Dreamers.

712
00:53:52,043 --> 00:53:54,513
They say he's been an
exceptional intelligence officer.

713
00:53:56,088 --> 00:53:57,625
You have to have a steady mind and

714
00:53:57,632 --> 00:54:01,166
and an unwavering sense of
belief in what you're doing

715
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:03,389
and to be a hopeless romantic.

Hello.

720
00:54:24,837 --> 00:54:27,252
Yes, Yeah Ah, Yes. I can hear you.

721

Thank you for telling me.

Good bye.

723
00:54:40,229 --> 00:54:41,240
We had a boy.

724
00:54:43,765 --> 00:54:45,339
Would you mind if we called him Edward?

725
00:54:46,143 --> 00:54:47,582
If we called him Edward Jr?

726
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:49,997
I love that. I think it's perfect.

727
00:54:50,892 --> 00:54:52,006
Fit of a king.

728
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:55,369
That's what I was
thinking. Fit for a king.

729
00:54:55,409 --> 00:54:56,244
You like Edward?

730
00:54:58,166 --> 00:54:59,530
Oh. I think he likes it.

saving the World and keeping us safe?

733
00:55:06,174 --> 00:55:07,174
Sometimes.

734
00:55:09,045 --> 00:55:10,511
What color are his eyes?

735
00:55:11,382 --> 00:55:13,341
<i>static</i>

736
00:55:13,304 --> 00:55:15,941
Hello? Hello?

737
00:55:23,622 --> 00:55:26,146
When he's old enough
you can read it to him.

738
00:55:26,479 --> 00:55:27,762
It's a first edition.

739
00:55:28,641 --> 00:55:31,147
Charles Dickens. A Christmas
Carol. It was my fathers'.

740
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:34,005
He would read it to me when I was a boy.

741
00:55:34,908 --> 00:55:35,679
Thank you.

742
00:55:38,093 --> 00:55:40,318
I had an unfortunate discovery today.

743
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:46,704
A man that works for me said just as at my
door I found out he had given a rose to a woman.

744
00:55:47,191 --> 00:55:49,575
with a small note, the rose was quite lovely.

745
00:55:49,576 --> 00:55:50,700
An Abyssinian rose.

746
00:55:50,701 --> 00:55:53,579
With stem neatly wrapped in silk paper

747
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,207
quite beautiful and touching.

748
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:56,856
Save for the fact

749
00:55:57,156 --> 00:56:00,779
that the paper was filled with
secret writing for her German friends

750
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,795
detailing changes to the
American order of battle here.

751
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:06,242
Excuse me sir.

752
00:56:07,977 --> 00:56:09,140
Thank you.

753
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,141
Thank you sir.

754
00:56:11,311 --> 00:56:12,830
How did the Irish poet say it?

755
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:13,831
Hmm?

756
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:15,614
E'er friend for today,

757
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:18,530
is tomorrow's heartbreak

758
00:56:19,135 --> 00:56:21,347
Do you know what my deepest fear is?

759
00:56:21,555 --> 00:56:24,015
That I will end up....friendless.

760
00:56:24,737 --> 00:56:26,047
Completely alone.

761
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:30,983
I think you two know each other.

762
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:33,042
Richard!

763
00:56:33,105 --> 00:56:33,888
Hello Edward.

764
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:34,889
I didn't expect to see you.

765
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,544
Mr. Hayes has come over to work
with us in special operations.

766
00:56:38,212 --> 00:56:41,845
I hope you don't mind I invited
him to join our conversation.

767
00:56:51,763 --> 00:56:55,976
I'm afraid our dear English teacher has
a bad habit of making easy friendships.

768
00:56:59,476 --> 00:57:02,218
You know, of course, about
his ridiculous sexual tastes.

769
00:57:07,453 --> 00:57:10,832
I'm afraid he is not being very
discriminating in his partners.

770
00:57:11,782 --> 00:57:14,959
Some people are extremely
worried about his exposure.

771
00:57:19,263 --> 00:57:22,598
I hope you two can help sort this
rather delicate matter out for us.

772
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:40,033
Seem to me to be a
problem for the Bristish.

773
00:57:41,047 --> 00:57:42,239
Why are we involved?

774
00:57:43,816 --> 00:57:46,023
The British are a civilized people.

775
00:57:46,957 --> 00:57:48,303
They don't ????? their own.

776
00:57:48,524 --> 00:57:50,120
They have somebody do it for them.

777
00:57:52,622 --> 00:57:54,278
So why are you telling me.

778
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,352
I'm giving you an opportunity to handle it.

779
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,947
Or somebody else will.

780
00:58:15,814 --> 00:58:18,189
I'm sorry you've been brought into this.

781
00:58:20,135 --> 00:58:23,440
If the headmaster won't listen to
reason who might want to tie your shoe.

782
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:27,385
Sorry it has to be this way.

783
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,968
It's not something I'm happy
about having to be doing.

784
00:58:44,281 --> 00:58:46,027
Have you thought at all about

785
00:58:46,028 --> 00:58:48,732
maybe going back to
teaching again? Sometime?

786
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:53,495
They are concerned about my
personal associations.  Aren't they?

787
00:58:54,098 --> 00:58:56,635
Cambridge boys stick together like glue.

788
00:58:57,987 --> 00:59:00,440
I'm far too democratic in my taste for them.

789
00:59:01,545 --> 00:59:04,402
They like pressed trousers
and proper buttons.

790
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:07,395
No.

791
00:59:07,927 --> 00:59:10,118
I've done all the
teaching I intend to do.

792
00:59:11,236 --> 00:59:12,667
I am who I am.

793
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:15,807
I'll suffer that.

794
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:23,365
Please. You've given them all the service that you can.

795
00:59:25,205 --> 00:59:26,379
It's time to retire.

796
00:59:30,269 --> 00:59:32,359
The good schoolboy will be close by.

797
00:59:33,568 --> 00:59:35,255
You won't want to know my response.

798
00:59:38,939 --> 00:59:40,058
I understand.

799
00:59:40,616 --> 00:59:41,806
If you want to tie your shoe.

800
00:59:44,822 --> 00:59:46,434
It's a dirty business Edward.

801
00:59:46,435 --> 00:59:49,334
I've been part of it for far too long.

802
01:00:09,675 --> 01:00:13,451
You might want to think about getting
yourself a new pair of shoes Edward.

803
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:18,054
There's a wonderful shop at St. James'.

804
01:00:18,055 --> 01:00:19,880
Mr. Pendingbones.

805
01:00:20,856 --> 01:00:22,576
He's boot maker to the king.

806
01:00:23,913 --> 01:00:24,367
But then....

807
01:00:24,534 --> 01:00:26,711
I suppose we all  are in our own way, aren’t we?

808
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:28,796
boot makers to kings.

809
01:00:33,789 --> 01:00:35,800
Get out while you still can.

810
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:42,415
While you still believe.

811
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:29,700
I'm sorry.

812
01:02:37,957 --> 01:02:39,816
He knew too much.

813
01:02:43,777 --> 01:02:45,263
You understand?

814
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:15,289
It appears the word we couldn't make out

815
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:18,134
had it's sound wave significantly
clipped by whoever made this tape.

816
01:03:18,739 --> 01:03:21,199
We restored it by amplifying specific frequencies

817
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,200
seen on the oscilloscope.

818
01:03:23,684 --> 01:03:25,365
Cochinos is Spanish for pigs.

819
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:26,366
Let me hear it again.

820
01:03:31,803 --> 01:03:32,981
<i>cochinos</i>

821
01:03:33,411 --> 01:03:37,163
And the siren noise we couldn't
pinpoint before were hiding church bells.

822
01:03:40,304 --> 01:03:43,536
For some reason other noises
were added to distort the bells.

823
01:03:43,537 --> 01:03:45,079
In the makeup table's mirror

824
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,750
we can actually make out the
reflection of a church steeple

825
01:03:47,751 --> 01:03:51,104
whose three belfries correspond
with the bells you hear.

826
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,295
The volume indicates that the church is across the street.

827
01:03:56,296 --> 01:03:58,191
Again, possibly on a town square.

828
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:01,906
On the night stand, we can see a clock radio.

829
01:04:03,753 --> 01:04:05,756
It reads almost 10 o'clock

830
01:04:05,955 --> 01:04:07,789
which would correspond
with the church bells.

831
01:04:08,602 --> 01:04:10,659
I also have audio of the ceiling fan.

832
01:04:12,061 --> 01:04:15,045
It's a four blade standard ceiling
fan. We don't know where it's from.

833
01:04:16,497 --> 01:04:17,385
There is something here....

834
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:19,943
could be nothing significant.

835
01:04:19,944 --> 01:04:21,889
Maybe a candle, a paper weight.

836
01:04:22,504 --> 01:04:25,775
Or it may be something personal that we
can identify the people in the room with.

837
01:04:26,627 --> 01:04:28,794
We are going to wash it
again. Maybe see what's there.

838
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:31,864
How long till there some

839
01:04:33,229 --> 01:04:35,567
definition as to exactly where we are?

840
01:04:36,983 --> 01:04:38,366
We're going as quickly as we can sir.

841
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,952
How are Clover and your little boy?

842
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:52,976
Good. Thank you. You
know he is almost five.

843
01:04:54,288 --> 01:04:56,255
You may ????? for yourself in London.

844
01:04:57,615 --> 01:04:58,934
The World War is over.

845
01:04:59,179 --> 01:05:01,314
The war for the World has just begun

846
01:05:01,266 --> 01:05:02,400
and in every liberated country

847
01:05:02,401 --> 01:05:04,244
there will be a battle
between us and the Russians

848
01:05:04,335 --> 01:05:05,435
for their hearts and minds.

849
01:05:08,425 --> 01:05:09,624
Since we dropped the Bomb

850
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:11,693
they're feeling a little
short between the legs.

851
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:14,086
But the Russians still live in the nineteenth century.

852
01:05:14,287 --> 01:05:15,087
Beets and potatoes.

853
01:05:16,295 --> 01:05:17,773
All that will change dramatically.

854
01:05:17,774 --> 01:05:19,823
But right now, they're gobbling up territory

855
01:05:20,066 --> 01:05:21,922
taking home every
scientist they can steal.

856
01:05:22,433 --> 01:05:24,248
In ten years, they'll have a Bomb.

857
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:28,169
We have to get anyone that can
be useful to us out of Berlin

858
01:05:28,446 --> 01:05:28,875
before they do.

859
01:05:34,522 --> 01:05:35,800
Churchill was right.

860
01:05:36,936 --> 01:05:39,311
We shouldn't have stopped
marching until we reached Moscow.

861
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:44,216
They're from Switzerland.

862
01:05:44,217 --> 01:05:47,439
I had them sent, with a pouch, to Berlin.

863
01:05:48,024 --> 01:05:49,511
They're a weakness of mine.

864
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:52,445
When I was a child, my mother would
always reward me with a chocolate.

865
01:05:55,797 --> 01:05:57,128
It's a dreadful habit.

866
01:05:57,672 --> 01:05:59,721
The chocolates or seeking approval?

867
01:06:01,152 --> 01:06:01,905
Both.

868
01:06:04,936 --> 01:06:07,698
He was an officer it the Abwehr,
German military intelligence.

869
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:15,069
He says he knows the location of certain
Nazi V-2 rocket scientist in hiding.

870
01:06:15,268 --> 01:06:16,502
Ask him where he wants to go.

871
01:06:20,794 --> 01:06:23,117
He wants to go to Chicago.
He has relatives there.

872
01:06:23,823 --> 01:06:26,123
Tell him if he provides us
with the names and locations

873
01:06:26,165 --> 01:06:29,019
of the scientists I'll
arrange an exit visa for him.

874
01:06:29,866 --> 01:06:31,214
As soon as he serves his purpose,

875
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:32,695
turn him over to the Nazi catchers.

876
01:06:44,002 --> 01:06:45,492
The next ????? is a group commander

877
01:06:45,561 --> 01:06:47,458
would like to speak with you about asylum.

878
01:06:53,206 --> 01:06:54,598
It's very ugly, isn't it?

879
01:06:54,763 --> 01:06:57,460
It isn't meant to be jewelry.

880
01:06:58,494 --> 01:07:01,259
I lost the sound in one ear, altogether.

881
01:07:01,525 --> 01:07:04,733
I can hear with the help of the apparatus

882
01:07:04,734 --> 01:07:06,877
out of this ear, but they
say in one year or so....

883
01:07:06,912 --> 01:07:08,435
You hardly notice it's there.

884
01:07:15,151 --> 01:07:17,830
The Russians are interested
in making a prisoner swap.

885
01:07:43,921 --> 01:07:48,416
We're prepare to offer you some
Jewish scientists liberated in the east

886
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:51,657
for some Nazi scientists
living here in Berlin.

887
01:08:00,472 --> 01:08:02,883
These are the names
we're willing to discuss.

888
01:08:38,578 --> 01:08:41,881
I understand your
cryptonym for me is Ulysses.

889
01:08:43,296 --> 01:08:46,621
Isn't that from the James
Joyce book or the Greek myth.

890
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,311
Do you what our code name is for you?

891
01:09:00,217 --> 01:09:01,279
Mother.

892
01:09:05,002 --> 01:09:08,710
A took the first hot bath
yesterday I've taken in three years.

893
01:09:09,409 --> 01:09:11,420
Since the siege of Stalingrad.

894
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:15,337
I sat for hours...

895
01:09:16,315 --> 01:09:18,500
looking out the window,

896
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:20,851
soaking.

897
01:09:34,334 --> 01:09:35,817
When I was a soldier

898
01:09:35,818 --> 01:09:37,575
my fingers we're frost bitten.

899
01:09:39,272 --> 01:09:41,143
Since then, when I get cold

900
01:09:41,949 --> 01:09:43,646
there is a pain.

901
01:09:47,176 --> 01:09:48,855
Maybe you shouldn't live in Russia.

902
01:09:51,222 --> 01:09:53,160
We all have our weaknesses.

903
01:09:55,518 --> 01:09:56,787
What is yours?

904
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:02,153
I had heard you were silent.

905
01:10:03,984 --> 01:10:05,551
Made of stone, they said.

906
01:10:07,197 --> 01:10:08,785
What is the expression?

907
01:10:10,481 --> 01:10:12,174
The silence is deafening.

908
01:10:16,221 --> 01:10:18,360
You're going to be a formidable

909
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:20,922
adversary, Mother.

910
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,709
I look forward to our association.

911
01:10:34,977 --> 01:10:37,397
I hope it lasts for a long time.

912
01:10:53,397 --> 01:10:54,800
I love you.

913
01:10:55,848 --> 01:10:58,811
People who really love each
other don't have secrets.

914
01:10:59,877 --> 01:11:01,763
You are safe here with me.

915
01:11:01,764 --> 01:11:03,631
We were able to make
out the brand of the fan.

916
01:11:03,632 --> 01:11:06,406
It's called a ?????. It's Belgian.

917
01:11:07,234 --> 01:11:08,767
The object on the night stand

918
01:11:09,374 --> 01:11:11,354
we're still trying to find out what this is.

919
01:11:12,656 --> 01:11:14,429
We just can't get any
more definition out of it.

920
01:11:20,524 --> 01:11:21,398
Who is this?

921
01:11:23,185 --> 01:11:24,435
Who is this?

922
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:27,123
Hello father.

923
01:11:27,445 --> 01:11:29,180
You have a birthday coming up.

924
01:11:29,501 --> 01:11:31,006
I'm going to be five soon.

925
01:11:31,812 --> 01:11:33,709
Well you're a big boy.

926
01:11:34,493 --> 01:11:36,931
?????

927
01:11:41,502 --> 01:11:42,726
Is your mother there?

928
01:11:42,727 --> 01:11:44,576
What? I can't hear you.

929
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:48,487
Is your mother there?

930
01:11:49,364 --> 01:11:51,454
She's getting dressed
to go out with her friend.

931
01:11:51,455 --> 01:11:52,829
He has a new car.

932
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,335
He lets me drive with him.

933
01:11:57,475 --> 01:11:59,168
Hello Mr. Wilson, this is Edna.

934
01:11:59,169 --> 01:12:00,745
Mrs. Wilson is upstairs.

935
01:12:00,947 --> 01:12:02,004
She's getting ready for dinner.

936
01:12:02,415 --> 01:12:03,919
I'll tell her you are on the phone.

937
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:07,831
I'll call back.

938
01:12:12,948 --> 01:12:13,973
<i>door knocking</i>

939
01:12:15,788 --> 01:12:16,863
Pardon me.

940
01:12:18,512 --> 01:12:20,076
Do you need me for anything else?

941
01:12:20,514 --> 01:12:21,913
No. Thank you.

942
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:23,188
Guten Nacht.

943
01:12:23,488 --> 01:12:24,499
Guten Nacht.

944
01:12:30,854 --> 01:12:32,742
Do you ever eat Mr. Wilson.

945
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:34,744
I like to cook.

946
01:12:35,879 --> 01:12:37,222
Would you like a home cooked meal?

947
01:12:46,038 --> 01:12:49,149
Have you ever read Ovid's
Metamorphosis in the original Latin?

948
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:51,600
It's quite beautiful.

949
01:12:55,651 --> 01:12:57,512
I grabbed the pile of dust

950
01:12:57,513 --> 01:12:58,513
and holding it up

951
01:12:59,821 --> 01:13:02,740
foolishly ask for as many
birthdays as the grains of dust.

952
01:13:03,831 --> 01:13:06,582
I forgot to ask that they be years of youth.

953
01:13:08,508 --> 01:13:09,043
Bravo

954
01:13:22,846 --> 01:13:24,270
I should be going.

955
01:13:32,796 --> 01:13:34,398
Would you like to stay?

956
01:13:37,941 --> 01:13:39,014
Would you like me to.

957
01:13:40,966 --> 01:13:42,357
I would like you to very much.

958
01:13:52,635 --> 01:13:54,225
Maybe we can go somewhere together?

959
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:57,178
The lakes in Bavaria are so beautiful.

960
01:13:58,636 --> 01:14:00,897
There was an inn there before the war.

961
01:14:00,898 --> 01:14:02,774
where they served
breakfast in bed all day.

962
01:14:27,264 --> 01:14:28,264
Yena ?????

963
01:14:31,516 --> 01:14:33,003
I hope you never go home.

964
01:14:36,457 --> 01:14:38,152
Bavaria is a really beautiful place.

965
01:14:40,338 --> 01:14:41,558
I was born there.

966
01:14:41,559 --> 01:14:42,731
My grandmother

967
01:14:43,633 --> 01:14:44,519
lived there.

968
01:14:45,688 --> 01:14:46,860
I really miss her.

969
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,191
Why don't we go.

970
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:08,050
I let a stranger into our house.

971
01:15:10,029 --> 01:15:11,695
<i>door knocking</i>

972
01:15:15,618 --> 01:15:16,606
Dies da?

973
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:18,738
Danka.

974
01:16:18,437 --> 01:16:21,001
Mother. Father is here.

975
01:16:21,553 --> 01:16:22,361
Mother.

976
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,331
Hello Edward.

977
01:16:32,065 --> 01:16:32,976
Hello Clover.

978
01:16:36,931 --> 01:16:37,887
I ah.

979
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:41,928
I like to be called Margaret now.

980
01:16:46,098 --> 01:16:47,455
It's very nice to see you.

981
01:16:49,852 --> 01:16:51,192
It's good to see you too.

982
01:16:54,709 --> 01:16:56,100
I made something or you.

983
01:17:00,977 --> 01:17:01,768
You see?

984
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:03,171
It's a ship.

985
01:17:05,013 --> 01:17:05,754
But it's got

986
01:17:06,393 --> 01:17:07,664
the flag of England.

987
01:17:09,598 --> 01:17:11,721
And then I put a pirate flag there.

988
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:13,711
And if you like

989
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:15,268
you can count

990
01:17:15,754 --> 01:17:17,411
how many sails are there.

991
01:17:18,486 --> 01:17:19,592
You want to try that?

992
01:17:25,857 --> 01:17:27,028
Fifteen.

993
01:17:27,264 --> 01:17:28,088
That’s right.

994
01:17:29,234 --> 01:17:30,137
Fifteen.

995
01:17:32,128 --> 01:17:33,334
No. No. It's yours.

996
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:34,556
I made it for you.

997
01:17:50,441 --> 01:17:51,730
If it's alright with you I thought

998
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:54,943
maybe we could sleep in
separate beds for a while.

999
01:17:54,944 --> 01:17:57,046
Just until we can get
to know each other again.

1000
01:17:59,196 --> 01:18:00,718
I made up the spare room.

1001
01:18:02,792 --> 01:18:03,510
All right.

1002
01:18:12,465 --> 01:18:14,068
What do you hear from your brother John.

1003
01:18:18,348 --> 01:18:20,358
I thought you knew he was killed in Burma.

1004
01:18:20,658 --> 01:18:21,659
In 1944.

1005
01:18:23,952 --> 01:18:25,750
You never mentioned it
in any of your letters.

1006
01:18:29,177 --> 01:18:30,718
There wasn't very much to say.

1007
01:18:39,702 --> 01:18:41,444
Six year is a long time.

1008
01:18:45,361 --> 01:18:46,678
I was lonely.

1009
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:48,647
And I was with a man, once.

1010
01:18:51,731 --> 01:18:53,384
He wasn't very interesting.

1011
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,212
Were you with anyone?

1012
01:19:02,444 --> 01:19:03,828
It was a mistake.

1013
01:19:20,925 --> 01:19:23,752
Thank you for the
ship you made.  For me.

1014
01:19:27,068 --> 01:19:28,080
Your welcome.

1015
01:19:29,453 --> 01:19:30,756
I'm glad you like it.

1016
01:19:32,881 --> 01:19:34,992
Mother said you were at the war.

1017
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:38,614
Did you fight? Did you kill anybody?

1018
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,104
No.

1019
01:19:47,186 --> 01:19:48,072
Good night.

1020
01:19:49,079 --> 01:19:49,798
Good night.

1021
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:12,542
Hello Father. Hello Edward. Hello

1022
01:20:13,968 --> 01:20:14,705
Hello dear.

1023
01:20:14,706 --> 01:20:16,356
There is somebody waiting
for you in the den.

1024
01:20:18,957 --> 01:20:19,710
General!

1025
01:20:22,325 --> 01:20:23,276
Edward.

1026
01:20:25,483 --> 01:20:27,105
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this.

1027
01:20:27,106 --> 01:20:28,668
You wife kindly helped me to a drink.

1028
01:20:30,865 --> 01:20:31,623
My feet!

1029
01:20:31,624 --> 01:20:33,162
I keep cutting off pieces of them.

1030
01:20:33,992 --> 01:20:36,270
It's not dignified for a man
to have to die from the feet up.

1031
01:20:43,042 --> 01:20:46,291
Well, while everybody has been
feeling good about themselves

1032
01:20:46,292 --> 01:20:49,594
the Soviets, without firing a shot
have taken over half the World.

1033
01:20:50,043 --> 01:20:51,400
They're breathing down our necks.

1034
01:20:51,689 --> 01:20:53,389
They'll be in our back
yard before you know it.

1035
01:20:53,884 --> 01:20:55,031
So I've been telling the President

1036
01:20:55,196 --> 01:20:57,764
about our need to create a
foreign intelligence service

1037
01:20:57,765 --> 01:21:00,264
one that will do in peace time what
it was asked to do during the war.

1038
01:21:01,455 --> 01:21:03,446
Phillip Allen will be heading the agency

1039
01:21:03,447 --> 01:21:04,822
Richard Hayes will be his exec

1040
01:21:04,857 --> 01:21:06,595
and you'll be taking division C.

1041
01:21:06,596 --> 01:21:09,241
Special operations that
report only to the director.

1042
01:21:10,026 --> 01:21:11,767
It will be limited to overseas, obviously.

1043
01:21:11,768 --> 01:21:13,536
Subversive operations,

1044
01:21:13,537 --> 01:21:15,359
intelligence gathering and analysis.

1045
01:21:16,117 --> 01:21:18,660
And I'd be interested in
your thoughts about this.

1046
01:21:20,078 --> 01:21:23,660
Particularly, in your area of
expertise. Counter intelligence.

1047
01:21:23,773 --> 01:21:25,882
I'd be glad to help in any way I can.

1048
01:21:26,489 --> 01:21:27,127
That's all right.

1049
01:21:27,322 --> 01:21:29,481
Edward. Go outside.

1050
01:21:30,826 --> 01:21:31,857
Excuse me sir.

1051
01:21:32,045 --> 01:21:33,005
Margaret.

1052
01:21:42,466 --> 01:21:43,602
Thank you.

1053
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:56,953
I have to tell you, I have some
real problems with this whole thing.

1054
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:57,954
Despite how much we need it.

1055
01:21:59,598 --> 01:22:02,709
I'm concerned that too much power
will end up in the hands of too few.

1056
01:22:03,288 --> 01:22:06,894
It's always in someone's best interest
to promote enemies, real or imagined.

1057
01:22:07,202 --> 01:22:09,447
I see this as America's eyes and ears.

1058
01:22:09,448 --> 01:22:11,932
I don't want it to become
it's heart and soul.

1059
01:22:13,832 --> 01:22:15,816
So I told the President,
for this to work

1060
01:22:15,817 --> 01:22:18,560
they’re going to have to be some
kind of civilian oversight.

1061
01:22:18,889 --> 01:22:19,901
Oversight?

1062
01:22:21,576 --> 01:22:23,624
How can you have a covert organization

1063
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:25,129
if you have people
looking over your shoulder?

1064
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:27,045
You know who gave Hitler his power?

1065
01:22:27,219 --> 01:22:28,757
The clerks and the book keepers.

1066
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:30,802
The civil servants.

1067
01:22:31,936 --> 01:22:33,742
I have this one weakness.

1068
01:22:34,685 --> 01:22:35,852
I believe in a just God.

1069
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:39,624
I always seem to err on
the side of democracy.

1070
01:22:46,551 --> 01:22:48,807
This must be a nice
place to raise a family.

1071
01:22:50,119 --> 01:22:51,040
I never had the time.

1072
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:53,952
I'll be dead in less than a year.

1073
01:22:57,215 --> 01:22:58,566
I love this country.

1074
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:01,862
We all do sir. We all do.

1075
01:23:11,877 --> 01:23:13,472
No matter what anyone tells you,

1076
01:23:13,526 --> 01:23:14,960
there'll be no one you can really trust.

1077
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:22,352
I'm afraid when it's all said and
done we're all just clerks too.

1078
01:23:44,142 --> 01:23:45,567
I was under the impression that

1079
01:23:45,602 --> 01:23:47,689
Dr. Ibanez supported a democracy.

1080
01:23:47,896 --> 01:23:49,574
I'm afraid he's changed his mind.

1081
01:23:50,164 --> 01:23:52,501
The doctor started to
believe his own propaganda.

1082
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,295
I mean you dream this guy, Edward.

1083
01:23:54,296 --> 01:23:55,296
Help, get him elected.

1084
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:56,577
Those are the Soviets

1085
01:23:56,612 --> 01:23:58,921
International Department
of Central Committee members

1086
01:23:58,922 --> 01:23:59,922
Trudnikov and Kosholnikov.

1087
01:24:01,887 --> 01:24:04,671
that have become overly interested
in their natural resources

1088
01:24:04,752 --> 01:24:05,752
particularly coffee.

1089
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:10,404
Our economic interests
have become compromised.

1090
01:24:11,211 --> 01:24:14,706
To say nothing of the dangers of
a Soviet presence so close to home.

1091
01:24:16,741 --> 01:24:19,750
For security ????? we must
establish our own presence there.

1092
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:22,327
Stop!

1093
01:24:22,328 --> 01:24:23,328
Can you go back.

1094
01:24:23,996 --> 01:24:25,675
Go. Go back a little bit.

1095
01:24:29,233 --> 01:24:30,384
Run it from there.

1096
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:47,251
I just thought I saw something.

1097
01:24:47,695 --> 01:24:50,008
I want you two to put your
heads together on this.

1098
01:24:50,733 --> 01:24:52,123
Michael will be going down there

1099
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:53,826
as an agricultural specialist

1100
01:24:53,827 --> 01:24:55,773
with the Mayan Coffee Company

1101
01:24:55,816 --> 01:24:56,557
non official

1102
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,189
He'll be our eyes and ears.

1103
01:25:00,222 --> 01:25:00,908
Congratulations.

1104
01:25:00,947 --> 01:25:01,375
Thank you sir.

1105
01:25:02,606 --> 01:25:03,216
Good luck.

1106
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,098
Thank you.

1107
01:25:04,904 --> 01:25:06,375
I wouldn't wear my
class ring down there.

1108
01:25:07,244 --> 01:25:08,424
Yes sir. Of course.

1109
01:25:08,425 --> 01:25:10,317
I want all intelligence on this

1110
01:25:10,322 --> 01:25:12,526
sent directly to me and no one else.

1111
01:25:16,414 --> 01:25:17,988
I believe that's what
you're looking for.

1112
01:25:20,505 --> 01:25:21,699
That'll do it.
