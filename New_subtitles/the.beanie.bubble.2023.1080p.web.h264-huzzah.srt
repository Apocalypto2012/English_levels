1
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,176
<i>How did it all start?</i>

2
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,722
<i>I mean,
my girls inspired the first Beanies.</i>

3
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,652
<i>I was employee number 12.</i>

4
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:14,449
<i>Three years later, we were the most
profitable toy company in the world.</i>

5
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:28,505
<i>Ty would tell you
he did it all, but that's bullshit.</i>

6
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:32,009
<i>We built that company together.</i>

7
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,178
<i>From nothing.</i>

8
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,352
<i>I mean, that's the whole point of America,
right?</i>

9
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:48,065
<i>Work hard. Build something good.</i>

10
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:53,947
<i>Get yourself in the right place
at the right time, and boom.</i>

11
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,145
{\an8}<i>We didn't set out
to make America lose its mind,</i>

12
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,190
<i>but that's what happened.</i>

13
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,780
<i>Was it crazy
to turn stuffed animals into investments?</i>

14
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,291
<i>It was a crazy time.</i>

15
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,505
<i>The Internet was new.
The Boomers were taking over.</i>

16
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:20,344
<i>But we turned Beanie Babies
into little plush lotto tickets.</i>

17
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,098
<i>At the peak of the bubble,
more than half the country owned one.</i>

18
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:30,562
<i>Ty was the one with his name on the tag.
The one who made billions.</i>

19
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,649
<i>But he couldn't have done it
without the three of us.</i>

20
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,778
<i>- He didn't do it without the three of us.</i>
- Ty!

21
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,696
<i>So this story's not about him.</i>

22
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,823
<i>It's about us.</i>

23
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,798
<i>I met Ty back in the '80s</i>

24
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,093
<i>when we were living
in the same apartment building.</i>

25
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,139
Oh, God, not my husband!

26
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,060
- Ma'am, I need you to just back up, okay?
- Oh, my God. Is this Billy?

27
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,813
<i>When his dad died.</i>

28
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,318
Oh, shit.

29
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,451
Billy,

30
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,663
did you take your meds?

31
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,458
Did you take your meds today?

32
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,960
Yeah.

33
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,629
Did you pick up more Tab?

34
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,841
Yeah.

35
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,453
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry for your loss.

36
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:13,748
I baked this.

37
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,918
- Here, I'll just put it down for you.
- Yeah. Okay.

38
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,295
Yeah, it's a lasagna. Maybe just here?

39
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,425
I'm not psycho.

40
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,555
I dissect them
to see how they're made for work.

41
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:32,476
Not for fun.
But to be honest, it is pretty fun.

42
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,102
Right.

43
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,773
My dad would say,
"You gotta make your own luck.

44
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:42,528
You can't wait for your ship to come in,
Son. You gotta build your own ship."

45
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:44,154
That's what he would say.

46
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,866
- Have you told your mom yet?
- Oh, God, no.

47
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:53,205
She is a violent paranoid schizophrenic
who abandoned us years ago.

48
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,667
Where was your dad for all this?

49
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,669
On the road, selling toys.

50
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,796
Oh, man.

51
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,257
It's okay. Was better that way.

52
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:06,635
Otherwise he would be at home,
beating the crap out of me.

53
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,137
Wait. I...

54
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,308
- I thought you two were so close.
- No.

55
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,813
The only time my dad was proud of me

56
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,860
is when our girlfriend told him
how good I was in bed.

57
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,615
- "Our girlfriend."
- Yeah, the same woman.

58
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,617
- You dated the same woman?
- No.

59
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:31,951
- At the same time?
- No, not...

60
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,998
- No, not always at the same time, no.
- Okay.

61
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,332
We're gonna need another.

62
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:43,255
I do and do not want to know
much, much more.

63
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,931
<i>My story started ten years later,</i>

64
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,185
<i>when I first
walked into the offices of Ty Inc.</i>

65
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,151
<i>I was a 17-year-old college
freshman just trying to land a temp job.</i>

66
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,571
<i>Not usher in a new era of capitalism.</i>

67
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,284
You'd be expected to brush
and tweeze the display cats.

68
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,122
- Oh, wow. You're serious.
- Yeah.

69
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:22,377
But the job's mainly the phones.
Four hours a day, plus some Saturdays.

70
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,128
You said you're in school?

71
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,923
- Yeah, I'm in school...
<i>- Roberta, sweetie,</i>

72
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,760
<i>you need to come tell me
which one of these looks like marigold.</i>

73
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,347
You pressed "Intercom All" again. And no.

74
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:36,975
Bye.

75
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,898
Yeah, I'm in school,
but the schedule's not a problem.

76
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:44,650
I just need money.

77
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,735
Tuition's tough these days, huh?

78
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,238
I've got a scholarship. It's for rent.

79
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:53,825
If I keep living at home,
my soul will soon be fully crushed.

80
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,746
We pay minimum wage.
Not sure that's a salvation salary.

81
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:59,414
You don't know how cheap my soul is.

82
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,627
We do what we gotta do, right?

83
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,338
This just pays my bungee bills.

84
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,133
Oh, Robbie, I need you. Robbie?

85
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,426
Rose, which color is better?

86
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,867
- Don't know, don't care.
- What about you? What do you think?

87
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,973
I'm not really a cat person.

88
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,142
Are you an amazing things person?

89
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,773
Yeah, I wouldn't go yellow at all.
Too mild.

90
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,442
These little punks wanna be tiger-striped.

91
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,945
But wouldn't stripes make them
too convict-y?

92
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,408
Well, cats are outlaws.
Convict-y is kinda their appeal.

93
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:35,492
Yes.

94
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,538
Rose, she has a good point. What...

95
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,416
Rose, what are you looking at?

96
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,128
<i>We'll get to that later.</i>

97
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:47,880
Don't go anywhere.

98
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,718
Does that mean I'm hired?

99
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,885
<i>It did.</i>

100
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:57,097
<i>But obviously none of this
would have happened without Sheila.</i>

101
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,875
<i>Mr. President and Mrs. Clinton,</i>

102
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:07,983
<i>and Americans everywhere.</i>

103
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:13,529
<i>A Rock, A River, A Tree Hosts...</i>

104
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,867
<i>It certainly wasn't my dream
designing lights for people like Ty.</i>

105
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,829
<i>I did it to pay the bills,
to support my girls.</i>

106
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:26,502
Well, I've been waiting since 9:00.
Does he need to reschedule?

107
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,963
Honestly, if I were you, I'd just bail.

108
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,510
<i>I wanted the world to be better for them.</i>

109
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:39,556
<i>I wanted it to get kinder and happier
and more human.</i>

110
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,726
<i>I wanted it to hurry up.</i>

111
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,821
Lights, right? I'll be right with ya.

112
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,824
<i>The UK is a mess, and it's not my fault.</i>

113
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,620
And the last thing I would do
is to hire incompetent partners...

114
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,206
Excuse me, what are you doing?

115
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,125
Do you often keep people waiting
three hours?

116
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,584
It has been a hectic...

117
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,129
'Cause I told my sick daughters
I'd be back as quick as I could,

118
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,213
and then I waited here

119
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:14,090
- for longer than a human should...
- I run a company

120
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,635
- that's highly unpredictable...
- Okay. I know you're busy.

121
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,135
And I know you're rich.

122
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,076
But I also know that life is too short
to waste on assholes,

123
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:24,017
so please move your car,
or I'll move it for you less gently.

124
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:25,435
I got better places to be.

125
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:28,689
Wow.

126
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,400
May I come?

127
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,902
I am not joking.

128
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,115
I am so sorry. Let me make it up to you.
Let me take you to dinner.

129
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:40,284
No. I only eat dinner with my daughters.

130
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,662
Well, I'll take all of you.
It'll be fun. Kids love me.

131
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,416
Look, this isn't personal. I...

132
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,750
Despite what I said
about you being an asshole...

133
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:53,297
Assholes used to be my type.
I just... I don't date anymore.

134
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,174
Anyone? Ever?

135
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,302
No. Not till my girls grow up.

136
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:00,804
Goodbye.

137
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,431
Okay.

138
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,059
- Your loss.
- Okay.

139
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,562
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

140
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,110
Mommy, when is it gonna warm up?

141
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,739
That is a great question. You know what?

142
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,494
Soon.

143
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:25,995
And if it doesn't,

144
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,082
we're gonna go to Uncle Jeremy's,
stay the night there.

145
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,043
He's not really our uncle.

146
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,838
No, but he really is a Jeremy. I think.

147
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,759
- We got it!
- Hang on, girls.

148
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,845
- Are you Sheila Harper's daughters?
- Yeah. Who's asking?

149
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,724
This is from Mr. Ty Warner.
He hopes that they're feeling better.

150
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:47,643
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

151
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:48,935
- Thanks!
- Hang on.

152
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:51,605
- What is it?
- I don't know. Let's find out.

153
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:52,981
Let's get the door.

154
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,859
All right. Hang on, hang on.

155
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,695
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh!

156
00:12:58,696 --> 00:12:59,820
Oh, my God.

157
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,241
<i>Ty was good at knowing what people wanted.</i>

158
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:04,076
Wow, look at all of this.

159
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,090
<i>First,
I wanted to be a wide receiver in the NFL.</i>

160
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,345
Then I wanted to star in air shows.
I stole a crop plane to practice.

161
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:27,307
Then I wanted to beat up Sam Walton.

162
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:28,683
The Walmart guy?

163
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,582
Walmart puts family stores
out of business.

164
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,481
- Well, I think you could take him.
- Duh.

165
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,443
Damn it,
I had so many plans back in Arkansas.

166
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,072
Life was gonna be so fun
if I just got out into it.

167
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,740
Like, I left...

168
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,911
I left so that I wouldn't get stuck
taking care of people.

169
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,540
I wanted to live my life for me.

170
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,503
And here I am. This tub.

171
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,504
Look at this.

172
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:02,426
- It's like I'm my mother.
- Dad was hiding the good stuff.

173
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,136
I like good stuff.

174
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,222
- Scotch. Yeah.
- Me. Oh, yeah, yeah.

175
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,226
So graceful.

176
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,438
We should be synchronized swimmers!

177
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,858
- From now on.
- Robbie, Robbie.

178
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:19,442
Listen to me.

179
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,945
You can do anything you want.
You're not stuck.

180
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,156
You're tough, and you're strong.

181
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,659
Let's start our own business, you and me.

182
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,288
A synchronized swimming business?

183
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,418
A stuffed Himalayan cat business.

184
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:44,009
A synchronized stuffed Himalayan
swimming business?

185
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,053
- I'm serious. Well...
- Robbie!

186
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,182
- Robbie, is that you?
- No!

187
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,117
What?

188
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,120
How are you even walking?

189
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:19,878
I sold all my dad's antiques
so we could start

190
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:23,298
our own business together.

191
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,386
The swimming thing?

192
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:31,430
The cats. Yeah, the stuffed cats.

193
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,932
Don't you understand? This is happening.

194
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,936
This is the first day of
the rest of your life, young lady.

195
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:37,687
Could you just take it down a little bit?

196
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:40,065
This is the first day of
the rest of your life.

197
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,738
Here we are.

198
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,658
- Okay. For you.
- Wow.

199
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,786
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

200
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,707
For you. It's hot. Hot, hot.

201
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,500
And I like mine cold.

202
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,670
You know,
we were supposed to be treating you.

203
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:03,588
Mr. Warner, this is very kind.

204
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:07,341
Please, it's Ty. Mr. Warner was my dad.

205
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,178
And his stuffed animals
weren't as cool as mine.

206
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:10,386
Yours are so cool.

207
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,222
Yours are the bestest best.

208
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,184
Thank you very much.
Do you have a favorite?

209
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:16,267
The pig.

210
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,393
And the frog.

211
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,396
I tried to bring it to school
for show-and-tell,

212
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:21,148
but it wouldn't fit in my backpack.

213
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:22,232
Oh, no.

214
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,989
Well, I'm gonna have to
make a smaller one then.

215
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,988
And maybe a little softer too.

216
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,992
- Okay, let's stick to the thank-yous.
- Softer. Okay.

217
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:33,410
- Hey, Ty?
- Yes, ma'am.

218
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,205
Do you wanna go roller-skating
with us sometime?

219
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,290
- I would love to.
- Honey, no. Okay.

220
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,042
- I would love to.
- Can we, Mommy? Soon?

221
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,793
Okay... Well, I mean, Ty's a busy man,

222
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:46,256
- so I don't know when he would find time.
- Listen, let's...

223
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:48,696
- let's keep your mom out of this, okay?
- Okay.

224
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:51,136
I'll have my people contact your people.
How's that?

225
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,232
Ben, 9 and 11.

226
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,776
- Thank you.
- Your left hands.

227
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:09,238
- I declare a thumb war.
- Ladies.

228
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:11,114
- Hi.
- Hey. There you are.

229
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,198
- Hi.
- Hi, Ty.

230
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,577
I have been looking forward to this
all week.

231
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:20,789
And I brought a surprise.

232
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,000
- Oh, my God. Froggy!
- It's a Beanie Baby.

233
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,336
That's a miniature version
of your favorite.

234
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,673
- I know.
- He's small enough to go everywhere,

235
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:30,259
and he loves to ride in backpacks.

236
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,845
Wow, then you can take him to school.

237
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:34,095
What's his name?

238
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,473
I don't know yet.
What does he look like to you?

239
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,476
Can I take a closer look at him?

240
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,646
What do you think he looks like?

241
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:44,919
- Greenie.
- Greenie.

242
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,191
Kids' 11 and 13, Sheila.

243
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,152
- Yeah. That's us.
- Can you give us a minute?

244
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:50,320
We're working here.

245
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,322
All right.

246
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:58,078
Why don't we name him Mar?

247
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,330
- Mar?
- Yeah.

248
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,794
I mean, Leaper's a great name.
I'm just not sold on it yet, but it's...

249
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,337
What about Sir Jumps-a-Lot?

250
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,860
That's a good one.

251
00:18:09,861 --> 00:18:11,717
Or maybe, like, Jumpy?

252
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,636
- That's too on the nose, Jumpy.
- Jumpy.

253
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:17,264
I dance with my arms.
I dance with my head.

254
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:20,016
I dance with my butt.
I dance with my belly.

255
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:22,769
I dance with my legs.
I dance with my arms.

256
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,271
I dance with my belly.

257
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,940
- Well, that's it.
- What?

258
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,275
- Legs.
- What?

259
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:29,567
Legs.

260
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:30,651
- The name?
- What?

261
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:33,070
- That's great. Legs.
- That's the name.

262
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,489
- Legs the frog. I named it!
- Legs!

263
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,826
- We have a name.
- Good work, ladies. Great.

264
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,076
And I think

265
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,621
- Legs has a friend.
- Oh, my gosh.

266
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:44,166
We'll go roller-skating eventually.

267
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,085
No, I think we're having a great time.

268
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,026
Yeah, okay. Talk to you later.

269
00:18:51,027 --> 00:18:52,381
<i>Within a few months,</i>

270
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:56,345
<i>Ty was completely obsessed
with his new Beanie Baby line.</i>

271
00:18:56,346 --> 00:18:58,430
<i>And working there was actually fun...</i>

272
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,347
- Hey.
- Hey.

273
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:02,142
<i>...'cause if he liked the way you think,
he'd listen to you.</i>

274
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:03,685
- Hey.
<i>- No matter who you were.</i>

275
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,605
<i>Case in point: his design team.</i>

276
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,482
Hey, Ty. Like my ghost?

277
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,693
- It's fantastic.
- Thank you.

278
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,366
- First batch of puppies is here.
- Yeah.

279
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,703
- Look at them.
- Cute.

280
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:23,496
So cute! The face.

281
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,290
Let them hug. Let's hug.

282
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,083
I see you named him Dots.

283
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,336
Oh, yeah. After much deliberation.

284
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:30,837
Well, I dig it.

285
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:33,507
It's just... Don't you think
he should actually have some dots?

286
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:34,675
It's a she.

287
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:36,426
I'm sorry.

288
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,345
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

289
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:43,058
Well, you know what?
She definitely should have some dots.

290
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:44,726
Maya's right, as usual.

291
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:50,148
All right, ladies. For the next batch,
where should we put Dots's dots?

292
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:51,232
On her butt!

293
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,317
On the butt?

294
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,654
- How many dots on the butt?
- A million.

295
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:57,781
- A million dots?
- A million dots.

296
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:06,498
<i>When Ty's Beanie Babies
were ready for their world debut,</i>

297
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:09,084
<i>he put me in charge of
smaller trade shows.</i>

298
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,379
<i>'Cause I rocked at selling stuff.</i>

299
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,008
<i>I killed it.</i>

300
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,719
<i>- I raked in the orders.</i>
- So soft.

301
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,431
<i>For everything except Beanies.</i>

302
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,642
<i>Their big launch was a total flop.</i>

303
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,937
<i>For two years,
we couldn't sell any at all.</i>

304
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:31,106
<i>It drove Ty crazy.</i>

305
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,441
What is this, a comic book stand?

306
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:36,111
No, Ty Inc. is all about
high-quality stuffed animals.

307
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:37,738
None of them are looking at me.

308
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:38,946
What?

309
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:42,242
These animals are supposed to be
making tantalizing eye contact with me.

310
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,911
They're supposed to be alluringly tweezed.

311
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,621
Yeah, you should go blond more often, Ty.

312
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:49,208
- It really brings out your cheekbones.
- I'm undercover.

313
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,626
- Why aren't you wearing something sparkly?
- This is my version of sparkly.

314
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,005
How are sales?

315
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,591
Good. Well, except for Beanies.

316
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:01,094
Though there have been
a lot of requests for Woolly.

317
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:03,846
Maya,
if you can't sell what we actually have,

318
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:07,768
I'm gonna have to find someone that can.
Someone a little bit more focused.

319
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:14,399
Hi. I'd like my regular order,
plus a batch of those cheap little lambs.

320
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,235
Do you still have those?

321
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:21,823
That design has been retired.
That was a special limited edition.

322
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,534
- A what?
- A limited edition.

323
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:27,328
If you still have some,
they're pretty valuable.

324
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:31,041
You know, the first issue of <i>Action Comics</i>
sells for over a million dollars.

325
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:35,920
Are any of these others,
limited editions too?

326
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:39,466
Yep. All the Beanie Babies are.
Be a good idea to stock up.

327
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,885
{\an8}Okay. Put me down for five of each.

328
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:42,969
{\an8}Frank Carlson.

329
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,973
Uncle Frank's Toys in Glenview, I know.
I got you.

330
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:47,057
Thank you.

331
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:54,940
- "Retired." That's genius.
- Limited editions always get people.

332
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:56,899
I love it. It's fantastic.

333
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,819
Get this comic book off the table, please.

334
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:04,825
So you're being an assistant
to some man selling worthless toys,

335
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:06,994
instead of studying full-time
to be a surgeon?

336
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:08,995
- Yep.
- Fascinating.

337
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,288
After we sacrificed so much

338
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,624
to come to a country
where women can do anything they want.

339
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,543
Exactly.
Anything they want, not their parents.

340
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:18,442
- And I'm still in school, don't freak.
- Do I look like a freaker?

341
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:21,341
- I mean, you do kind of freak out...
- Not a word from you, mister.

342
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:23,864
Okay, come on.
I don't have all day to help my daughter

343
00:22:23,865 --> 00:22:26,387
shatter her parents' hearts
into a thousand tiny pieces.

344
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:31,393
- My new place is a mile away, Dad.
- 1,000 tiny, irreparable pieces.

345
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,188
So dramatic.

346
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,882
You wanna sell
high-end stuffed Himalayan cats?

347
00:22:41,883 --> 00:22:45,031
Understuffed, actually.
For greater posability.

348
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:48,076
It's a revolutionary new design
that's going to electrify the market.

349
00:22:48,077 --> 00:22:51,038
I assume you're aware
that the current economic conditions

350
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,164
{\an8}are crippling stagnation,

351
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:56,125
<i>soaring inflation and record unemployment.</i>

352
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:59,713
Which makes this the perfect time
to sell a little joy.

353
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:03,675
We're professionals.
We're giving the people what they need.

354
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:10,849
I'll draw up the paperwork.

355
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:16,772
<i>And just like that, Ty Inc. was born.</i>

356
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,066
- See here?
- Yeah.

357
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,903
- The threading is not...
- Well, you can see it right there.

358
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:25,404
Now, this is what we call the... stitch.

359
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,844
<i>Ty taught me everything
about stuffed animals,</i>

360
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:30,285
<i>which hadn't changed much in 50 years.</i>

361
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:34,081
<i>They'd been made pretty firm,
stuffed to the seams.</i>

362
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:38,126
<i>His big idea? Make 'em softer. Posable.</i>

363
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:39,627
This is, like, a old lady and...

364
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:42,381
<i>I was a fast learner.
And I had a thing or two to teach him.</i>

365
00:23:42,382 --> 00:23:43,923
- It's so boring.
- This one works.

366
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:47,177
- Look at this. Look at this. That's it.
- Doesn't work.

367
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:49,888
Open, open. Hurry. hurry.

368
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:51,557
<i>We were a good team.</i>

369
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:52,641
It's good.

370
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,019
It's good! I love it!

371
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,354
Robbie! Hey!

372
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,524
<i>Turns out I was born for this shit.</i>

373
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:01,942
{\an8}Yeah, I hear you!

374
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,695
{\an8}Robbie! Hey, Robbie!

375
00:24:04,696 --> 00:24:06,654
{\an8}J... One sec!

376
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:11,243
One. One each. Oh, my God. One.

377
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:15,789
Who knew it only took
inventing a line of stuffed animals

378
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,875
to break your strict dating embargo?

379
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:22,316
- It took way more than that.
- Did it?

380
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:25,382
Yeah.
And they're understuffed, by the way.

381
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,218
One of his many innovations.

382
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,389
You seem kinda happy.

383
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,184
I don't know, Ty's different. He's...

384
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:41,273
He's strange and magical,
and the girls, they love him.

385
00:24:41,274 --> 00:24:43,108
And you?

386
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:45,194
They love me too.

387
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:49,614
Wow.

388
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:52,492
- Is that the one she designed?
- Yeah. I brought you one.

389
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:55,579
- Here.
- Look at this.

390
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,248
{\an8}It's got her name in it.

391
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,168
Look at his cute little dots!

392
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:02,669
Oh, my goodness.

393
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:05,714
- These are adorable.
- Our friend, Ty, makes them.

394
00:25:05,715 --> 00:25:06,798
I designed Spooky.

395
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,090
Really?

396
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:09,091
- Yeah.
- Wow.

397
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:13,931
Little poems inside their tags.

398
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,141
How darling.

399
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,268
Girls.

400
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:26,151
<i>Our little world
was getting better and happier.</i>

401
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,198
<i>Before we knew it, we were a family.</i>

402
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:35,202
<i>A funny, weird, happy family.</i>

403
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,168
You a doctor yet?

404
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,712
It's so boring.

405
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:48,465
If it weren't for computer science,
I'd kill myself.

406
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:52,594
Good news is, Stripes turned out great.
Wanna hear?

407
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:53,928
Nope.

408
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:56,138
<i>My name is Stripes
And I'm fun to snuggle</i>

409
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,641
<i>I was born too soft
For the jungle struggle</i>

410
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,143
<i>So, I packed my bags, waved goodbye</i>

411
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,479
<i>And came to live with my friends at Ty</i>

412
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,442
I still can't believe
Ty let you print raps on their tags.

413
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:09,486
Poems, Rose. This is poetry.

414
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:10,571
Uh-huh.

415
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,282
Stripes has a birthday coming up.
Should we blow it out?

416
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:18,328
You're doing something right.
Regional Beanie sales are way up.

417
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:19,997
For real?

418
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:23,876
No "piggity"?

419
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:28,088
If you start with puns,
I might actually have to punch you.

420
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,340
All right.

421
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,551
My bat.

422
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:35,761
- Bird up!
- Okay.

423
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,390
No, come on. I'm just kitten around.

424
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:39,474
All right.

425
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:41,685
Watch out.

426
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:43,604
What the fox?

427
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,442
Hey. This is unbearable.

428
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:55,866
<i>The local surge had started
in a small suburban neighborhood</i>

429
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:58,785
<i>outside of Chicago,
just after the holidays.</i>

430
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:04,166
<i>Some kids who'd gotten Beanies brought
them to school and showed them off.</i>

431
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:08,337
<i>It wasn't long before
some parents got pretty into them too.</i>

432
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:11,632
<i>Three of them
lived on the same cul-de-sac.</i>

433
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:13,509
<i>Two were named Linda.</i>

434
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:17,137
<i>All of them started Beanie hunting
at the local toy store.</i>

435
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:22,267
<i>Frank even published a checklist,
which brought out the crazy.</i>

436
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:26,438
<i>'Cause once you have a checklist,
it's no longer about what you have.</i>

437
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,316
<i>It's all about what you don't have.</i>

438
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,491
<i>Initially, the regional boom
was all word of mouth,</i>

439
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,826
<i>'cause Ty didn't buy TV ads.</i>

440
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:44,164
<i>But word of mouth was about to get
a hell of a megaphone.</i>

441
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:48,168
In summary,
the Midwest market is going bananas.

442
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:52,672
Hey.

443
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:54,423
Bravo. Exciting.

444
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,800
- Exciting, right?
- Yes.

445
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:58,846
Hey, did you get a chance to check out
that modem I left for you yet?

446
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:00,179
- The what-em?
- Modem.

447
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,559
That little computer box I put in your
office that connects you to the Internet?

448
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,603
All of these messages
are about Beanie Babies?

449
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:08,813
This whole section is Beanie Baby boards.

450
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:10,983
Everyone writing on here
is writing about them.

451
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:14,862
But how do they all know each other?

452
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:19,616
Well, they don't.
It's kinda like a big conference call.

453
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:22,494
We're dialed into this thing
called America Online,

454
00:28:22,495 --> 00:28:24,037
and so is everyone else here.

455
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,039
Can we go back to the chat pad thing?

456
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,124
Chat room.

457
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,208
Okay.

458
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,222
- It's so fast.
- Right?

459
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:45,871
- Look at that. There's new thingies.
- Yeah. All the time.

460
00:28:45,872 --> 00:28:48,729
We're just watching Beanie lovers
hang out in real time.

461
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:52,941
Even if they're in different
cities, time zones. Wherever.

462
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:55,526
How many people
are into this sort of thing overall?

463
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:59,323
My professor says 18 million homes
now have modem-equipped computers,

464
00:28:59,324 --> 00:29:01,158
- up from 11 million a year ago...
- What?

465
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:02,992
...and that number's gonna keep growing.

466
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:05,621
Wow, 18 million people
just talking about Beanie Babies.

467
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:08,039
Well, and other things.

468
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,585
I mean, the Internet's a whole new way of
connecting to the rest of the world.

469
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:12,669
It's amazing.

470
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,589
We really should start a Ty web page.

471
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:17,173
What's that?

472
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:18,257
We can make a place

473
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:21,678
that anyone who wants to know
anything about Beanie Babies can go to.

474
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,597
A place we control.

475
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:26,140
Completely?

476
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:29,269
And we'd probably be the first business
to make one for our customers,

477
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,103
'cause no one else is using it that way.

478
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:35,067
Most web pages are just boring academic
stuff and phone directories,

479
00:29:35,068 --> 00:29:36,735
but we could make ours fun.

480
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:39,696
Different. Sparkly.

481
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,032
Sparkly, I like that.

482
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:46,203
- Wait. Your version of sparkly or mine?
- Yours.

483
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,625
Are these toy shindigs fancy?

484
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:57,089
Ty says we have to put on a show
and "pack something flashy," so...

485
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,636
Is he gonna wear a dress also or does
he not do that sort of thing in public?

486
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:04,428
He is not a cross-dresser.

487
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:07,557
Yeah, well, he is the kinda guy
who's hiding who he really is.

488
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,686
Ty had a rough life too, you know,
but he's going after things.

489
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:13,397
He's making things happen,
getting what he deserves.

490
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:16,567
- It's inspiring.
- Uh-huh.

491
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:22,072
For once, I feel like I'm being
pulled up, not just dragged down.

492
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:23,907
It's a fucking miracle.

493
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:30,414
- I didn't mean... I meant work stuff.
- It's fine. It's fine.

494
00:30:30,415 --> 00:30:31,999
You're allowed to go have fun.

495
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:40,716
It's nice feeling
like someone believes in me.

496
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:43,969
That's all I meant.

497
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:47,723
Well, you'll have to tell me
what that feels like.

498
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:54,041
I made you a lasagna,
and there's pizza too.

499
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:56,690
And I'll only be gone for two days. Okay?

500
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:59,150
- Make it longer.
- You know what, Billy?

501
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,695
- I'm fucking trying to do s...
- No. I'm serious, okay?

502
00:31:01,696 --> 00:31:04,239
Let's stop fucking pretending.
I'm sick of it.

503
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:07,618
You're not the only one
who's feeling fucking suffocated.

504
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:22,361
- Checking in?
- Yes. Roberta Jones.

505
00:31:22,362 --> 00:31:24,676
- I'm... The toy convention?
- Welcome.

506
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,431
Here's your keys.

507
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:31,891
And Mr. Warner left you a note.

508
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:35,395
He said to tell you he's "fetching
a chariot to collect you at 3:00."

509
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:37,022
And he left you this.

510
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,677
Give them a look and give them a try.

511
00:32:28,678 --> 00:32:30,982
There you go. What do you think? Not bad?

512
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:33,287
- Let me grab that from you.
- Not bad.

513
00:32:33,288 --> 00:32:34,745
That's great.

514
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:37,291
- This is not your dad's stuffed animal.
- Enjoy your day.

515
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:41,253
Fifty-two poses for the head alone.

516
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:50,304
Thirty fucking thousand dollars!

517
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,224
In an hour! For stuffed cats!

518
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,977
We are great together,
just like I said we would be.

519
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:00,731
- Fucking great.
- Ship-building champs, we are!

520
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:03,692
Motherfucking Vikings!

521
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:05,194
Hotel, please.

522
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:09,448
You're one in a million, Robbie Jones.

523
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,491
You are.

524
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:55,744
Oh, God.

525
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:07,798
Do you know what the greatest thing
about America is?

526
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,049
- Toys!
- Milkshakes!

527
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,679
Well, that's number... Yes.
Number seven and 14, of course.

528
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,472
But the number one
greatest thing about America?

529
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:21,103
It's the land of comebacks,
of new chances, of opportunity.

530
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:25,065
You can make things happen here
like nowhere else, ladies.

531
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:26,774
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

532
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:32,447
And never forget that you
have the power to create your own future.

533
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:35,741
Never forget that you can be anything,

534
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:38,579
- you can do anything.
- I'm gonna be a unicorn!

535
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,163
You already are, darling. You already are.

536
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:46,210
The past few years have been
just the greatest ever.

537
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:50,257
I think we make an unbeatable team.
I think we do.

538
00:34:50,258 --> 00:34:51,800
- We make an unbeatable team.
- Yeah.

539
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:53,844
- Me too.
- Me three.

540
00:34:53,845 --> 00:34:54,928
Me four.

541
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:59,725
And I think some really amazing things...
You ready?

542
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:03,812
I think some amazing things
are getting ready to happen.

543
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:05,689
Can we do it now?

544
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:07,608
Ladies.

545
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,195
What is happening?

546
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:14,635
<i>Oh, oh</i>

547
00:35:14,636 --> 00:35:17,326
What?

548
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:22,455
<i>Oh Oh, Sheila</i>

549
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:24,750
<i>Let me love you till the morning comes</i>

550
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:26,667
Oh, my...

551
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:30,004
<i>Oh Oh, Sheila</i>

552
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:32,716
<i>You know I want to be the only one</i>

553
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:37,345
<i>Oh, baby, love me right</i>

554
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:39,640
<i>Let me love you till we get it right</i>

555
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:44,977
<i>Why can't you let the others be?</i>

556
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:48,899
<i>'Cause with you is where I wanna be Yeah</i>

557
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,109
<i>Oh Oh, Sheila</i>

558
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,906
<i>Let me love you till the morning comes
Oh, Sheila</i>

559
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:59,534
<i>Oh Oh, Sheila</i>

560
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:03,288
<i>You know I want to be the only one
Oh, Sheila</i>

561
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:05,415
<i>- Here we go</i>
- Oh, my God.

562
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,045
Sheila Marie Harper,
will you make me the happiest man alive?

563
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,880
Say yes!

564
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:15,634
Yes. Of course.

565
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:16,802
Mommy!

566
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:19,805
She said yes!

567
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:20,889
Yay!

568
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:37,406
You know, I thought it was just gonna be
me and the girls till they left home.

569
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:40,784
Man, did you screw with my plans.

570
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:46,039
Well, get ready for me to screw
with your plans for the rest of our lives.

571
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:53,714
You know, this is serious,
what we're doing.

572
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:00,137
- You're not reconsidering, are you?
- No.

573
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:03,015
No. No, sweetheart.

574
00:37:03,016 --> 00:37:05,726
I just...

575
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:12,316
In the past, I have relied on men,

576
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:15,277
and they turned out to be the wrong men.

577
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:20,657
I would die before I let you down.

578
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:32,043
You know, I don't need this.

579
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:35,172
I don't need to get married.

580
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,591
Well, I do.

581
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,431
- You feel that, right?
- Yeah.

582
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:49,895
Your face-lift scar
from just before we met.

583
00:37:49,896 --> 00:37:52,356
'Cause I was ready for a fresh start.

584
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:53,565
Wow.

585
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:57,778
You know, I never knew
that plastic surgery could be so romantic.

586
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:04,952
My life had gone bad...

587
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,581
before you.

588
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,502
And now it is more wonderful than ever.

589
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:20,676
And I cannot wait
until you become Mrs. Warner.

590
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:24,388
Mrs. H. Ty Warner.

591
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:27,429
You know that I'm keeping
my own name though, right?

592
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:29,768
Right.

593
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:34,231
Well, whoever you are,
whatever your name is,

594
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:37,025
we should get married
and grow old together.

595
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:41,613
Deal.

596
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:44,949
<i>Kumar residence.</i>

597
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,369
I was hoping you'd answer.
I've got exams all morning.

598
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,995
Could you update the site at 11:00?

599
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:51,582
Yeah, I could go to the library
in between my classes.

600
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:52,874
<i>Awesome. Thanks.</i>

601
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,167
I swapped Peanut in this morning.

602
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:57,087
He needs to drop a hint about Digger
tunneling out of the Beanie nursery.

603
00:38:57,088 --> 00:38:58,922
The collectors are gonna go crazy.

604
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:02,301
Hey, did you check out
that new auction website I told you about?

605
00:39:02,302 --> 00:39:04,970
No. Shit. I meant to. I'll do that today.

606
00:39:04,971 --> 00:39:07,639
- "ePort" or some shit?
<i>- eBay.</i>

607
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,142
eBay. Right.

608
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:12,310
Crap, I'm so late.

609
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:14,375
<i>- Because of the Peanut crab?</i>
- Wha... Mom?

610
00:39:14,376 --> 00:39:16,304
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

611
00:39:16,305 --> 00:39:18,232
<i>Who are you shit-shit-shitting?</i>

612
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:19,942
<i>There is no shit-shit-shitting
in this family.</i>

613
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:21,652
Sorry, she must have
picked up the extension.

614
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:24,448
<i>No shit, Sherlock.
Get to school, both of you.</i>

615
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:25,908
Yes, ma'am.

616
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,869
All right, gremlins, time-out!

617
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,330
- Hey, Maya. Come on in.
- Hi.

618
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:17,709
You know, you made Ty's year
with that new computer setup.

619
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,629
He won't stop talking about his RAM.

620
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:22,171
Sorry.

621
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:23,632
He's just through here.

622
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:28,595
Wow. So cute.

623
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,805
We spotted an enemy!

624
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:34,017
- Not so cute. Warmongers.
- Yes, yes, yes!

625
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:35,686
- Hey. Look who's here.
- Hi.

626
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:38,646
200 new thingies since noon.

627
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:40,440
I've got something even more exciting
to show you.

628
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:41,942
- Now you're trapped!
- Hey. Come on.

629
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:43,317
- Rascals.
- Sorry.

630
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:46,196
Okay, dazzle me.
Show me what couldn't wait till tomorrow.

631
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:50,868
You are not gonna believe this.

632
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:52,869
May I?

633
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:54,288
I'm sorry.

634
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,625
Okay.

635
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:02,588
- Come on.
- One sec.

636
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:06,258
Here.

637
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:13,640
Why are there photos and prices
of retired Beanie Babies on here?

638
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:16,560
- They can't sell these.
- No, these aren't retailers.

639
00:41:16,561 --> 00:41:17,685
They're customers,

640
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:19,813
reselling what they've already
bought from us.

641
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:23,024
It's an online auction site,
a genius idea.

642
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:26,445
Anybody can sell anything they want,
but we're the biggest thing on it.

643
00:41:26,446 --> 00:41:27,862
By a lot. Look.

644
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:32,533
Dotless Dots is listed at $55,
11 times retail.

645
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:35,245
- Well, we should sue them then.
- Well... No, we... What?

646
00:41:35,246 --> 00:41:36,537
We should kiss them.

647
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:38,664
Are you seeing what they're doing for us?

648
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:41,502
Yes. They're making a huge profit
on my products.

649
00:41:41,503 --> 00:41:44,253
Infringing on my trademarked...

650
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:46,965
- trademarked name.
- No, making everybody greedy

651
00:41:46,966 --> 00:41:48,424
for what we sell.

652
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:51,573
Not just as toys, but as investments.
As money makers.

653
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:54,723
I mean, we could not pay
for this kind of marketing.

654
00:41:54,724 --> 00:41:57,976
These photos are just awful.

655
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:01,063
I mean, amateur camera angles,
abysmal eye con...

656
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:02,940
Look at the eye contact. There's none.

657
00:42:02,941 --> 00:42:05,525
Zero. This is a disgrace.

658
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:08,612
The disgrace that's gonna
multiply our sales by a zillion.

659
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,033
Well, maybe we won't sue.

660
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:15,744
Yeah. This is a big deal, Ty.

661
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:17,537
We gotta play it right.

662
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:21,041
Okay, listen though.
I'm way too busy to handle all this crap.

663
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,293
You're gonna have to manage it, okay?

664
00:42:23,294 --> 00:42:25,086
- Yeah. Plan to.
- Okay.

665
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:27,381
I'm deferring med school
to come on board full-time.

666
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:29,466
You're still in school?

667
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:33,387
You know I am.
My parents want me to be a doctor.

668
00:42:33,388 --> 00:42:36,431
Doctors are a dime a dozen.
You are special.

669
00:42:36,432 --> 00:42:38,474
You don't need degrees to succeed.

670
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:40,894
Tell your folks
that all the greats quit school early.

671
00:42:40,895 --> 00:42:42,353
I quit my freshman year.

672
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:45,524
Yeah. Like you said, all the greats.

673
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:47,484
We're a great team, Maya Kumar.

674
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:49,528
Yes, we are.

675
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:55,284
We are a dream team, Robbie Jones. Unbeatable.

676
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:57,995
It's the cats!

677
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:02,332
Oh, God. Keep the fatties away.
We don't want fatties near the booth.

678
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:06,586
Are you joking?

679
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:08,297
No, they sweat on the fur.

680
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:11,675
Everyone is talking up this booth.

681
00:43:12,676 --> 00:43:13,719
Can I help you?

682
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:15,595
These are incredible.

683
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:18,389
They're so lifelike, and they're soft.

684
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,059
What a good idea,
under-stuffing them like this.

685
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,729
Thank you.
Can I get an order started for you?

686
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,021
- For sure.
- Great.

687
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:27,482
- I'll take two dozen for my store.
- Wonderful.

688
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:29,943
And a few for my kids.
They will just die for these.

689
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,626
I love that.

690
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:07,481
Oh, my God. I love this.

691
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:49,898
<i>It's amazing how quick ten years can go.</i>

692
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:55,529
<i>By '92, we'd built a six-million-dollar
business together from scratch,</i>

693
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:56,821
<i>broken up five times,</i>

694
00:44:56,822 --> 00:44:59,408
<i>and felt like we were
just getting started.</i>

695
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:02,431
You are one of a kind, Robbie Jones.

696
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:04,454
- One of a kind.
- Back at ya, Ty.

697
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:06,790
Though I can't believe you're
from Arkansas

698
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:08,250
and you've never met Clinton.

699
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:11,523
- Do you think he's gonna win?
- Yeah.

700
00:45:11,524 --> 00:45:13,797
- He's younger than I am.
- And taller.

701
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:16,884
And he has a kid.

702
00:45:18,594 --> 00:45:20,991
Do you think we should have kids?

703
00:45:20,992 --> 00:45:23,389
You're probably too old though.

704
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,225
We have a lot on our plate already,
don't you think?

705
00:45:25,226 --> 00:45:27,269
I mean, we're birthing an empire.

706
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:33,692
Listen. I think that we should
expand internationally.

707
00:45:33,693 --> 00:45:35,319
- What? No. No.
- Yes.

708
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,736
- Yes. Yes.
- No.

709
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:39,343
The market is perfect
for us to move into the UK.

710
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:41,950
- Plus, it'll stimulate domestic.
- I said no.

711
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:46,580
The number one mistake
that people make is they get too greedy.

712
00:45:46,581 --> 00:45:48,498
They start expanding too fast.

713
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:50,374
Plus, I'm loyal to America.

714
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:52,919
Okay,
what does that have to do with anything?

715
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,049
My products are made
by Americans for Americans, end of story.

716
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:01,323
Our products are made
for Americans by Asians.

717
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:04,848
Ty Inc.'s plush animals
are manufactured in China

718
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:06,349
- and Korea, as you well know.
- Yeah.

719
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,603
Paying us back for all the bills
America's paid for the entire world,

720
00:46:09,604 --> 00:46:10,728
and I think it's about time.

721
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:12,522
If you want other countries to pay us,

722
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:14,690
then we need to sell to them,
not buy from them.

723
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:18,862
And I am proposing
that we figure out how to sell to Europe.

724
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:20,864
Don't double-cross America, Robbie.

725
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,408
- I'm being serious.
- Okay.

726
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:25,077
- No, I am.
- I know. I hear.

727
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:28,914
You just sit there looking pretty,
okay, Paul Revere?

728
00:46:28,915 --> 00:46:30,248
I'll be over here,

729
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:32,584
running the actual real business,
like always.

730
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:41,468
I take requests, you know.

731
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:45,764
I wish we were doing this
at the new place,

732
00:46:45,765 --> 00:46:47,431
but it's still under construction.

733
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:49,893
It's bigger than this place.
Gorgeous light.

734
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:51,144
This is perfect.

735
00:46:52,271 --> 00:46:53,792
- So, when's the wedding?
- Very soon.

736
00:46:53,793 --> 00:46:55,314
- We're not sure.
- Soon though. Right?

737
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:57,526
- But we just... we don't know exactly when...
- Yeah, soon.

738
00:46:57,527 --> 00:46:59,152
- ...but soon.
- Very soon.

739
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,820
Things have just gotten busy.

740
00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:03,240
Well, these little critters
surely have taken off.

741
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:04,949
It must be so exciting for your family.

742
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,370
Very. Yeah.
Well, we love doing it all together.

743
00:47:08,371 --> 00:47:09,830
- Don't we, girls?
- Yeah.

744
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,374
Take one of me and Ava's ghost!

745
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:15,294
Yes, ma'am. Look at that.

746
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:18,255
- Can I get one of the entire family?
- Sure.

747
00:47:18,256 --> 00:47:20,174
- Okey dokey.
- Yeah.

748
00:47:20,175 --> 00:47:21,341
Come on up.

749
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:23,885
Thank you.

750
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:26,054
All right. Look at this.

751
00:47:27,556 --> 00:47:29,850
{\an8}The girls are thrilled by the photo.

752
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:33,687
Isn't it nice, what they said
about it being a family business?

753
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,941
Yeah.
I mean, it's just a dumb magazine piece.

754
00:47:37,942 --> 00:47:39,109
But great, yeah.

755
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:42,154
Yeah, but...

756
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:46,909
You know,
it's gonna be really wonderful to get away

757
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:49,453
and have some time to finally relax.
You know?

758
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:53,665
I think when we get back,
I'm gonna get another face-lift.

759
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:57,376
What? Why?

760
00:47:57,377 --> 00:48:01,840
Just to tighten things up.
We can get a family discount.

761
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:05,427
You could get some work done
on your nose or something.

762
00:48:06,178 --> 00:48:08,429
- What's wrong with my nose?
- Nothing.

763
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,183
It's just, you have this...
a little bump on it.

764
00:48:11,184 --> 00:48:12,475
Maren has one too.

765
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:15,728
Maren is not getting a nose job.

766
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:18,982
Of course not. She's a child.

767
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:21,652
I mean... But you're old enough.

768
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:25,447
Are you serious with this?

769
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:34,206
Sweetie.
Sweetie, you're beautiful. You are.

770
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:35,831
It was just a thought.

771
00:48:35,832 --> 00:48:38,669
I like having the power
to be able to shape myself,

772
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,504
and I thought you would too.

773
00:48:40,505 --> 00:48:42,339
We have a big year coming up,

774
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,423
and as the saying goes,

775
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:49,680
"Genius is 1% inspiration,
99% presentation."

776
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:52,432
That's not how the saying goes.

777
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:55,853
Okay. I... Yeah, all... Forget I brought...

778
00:48:56,395 --> 00:49:00,274
Forget I brought it up. It's just... Yeah.

779
00:49:04,987 --> 00:49:07,281
Mom, I can't find my floaties!

780
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:10,993
Yeah, I'm coming.

781
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:16,372
<i>Are they honeymooning in Florida?</i>

782
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:19,918
Just holiday vacationing.
He says he'll be tuning in tonight.

783
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:25,799
T-minus eight hours till showtime.
Move her this way.

784
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:27,593
Make her dance a little.

785
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:30,929
Will a 40-minute Shockwave movie
even play online?

786
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:33,390
'Cause I've only ever seen 30-second ones.

787
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:34,850
Welcome to the future.

788
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:47,863
<i>You've reached Maya.
Tell me something good.</i>

789
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:53,555
<i>How about you tell us when
you decided not to go to medical school?</i>

790
00:49:53,556 --> 00:49:56,954
<i>Your life is your life,
but we could at least be informed</i>

791
00:49:56,955 --> 00:50:00,792
<i>all that money we carefully saved
for your education is ours again,</i>

792
00:50:00,793 --> 00:50:02,252
<i>to do what we want with.</i>

793
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,046
<i>Maybe we'll do something risky
and impulsive.</i>

794
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:07,591
<i>See? See what you're doing to us?
Okay. Think about it.</i>

795
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,010
Hey! Hey! No, no, no, no!

796
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:15,140
It's almost midnight,
and my Beanies movie's about to go live.

797
00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:17,726
Hey, do one of the raps!

798
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,562
You mean the ones that boosted sales 40%?

799
00:50:20,563 --> 00:50:22,523
Yeah. Maybe later, maybe...

800
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:24,273
Okay, here we go.

801
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:29,488
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,

802
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:31,532
three, two, one.

803
00:50:36,286 --> 00:50:38,913
- Beanie Babies!
- What?

804
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:41,437
Beanie Babies! Beanie Babies!

805
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,960
It won't download. I keep trying.

806
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:46,547
Too many people are
logging on to the site at once.

807
00:50:46,548 --> 00:50:48,048
So, no one can see anything?

808
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:51,844
Oh, shit. I'm gonna get fired.

809
00:50:52,803 --> 00:50:54,680
We broke the entire Internet thing!

810
00:50:56,348 --> 00:50:57,640
Not exactly.

811
00:50:57,641 --> 00:51:00,102
It was our personal server lines
that got overwhelmed.

812
00:51:00,103 --> 00:51:02,520
By 18 million Beanie Baby lovers. Unbelievable.

813
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:05,274
Again, that's not the amount
of people on our site, but...

814
00:51:05,275 --> 00:51:06,858
Amazing. It's just fantastic.

815
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:08,777
Did I get any press calls about it?

816
00:51:08,778 --> 00:51:10,194
- Who are you?
- Hi.

817
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:13,323
This is Linda Wallace, one of
the original Beanie Baby collectors.

818
00:51:13,324 --> 00:51:15,242
- Oh, God.
- It is such an honor to...

819
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:18,203
Just one sec.

820
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:21,915
Remember I told you about the cul-de-sac
that started the local craze?

821
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:24,418
Well, Linda was ground zero.

822
00:51:24,419 --> 00:51:25,502
Guilty.

823
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:29,965
Linda does the <i>Beanie Baby Collectors</i>
radio update on WGN now.

824
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:31,592
You agreed to meet?

825
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:34,761
And it... I am just beyond excited
to meet you,

826
00:51:34,762 --> 00:51:37,555
Ty Warner, in person. Wow.

827
00:51:37,556 --> 00:51:39,307
You do a radio show about my products?

828
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:42,748
{\an8}Plus, I actually publish
the <i>Beanie Baby Price Guide</i>,

829
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:46,190
{\an8}which people call the bible
of the collectors' market.

830
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,399
{\an8}I was hoping you'd sign it.

831
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,904
And who gave you permission to do that?
Just out of curiosity.

832
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:54,363
I didn't know I needed to get...

833
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:56,950
Well, the guide drives tons
of customers to our site.

834
00:51:56,951 --> 00:51:58,618
{\an8}I mean, nothing hooks new collectors

835
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:01,455
{\an8}like hearing Linda made $300,000
on Beanies.

836
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:03,456
300,000?

837
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:04,917
In just three months.

838
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:06,584
How exactly?

839
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:10,589
Well, there I was, just snapping up
as many as I could here in the States,

840
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,653
but then my sister went to Liverpool,

841
00:52:12,654 --> 00:52:14,717
which... She's a real Beatle maniac...

842
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:18,180
And she saw piles of Iggy the Iguana
and Whisper the Deer,

843
00:52:18,181 --> 00:52:20,014
which I have been looking everywhere for.

844
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:22,851
So, I tracked down the number
of your UK distributor,

845
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:25,186
ordered 200 pieces direct,
plus shipping fees.

846
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:27,773
Whole thing cost me $2,000
and very nearly my marriage,

847
00:52:27,774 --> 00:52:30,526
but 90 days later,
those babies bought us a BMW

848
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:32,318
and a time-share in Florida.

849
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,364
So now people listen
when I tell them Beanies

850
00:52:35,365 --> 00:52:37,199
are the best investment around.

851
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:42,037
Plus, they're cute as all get-out.
You know that.

852
00:52:42,038 --> 00:52:44,414
Oh, gosh, you just gotta come on my show.

853
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:48,584
<i>Ty filed a lawsuit by the end
of the following day.</i>

854
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:51,129
<i>And he forced eBay
to change its "Beanie Babies" category</i>

855
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,965
{\an8}<i>to "Beanbag Plush."</i>

856
00:52:53,465 --> 00:52:56,426
<i>But by then, the craze was uncontrollable.</i>

857
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,055
<i>Beanie Babies
are selling hotter than tamales.</i>

858
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:04,560
{\an8}<i>The beanbag has
been transformed into a commercial rage.</i>

859
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:05,935
{\an8}<i>To protect themselves,</i>

860
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:10,107
{\an8}<i>delivery workers have been painting
over Ty's logos on the boxes they deliver.</i>

861
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:14,944
<i>People were buying
and selling half a million dollars</i>

862
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:19,324
<i>of Beanie Babies on eBay every month,
which was bonkers.</i>

863
00:53:19,325 --> 00:53:20,825
<i>But what they couldn't see</i>

864
00:53:20,826 --> 00:53:24,329
<i>was that everybody who wanted a piece
of that was buying new,</i>

865
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:26,622
<i>off the shelf from us.</i>

866
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:29,501
{\an8}<i>So when eBay did half a million dollars,</i>

867
00:53:29,502 --> 00:53:32,796
<i>we did 400 times that in retail.</i>

868
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:37,634
<i>$200 million every month.</i>

869
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:41,013
<i>It was so much money.</i>

870
00:53:45,142 --> 00:53:47,895
<i>And we were constantly
expanding just to keep up.</i>

871
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:54,693
<i>Everything just got
a little bit out of control.</i>

872
00:53:57,738 --> 00:53:58,739
<i>Ty included.</i>

873
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:03,285
Maya. Did you see the latest numbers?

874
00:54:03,286 --> 00:54:04,578
People keep wanting more.

875
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:06,871
Mr. Warner, a word?

876
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:08,289
No, thanks. Who's this?

877
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,291
Rep from Toys "R" Us or Walmart.

878
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:13,253
- Well, get rid of him.
- We tried. They keep coming back.

879
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:16,255
Hey! We only sell to mom-and-pops.

880
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:18,716
No big-box stores, is that understood?

881
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:22,387
And why don't we sell to big-box stores?
Anyone?

882
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,138
Okay, Maya, go ahead.

883
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:27,893
Their cheap product displays
invite price wars and comparison shopping.

884
00:54:27,894 --> 00:54:29,811
The America...
The... More the America stuff.

885
00:54:29,812 --> 00:54:30,937
Right.

886
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:34,566
Big-box stores kill small businesses
and trash the dreams of the little guy.

887
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:37,777
And America is all about the little guy.

888
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:40,988
And we are all about the little guy.

889
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:42,990
Marcus, is that shipment
from China on time?

890
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:45,577
Yes. They wanna know how many
new models we're introducing next month?

891
00:54:45,578 --> 00:54:46,953
Well, everybody wants to know that.

892
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:49,373
Also, they asked about
an Asian distribution deal like the UK.

893
00:54:49,374 --> 00:54:53,960
No, listen! No UK! No UK!

894
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:57,673
Hey, did you see those tweaks
that I made to the platypus design?

895
00:54:57,674 --> 00:54:59,507
I did. They were very good.

896
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:00,800
- Yeah. I knew you'd like them.
- Yeah.

897
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:03,846
I'm sorry to interrupt, but <i>Parade</i> needs
an answer about the profile.

898
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:07,057
They'd like to interview Ava too
about the popularity of Spooky.

899
00:55:07,058 --> 00:55:09,225
The audience reach could be huge.

900
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:11,436
First of all, Spooky is not that popular.

901
00:55:11,437 --> 00:55:13,813
And also, no more dinky press, okay?

902
00:55:13,814 --> 00:55:15,606
<i>Parade</i> has over 20 million subscribers.

903
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:20,362
I only want to speak to Oprah Winfrey.
Has she reached out?

904
00:55:20,363 --> 00:55:22,113
- Not yet.
- Thank you.

905
00:55:22,114 --> 00:55:24,490
Steven Spielberg's office called again
and now they're offering

906
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:27,536
- triple what they were offering before.
- Not interested again. I'm not a sellout.

907
00:55:27,537 --> 00:55:29,662
Is that selling out to Mattel
and the Barbie tie-in then?

908
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:32,666
I am sorry for that. I will pass,
and I'll pass on McDonald's as well.

909
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:34,918
Why would you do that? I love McDonald's.

910
00:55:34,919 --> 00:55:36,587
- You do?
- Yes. Of course.

911
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:40,382
Of course I love McD... Everybody loves...
The president loves McDonald's.

912
00:55:40,383 --> 00:55:42,258
- You love McDonald's, right?
- Fiercely.

913
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:44,845
Don't you think partnering with them
might be too big a strain

914
00:55:44,846 --> 00:55:47,346
- on our distribution system?
- Oh, my God.

915
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:49,640
Can you imagine the markets
that's gonna open up?

916
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:52,102
Sure, but we can barely keep up
with the mom-and-pops already.

917
00:55:52,103 --> 00:55:53,853
It would be like a Super Bowl ad
for a bake sale.

918
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:57,399
- You heard her. We love McDonald's.
- Great. I will follow up.

919
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,652
- Mickey D's!
- Ty, I mean, it's thrilling

920
00:56:00,653 --> 00:56:02,153
the demand for Beanies is so nuts,

921
00:56:02,154 --> 00:56:05,239
but we gotta be able to handle it.
Remember New Year's?

922
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,161
Listen, we can put even tinier
Beanie Babies inside of Happy Meals.

923
00:56:09,162 --> 00:56:13,831
Little tiny guys. It'd be so cute.
And adorable.

924
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:17,211
Profitable. Go with me to the airport.
I wanna go over designs.

925
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:22,341
<i>It's hard to know how
to reason with delusion.</i>

926
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:26,365
<i>And sometimes you just
go along to get along.</i>

927
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:29,014
<i>By late '92, Clinton was president,</i>

928
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:32,476
<i>and I was in London
nailing down foreign expansion.</i>

929
00:56:33,936 --> 00:56:35,520
<i>It's only 3:00 my time.</i>

930
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:38,190
I could stay here all night,
but I don't want to keep you.

931
00:56:38,191 --> 00:56:41,234
Were you able
to look at the proposal I faxed?

932
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:44,279
- Yes, and it's quite tempting.
- Good. Good.

933
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,281
But I'm afraid there's a bit of a snag.

934
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:50,118
Surely there's nothing we can't work out.

935
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:55,248
Legal says we can't make a deal with you

936
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:58,001
since you're not technically
the owner of Ty Inc.

937
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,132
My partner and I run the company together.

938
00:57:04,883 --> 00:57:05,925
I do the deals,

939
00:57:05,926 --> 00:57:08,386
he signs off once I walk him
through the numbers.

940
00:57:08,387 --> 00:57:10,848
It's... We've been working
like this for years.

941
00:57:10,849 --> 00:57:13,559
I'm sure it's just a miscommunication.

942
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:16,854
But we've been told differently.

943
00:57:22,693 --> 00:57:24,151
I thought you knew.

944
00:57:24,152 --> 00:57:26,153
He said your priorities had changed

945
00:57:26,154 --> 00:57:29,366
and he was restructuring the company
based on both your wishes.

946
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:32,369
I got the sense you were trying
to have a child.

947
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:35,831
No. No, no, no. No.

948
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:39,501
You need to restore
the previous agreement immediately.

949
00:57:40,169 --> 00:57:42,629
I'm sorry, Robbie, but my hands are tied.

950
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,593
That looks great, Ty.

951
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:49,802
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

952
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:51,596
I'm just working on my smile. Okay.

953
00:57:51,597 --> 00:57:53,807
Just let me get my smile,
then I'll go like this,

954
00:57:53,808 --> 00:57:55,538
and then you snap your picture.

955
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:57,269
Sure. Okay, you let me know when.

956
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:01,648
- Go.
- No, I... Okay.

957
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:03,232
No, I think we got it.

958
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:05,569
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- Hey, Robbie, just...

959
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:07,196
- Take five.
- Yeah.

960
00:58:08,155 --> 00:58:10,406
Okay, hon, what seems to be the...
Welcome back.

961
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:12,659
Fuck you.
You know exactly what the problem is.

962
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:17,559
Your little restructuring stunt
is a sick joke.

963
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,668
Robbie.
This has always been Ty Inc., right?

964
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:26,548
I mean, you've been an incredible helper,
but this has always been my company.

965
00:58:28,926 --> 00:58:30,760
Are you fucking kidding?

966
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:34,056
Roberta,
you know I don't like that rough language.

967
00:58:34,723 --> 00:58:36,390
You know what I don't like?

968
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:42,022
Getting fucked out of a company I created,
that we created together.

969
00:58:42,023 --> 00:58:44,482
That's not happening.
Why do you have to be so dramatic?

970
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:48,487
I am no longer cofounder,
and my salary has been reduced 75%.

971
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:51,781
Okay.
Can you keep your voice down a little bit?

972
00:58:51,782 --> 00:58:53,992
Don't fucking tell me
to keep my voice down!

973
00:58:55,953 --> 00:58:57,745
That wasn't salary. That was commissions.

974
00:58:57,746 --> 00:59:01,708
And commissions don't make sense at the
level we're working at now. They don't.

975
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:03,293
Do you even know
what you're talking about?

976
00:59:03,294 --> 00:59:05,337
Yeah, I'm just doing what's necessary.

977
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:09,299
You know, running the real
actual business over here.

978
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:19,851
And as far as expanding into the UK,
now's not the time.

979
00:59:19,852 --> 00:59:23,564
But when it is,
I have our perfect partners lined up.

980
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:27,585
Actually came up with the idea
in the shower, believe it or not.

981
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:29,653
Jehovah's Witnesses.

982
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:34,709
The greatest one-on-one salesmen
in the world. How brilliant is that?

983
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:40,998
Robbie,
I... Honestly, what is the big deal?

984
00:59:40,999 --> 00:59:43,457
I mean, we're still together.

985
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:46,837
We're not breaking up.
We're still partners in everything.

986
00:59:46,838 --> 00:59:49,089
I mean, what is mine is yours.

987
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:52,467
You have the golden ticket. You have me.

988
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:58,056
What a prize.

989
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:04,103
It's pointless to talk to you
when you're like this.

990
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:06,273
- I mean...
- When I stand up for myself, you mean.

991
01:00:06,274 --> 01:00:08,066
Yeah, what a bummer for you.

992
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:12,946
You should call one of your easier women.
Lorraine from the coffee shop.

993
01:00:13,488 --> 01:00:15,616
- Julie from the dry cleaner.
- Okay.

994
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:18,368
Any one of the dozens
from the trade circuit.

995
01:00:18,369 --> 01:00:20,036
I know about them all, Ty.

996
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:24,833
- Okay. We mutually agreed to occasion...
- Go fuck yourself.

997
01:00:24,834 --> 01:00:29,004
You're a child. A selfish child.

998
01:00:30,339 --> 01:00:34,593
And I cannot believe
how long I've put up with it.

999
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:38,555
Hey, listen to me.

1000
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:42,226
If it wasn't for me, you'd still be
wasting away at the Speedi-Shop.

1001
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:46,104
Where's the gratitude?
I've given you an amazing life.

1002
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:48,690
I made you.

1003
01:00:53,529 --> 01:00:56,364
Mrs. Warner. We're waiting.

1004
01:00:56,365 --> 01:00:59,201
You guys, this is definitely the one.

1005
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:04,748
- No, you don't like it? What?
- We love it.

1006
01:01:04,749 --> 01:01:05,999
Never take it off.

1007
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:11,463
Have I told you how excited we are
that this wedding is finally happening?

1008
01:01:12,464 --> 01:01:13,464
Thank you.

1009
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:15,633
So have you guys picked a honeymoon?

1010
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:19,304
Yeah, Fiji. All of us, we're all going.
"Familymoon."

1011
01:01:19,305 --> 01:01:22,975
A familymoon in Fiji, all right.
Better live this dream.

1012
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:29,439
- Hello? Ty?
- Hi, Mom!

1013
01:01:29,982 --> 01:01:31,191
We're in here.

1014
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:33,527
Ty ran away.

1015
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:37,822
What? Where'd he go?

1016
01:01:37,823 --> 01:01:40,200
Out the door. I don't know.

1017
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:42,202
Maybe the new house?

1018
01:01:42,203 --> 01:01:43,287
Oh, my God.

1019
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,163
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Of course.

1020
01:01:46,164 --> 01:01:48,834
They're asleep in their room,
and I don't know how long I'll be, but...

1021
01:01:48,835 --> 01:01:50,001
Okay, don't worry. Just go.

1022
01:01:50,002 --> 01:01:51,837
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah, be careful.

1023
01:02:12,316 --> 01:02:13,442
Ty?

1024
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:21,909
Sweetheart?

1025
01:02:35,047 --> 01:02:36,048
Ty?

1026
01:02:55,442 --> 01:02:56,443
Ty?

1027
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:09,706
Sweetheart? What happened? Are you okay?

1028
01:03:09,707 --> 01:03:12,000
I can't. I just can't. I can't.

1029
01:03:12,918 --> 01:03:14,586
Can't what?

1030
01:03:15,379 --> 01:03:17,256
I can't do this.

1031
01:03:18,215 --> 01:03:20,801
Honey, what's happened? What's going on?

1032
01:03:20,802 --> 01:03:22,719
I just... Getting married.

1033
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,974
I don't know how to do family.

1034
01:03:29,977 --> 01:03:31,060
I don't know how to...

1035
01:03:31,061 --> 01:03:32,980
I don't know how to do this. I...

1036
01:03:34,022 --> 01:03:35,315
I didn't have a family.

1037
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,610
No one ever...
Do you know... No one ever even...

1038
01:03:38,611 --> 01:03:41,092
- Hey. Sweetheart.
- Do you know...

1039
01:03:41,093 --> 01:03:43,574
- No one ever...
- You're loved now.

1040
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:47,327
The girls and I love you so much.

1041
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:54,710
I can't be a parent.

1042
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:02,384
I'm the child.

1043
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:07,264
I need to be taken care of.

1044
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:17,566
Hey.

1045
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:25,908
It's okay. Sweetheart.

1046
01:04:27,868 --> 01:04:28,994
I need you.

1047
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,627
Hold me like I'm a little boy.

1048
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:57,647
- Hi.
- Hi, ma'am.

1049
01:04:57,648 --> 01:05:00,359
I'm gonna need access
to the garage to unload.

1050
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:05,447
- Returned products, 48 boxes?
- Yeah sure.

1051
01:05:05,448 --> 01:05:06,532
Okay.

1052
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:09,826
All right. Thank you.

1053
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:12,204
- Great. I'll open up.
- All right.

1054
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,090
Gorgeous light, isn't it?

1055
01:05:24,466 --> 01:05:27,928
I know you love window seats,
so I ordered a whole wall of them.

1056
01:05:33,141 --> 01:05:34,685
We need to talk.

1057
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:40,148
Listen, the freak-out last night.

1058
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:43,985
It's over.

1059
01:05:43,986 --> 01:05:46,946
I feel much better now. I do.

1060
01:05:46,947 --> 01:05:49,908
Good. Well, I wish I did.

1061
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:53,537
You don't wanna sit down?

1062
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:06,884
I'm in love with you, Ty.
But I didn't wanna be.

1063
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:11,722
I was gonna stay single
for Maren and Ava, remember?

1064
01:06:12,848 --> 01:06:14,975
Spare them a man abandoning them.

1065
01:06:16,268 --> 01:06:22,399
But you convinced me you were different, devoted.

1066
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:25,110
And then you pull this?

1067
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:28,697
No.

1068
01:06:34,244 --> 01:06:36,663
No, you gotta
find someone else to be your mom.

1069
01:06:36,664 --> 01:06:38,248
- I'm booked already.
- Wait.

1070
01:06:38,249 --> 01:06:39,333
What are you saying?

1071
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:47,007
I'm saying, I let you in to be a partner,
to really build something good together.

1072
01:06:47,008 --> 01:06:48,884
And if you can do that, wonderful.

1073
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:52,346
But I'm not gonna stick around
if you plan to fuck it up.

1074
01:07:02,689 --> 01:07:06,109
I'm sorry. You're right.

1075
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:11,698
You're right. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1076
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:17,329
I will never let you down again. I swear.

1077
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:22,543
Please don't leave. Please.

1078
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:26,880
Everything good that's happened to me
is because of you guys. Did you know that?

1079
01:07:26,881 --> 01:07:32,469
We are bonded forever.
There's no one I'd rather be with.

1080
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,014
Do you understand that?

1081
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:40,310
You're my home.

1082
01:07:41,687 --> 01:07:43,272
You're my rock.

1083
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:46,149
You're my life.

1084
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:00,622
<i>Break out those raincoats
and umbrellas, folks.</i>

1085
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:02,039
<i>We got a few days of rain...</i>

1086
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,668
- Do you know what you want?
- Nuggets. Always.

1087
01:08:04,669 --> 01:08:06,712
Same. Sweet and sour or honey?

1088
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:10,214
Barbecue. What's wrong with you?

1089
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:13,217
<i>Riots broke out at McDonald's
restaurants across the nation today</i>

1090
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:16,220
<i>as the company
launched their Teenie Beanie promotion.</i>

1091
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:17,138
Yeah.

1092
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:19,474
<i>The first batch of Beanies was meant
to last two weeks, but ran out...</i>

1093
01:08:19,475 --> 01:08:22,394
Can you believe something we work on
is that popular?

1094
01:08:22,395 --> 01:08:23,729
Yes.

1095
01:08:36,867 --> 01:08:38,910
What is happening?

1096
01:08:38,911 --> 01:08:42,288
<i>At one McDonald's,
a delivery man arriving with a case</i>

1097
01:08:42,289 --> 01:08:45,000
of the Teenie Beanies was tackled

1098
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:46,709
by overzealous customers.

1099
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:50,546
Thanks to this little guy,
the Cubs sold out Wrigley Field today

1100
01:08:50,547 --> 01:08:52,423
for the first time in decades.

1101
01:08:52,424 --> 01:08:54,884
{\an8}Two divorcées unable to reach an agreement

1102
01:08:54,885 --> 01:08:58,094
{\an8}about how to split their
prized Beanie Baby collection

1103
01:08:58,095 --> 01:09:01,183
{\an8}were ordered to make their picks
under judicial supervision.

1104
01:09:01,184 --> 01:09:03,184
US Trade Rep Charlene Barshefsky

1105
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:05,958
has turned over
the 40 Beanie Babies she procured

1106
01:09:05,959 --> 01:09:08,732
in Beijing during her trip
with President Clinton,

1107
01:09:08,733 --> 01:09:10,233
in violation of trade law.

1108
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:12,527
Traffic on I-95 shut down for hours

1109
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:15,655
{\an8}after a crashed semi
carrying Beanie Babies

1110
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:18,075
{\an8}<i>sparked a frenzy you have
to see to believe.</i>

1111
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:24,997
Looking good.

1112
01:09:26,457 --> 01:09:27,834
Did you see the latest numbers?

1113
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:30,379
Billion dollar profit year. Congrats.

1114
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:34,424
I'm gonna make over $700 million. Just me.

1115
01:09:35,843 --> 01:09:37,553
Did you see the truck crash
with the Beanies?

1116
01:09:37,554 --> 01:09:38,886
Insane.

1117
01:09:39,388 --> 01:09:41,179
Poor Beanies. But...

1118
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:44,350
I mean, managing the craze has
become a whole separate job.

1119
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:48,354
Which is why I wanted
to talk to you, if you've got a sec.

1120
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:49,772
I'm all ears.

1121
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:52,526
I think it's time for you
to consider a company restructure.

1122
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:54,944
And what do you mean by that?

1123
01:09:54,945 --> 01:09:58,657
Well, everyone knows you're
a superstar design and marketing genius,

1124
01:09:58,658 --> 01:09:59,824
like no one else alive.

1125
01:09:59,825 --> 01:10:02,410
I mean, it just...
it seems silly to distract you

1126
01:10:02,411 --> 01:10:05,747
from your natural talents
with mundane business chores.

1127
01:10:06,331 --> 01:10:08,374
I know Robbie used to handle all those.

1128
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:10,419
I don't wanna hear that name. Thank you.

1129
01:10:10,961 --> 01:10:15,716
But this company has transformed into
a mega success since then. Thanks to you.

1130
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:18,177
You just need
to keep channeling your brilliance

1131
01:10:18,178 --> 01:10:20,344
where it's most fun and fulfilling.

1132
01:10:20,345 --> 01:10:26,226
While you, you know, tap someone you trust
to handle pesky, day-to-day headaches.

1133
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:30,480
Chief operating officer.
A consigliere. A right hand.

1134
01:10:31,982 --> 01:10:33,816
Someone to deal with all the boring stuff,

1135
01:10:33,817 --> 01:10:37,154
freeing you up to continue doing the real,
important work.

1136
01:10:44,203 --> 01:10:45,204
I like it.

1137
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:49,144
Yep. There we go.
You're the best. Keep it up.

1138
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:52,586
<i>I liked the bullshit and the boring stuff.</i>

1139
01:10:52,587 --> 01:10:53,878
What's next?

1140
01:10:53,879 --> 01:10:55,963
<i>- Solving puzzles, connecting dots...</i>
- Hi.

1141
01:10:55,964 --> 01:10:58,634
<i>- ...streamlining the system. Making it grow.</i>
- I actually have this for you.

1142
01:10:58,635 --> 01:10:59,675
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1143
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:02,262
<i>Thank God for the great equalizer
of the Internet,</i>

1144
01:11:02,846 --> 01:11:05,140
<i>saving me from ten years
of higher education,</i>

1145
01:11:05,141 --> 01:11:06,390
<i>setting me up to take charge of...</i>

1146
01:11:06,391 --> 01:11:10,123
- Everybody, listen up! Meet Blaine.
- Hi, team.

1147
01:11:10,124 --> 01:11:13,857
Ty has brought me
on to put the fun in restructure

1148
01:11:13,858 --> 01:11:15,942
and take this company to the next level.

1149
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:20,656
So, who's with me?
Who is ready to go big or go home?

1150
01:11:20,657 --> 01:11:22,824
Come on. Let me hear ya.
Let me hear you now.

1151
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:24,535
There you go.

1152
01:11:25,244 --> 01:11:26,828
What a bastard.

1153
01:11:27,955 --> 01:11:29,997
Well, if it's any consolation,

1154
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:32,459
everyone knows you're the one
really running the show.

1155
01:11:35,295 --> 01:11:36,380
It isn't.

1156
01:11:38,715 --> 01:11:41,009
I created and built this company,

1157
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:45,722
and I have no rights, no salary claims.

1158
01:11:47,599 --> 01:11:49,141
How is that even possible?

1159
01:11:49,142 --> 01:11:52,521
'Cause the system isn't designed
for people like us.

1160
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:54,898
Fucking hell.

1161
01:11:56,984 --> 01:11:59,653
I spent my whole fucking life
taking care of people.

1162
01:12:01,029 --> 01:12:05,200
And I thought Ty was the one person
who didn't need that.

1163
01:12:10,455 --> 01:12:13,417
What the fuck is that? Come here.

1164
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:18,589
Oh, boy.

1165
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:23,384
That ass-face is spying on me?

1166
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:27,097
- All of us probably.
- That fucked-up motherfucker.

1167
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:30,183
He's heard a lot of stuff
I really wish he hadn't.

1168
01:12:30,184 --> 01:12:32,686
There's gotta be a way
we can use this against him.

1169
01:12:37,357 --> 01:12:39,568
Uh-huh. See you then.

1170
01:12:41,653 --> 01:12:43,906
Hey. Showtime.

1171
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:47,241
So, I just didn't see the brilliance

1172
01:12:47,242 --> 01:12:50,871
of the whole UK, Jehovah's Witness idea,
because I was so mad.

1173
01:12:50,872 --> 01:12:52,872
Sure, that temper of yours.

1174
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:58,253
But it is pure genius.
I just... Not that I would tell him that.

1175
01:12:58,254 --> 01:13:01,882
Of course not. But Jehovah's Witnesses,
who'd have thunk?

1176
01:13:01,883 --> 01:13:04,008
It takes a brain like Ty's.

1177
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:08,096
That total virtuoso,
off-the-charts mastermind.

1178
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,433
So, you guys good again?

1179
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:17,147
Getting there. He'll probably buy me

1180
01:13:17,648 --> 01:13:21,401
some amazing gift,
and then I'll be putty in his hands again.

1181
01:13:21,402 --> 01:13:24,112
Haven't you been wanting to learn guitar?

1182
01:13:24,113 --> 01:13:26,031
- I don't know.
- No.

1183
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:33,497
<i>- Beta</i>, tell us what's wrong.
- Everything.

1184
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:38,876
Thought I had it all figured out.

1185
01:13:38,877 --> 01:13:41,587
But my boss hired some slick
idiot consultant instead.

1186
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:44,883
You've been fired? After all that you
gave up, they fired you?

1187
01:13:45,384 --> 01:13:48,407
I still have my job.
I just wanted a better one.

1188
01:13:48,408 --> 01:13:51,431
Okay, you're 22.
These things, they take time.

1189
01:13:51,432 --> 01:13:53,392
I've been there five years.

1190
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:57,271
I understand the company better
than anyone, and I see where it's going.

1191
01:13:57,272 --> 01:13:58,647
Which is where, exactly?

1192
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:02,734
Well, soon we'll finally be able to keep
up with the demand for Beanie Babies.

1193
01:14:02,735 --> 01:14:04,026
Which will actually be a problem,

1194
01:14:04,027 --> 01:14:06,864
because a lot of their appeal
has been how hard they are to get.

1195
01:14:08,156 --> 01:14:09,532
So, you're saying this will be trouble?

1196
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:11,994
Yeah, if we don't get ahead of it,
yeah, definitely.

1197
01:14:11,995 --> 01:14:13,412
How much time do we have?

1198
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:17,165
I mean, it's not like there are
precise metrics for measuring, like...

1199
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:24,464
Wait.

1200
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:30,679
You'll be sick of me, I'll be
in Tokyo so much, as much as needed.

1201
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,514
The Asian launch is my top focus.

1202
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:35,434
Hey, team.

1203
01:14:35,934 --> 01:14:40,355
What a surprise. This is Maya Kumar,
our online girl.

1204
01:14:40,356 --> 01:14:43,608
Maya, this is Mr. Harano. Mr. Suzuki.

1205
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:46,069
They're interested in partnering with us
for the Japan market.

1206
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:48,112
We were just laying out a road map

1207
01:14:48,113 --> 01:14:51,700
for creating the kind of demand there
that we did here.

1208
01:14:51,701 --> 01:14:52,783
Great.

1209
01:14:52,784 --> 01:14:55,871
Then you already talked about our unique
relationship with the secondary market

1210
01:14:55,872 --> 01:14:58,957
and the crucial role it plays
in any smart strategy going forward?

1211
01:14:58,958 --> 01:15:01,627
Yes. We covered how we control
the collector craze

1212
01:15:01,628 --> 01:15:03,377
with limited runs and retirements,

1213
01:15:03,378 --> 01:15:06,340
and how that fuels demand
for the entire line.

1214
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,883
And how it's the unlimited runs

1215
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:11,803
where we and our distribution partners
make the big bucks.

1216
01:15:11,804 --> 01:15:14,722
See, the primary market,
that's where the profits are.

1217
01:15:14,723 --> 01:15:20,729
And the secondary market, while handy,
well, it's secondary.

1218
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:23,814
- No offense, Maya.
- No, none taken.

1219
01:15:23,815 --> 01:15:26,527
Demand is what we all care about.
Demand is king.

1220
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:30,030
It's amazing how we can now measure
and understand that demand

1221
01:15:30,031 --> 01:15:32,240
using secondary market tools to help us

1222
01:15:32,241 --> 01:15:35,285
steer our business
more skillfully than ever before.

1223
01:15:35,286 --> 01:15:38,330
Uh-huh. So, back to the rollout.
I think the smarter...

1224
01:15:38,331 --> 01:15:39,790
What are these tools?

1225
01:15:41,542 --> 01:15:46,712
Well, the most basic is using
eBay markups to measure demand.

1226
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:51,134
So this is how much we ship, and this is
how much they're marking them up on eBay.

1227
01:15:52,177 --> 01:15:55,973
On the high end, we've seen
Peanut the Elephant go for $7,000.

1228
01:15:57,474 --> 01:16:00,727
And on the low end,
there's no markup at all.

1229
01:16:01,645 --> 01:16:04,272
The more we ship, the lower the markup.

1230
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:08,944
But if we ever cross zero,
market collapses.

1231
01:16:08,945 --> 01:16:11,238
- Which will not happen.
- No.

1232
01:16:11,239 --> 01:16:13,531
We actively monitor that threshold,

1233
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:16,785
and we ship
up to 33 million Beanies a month,

1234
01:16:16,786 --> 01:16:19,037
before there's any cause for concern.

1235
01:16:19,038 --> 01:16:21,789
Right, 33 million.

1236
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:24,333
But that's just our simplest projection.

1237
01:16:24,334 --> 01:16:27,963
And it's not the full picture,
because demand isn't static.

1238
01:16:27,964 --> 01:16:30,798
We now have a gold mine of data
from the eBay market.

1239
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:33,969
Bids on a given model,
percentage where reserve is never met.

1240
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:37,430
Timing of response bids,
plus a half a dozen others.

1241
01:16:37,431 --> 01:16:41,393
These metrics give us incredible
new insight on where demand is headed.

1242
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:47,649
So in three months,
it'll be in this range.

1243
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:50,611
So number is not 33 million.

1244
01:16:51,445 --> 01:16:54,823
It could be as low as 26 million.

1245
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:57,617
I mean, worst-case scenario.

1246
01:16:57,618 --> 01:17:00,161
And thankfully, our worst-case scenario

1247
01:17:00,162 --> 01:17:02,705
is still overwhelming global demand.

1248
01:17:02,706 --> 01:17:05,875
Provided we understand,
respect and protect it.

1249
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:09,421
So instead of just blindly pushing
our numbers up and hoping for the best,

1250
01:17:09,422 --> 01:17:13,634
we here at Ty grow our market
strategically, confidently,

1251
01:17:13,635 --> 01:17:16,552
using tools no one's ever used before.

1252
01:17:16,553 --> 01:17:19,055
I mean, we're light-years ahead
of everyone on this stuff.

1253
01:17:19,056 --> 01:17:22,100
And that's why we're the most
successful toy company in the world.

1254
01:17:28,273 --> 01:17:31,088
Well, that was great. They were impressed.

1255
01:17:31,089 --> 01:17:33,904
Good. I'm glad. But it wasn't for them.

1256
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:36,782
My life is this company.
You know that, right?

1257
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:41,411
They're totally in. They just asked
for the same terms as the UK.

1258
01:17:41,412 --> 01:17:45,165
Hey. No. We don't talk about the UK! Ever.

1259
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:48,918
Okay. Yeah, I'll... No worries.
I'll fix it.

1260
01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:51,129
- They're gonna be incredible partners.
- Thank you.

1261
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:57,219
Gotta be honest, Ty.
Blaine doesn't understand our company.

1262
01:17:57,719 --> 01:17:59,220
I don't think we need his advice.

1263
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:02,432
Well, he has some things to learn,
but he has an amazing track record.

1264
01:18:02,433 --> 01:18:05,268
Maximizing profits
at soulless corporations.

1265
01:18:05,269 --> 01:18:08,897
But we're unique.
Our dysfunction is part of our heart.

1266
01:18:08,898 --> 01:18:12,067
I mean,
no one knows that better than you. And me.

1267
01:18:13,944 --> 01:18:18,323
I'm the person for this job, Ty.
You don't need outsiders.

1268
01:18:18,324 --> 01:18:20,951
I helped take Ty Inc.
from millions to billions.

1269
01:18:20,952 --> 01:18:22,201
And I've loved it.

1270
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:25,497
Coming up with the poems,
running the website, fostering the market.

1271
01:18:25,498 --> 01:18:28,374
I mean, everything. But in all this time,

1272
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:30,919
I've only ever had an "assistant" title
and an hourly wage.

1273
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,212
You've had raises.

1274
01:18:32,713 --> 01:18:36,842
True. I started at minimum wage.
And now I make $12 an hour.

1275
01:18:39,219 --> 01:18:43,557
Well, I know a lot of people
that would like to make $12 an hour.

1276
01:18:45,142 --> 01:18:47,936
Considering all I do,
I think there's room for improvement.

1277
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:52,023
We were the first company to have
a website for our customers.

1278
01:18:52,024 --> 01:18:55,027
Have you noticed everyone does that now?
That was my idea.

1279
01:18:55,611 --> 01:19:01,158
But using my resources, or my initiative.
I mean, I'm paying you to have ideas.

1280
01:19:01,159 --> 01:19:04,578
Well, I've netted a fortune
for this company, over and over.

1281
01:19:04,579 --> 01:19:07,288
I mean,
I understand our business inside and out,

1282
01:19:07,289 --> 01:19:10,000
and I'm telling you now,
there are signs of real trouble.

1283
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:12,920
Have you seen that piece about this being
a bubble about to burst?

1284
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:15,671
I don't accept babbling from outsiders.

1285
01:19:15,672 --> 01:19:18,509
Sure, but even some of our most
loyal collectors are getting frustrated.

1286
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:22,304
Complaining about overproduction
and oversupply, pleading with us

1287
01:19:22,305 --> 01:19:24,931
to be more thoughtful
about new Beanie intros.

1288
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:27,558
The collectors are idiots.
I hate the collectors.

1289
01:19:27,559 --> 01:19:31,855
- They're our bellwether, our engine.
- I'm the bellwether. I'm the engine.

1290
01:19:31,856 --> 01:19:33,398
Who's the billionaire here?

1291
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,568
You. Of course.

1292
01:19:37,778 --> 01:19:41,240
But if there's turbulence ahead,
you need me helping navigate.

1293
01:19:41,241 --> 01:19:43,115
Not some clueless hotshot.

1294
01:19:43,116 --> 01:19:45,284
Okay,
Blaine might be great at old-school sales,

1295
01:19:45,285 --> 01:19:49,373
but our value is online now, and I run
that. I run fucking circles around that.

1296
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:54,378
- Okay, I've heard you.
- No. Are you sure?

1297
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:57,735
'Cause I thought I was being clear
the first time,

1298
01:19:57,736 --> 01:19:59,967
so I wanna make really sure
that I'm being clear now.

1299
01:19:59,968 --> 01:20:04,513
I'm your right hand, Ty. Me. Maya Kumar.

1300
01:20:11,395 --> 01:20:13,772
You know how much you mean to me
and this company.

1301
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:17,609
I'll make it right.

1302
01:20:20,863 --> 01:20:22,155
- Good. Thank you.
- Okay.

1303
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:35,251
I looked into suing him.

1304
01:20:35,252 --> 01:20:37,921
It would cost every penny I have,
and I still wouldn't win.

1305
01:20:38,839 --> 01:20:40,674
Have you considered poisoning him?

1306
01:20:42,092 --> 01:20:43,093
Countless times.

1307
01:20:44,887 --> 01:20:45,888
I'm sorry, hon.

1308
01:20:47,055 --> 01:20:48,056
Doughnut?

1309
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:52,936
I think coffee will mask
the antifreeze better.

1310
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:55,062
And let me just say,

1311
01:20:55,063 --> 01:20:58,817
I couldn't be more thrilled
that this proud American company

1312
01:20:59,484 --> 01:21:01,277
is gonna take over the world.

1313
01:21:01,278 --> 01:21:04,280
Starting with the UK, and then beyond.

1314
01:21:04,281 --> 01:21:07,284
So, everybody, buckle up! Let's do it!

1315
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,828
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

1316
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:16,168
<i>They say good artists borrow
and great artists steal.</i>

1317
01:21:17,336 --> 01:21:20,130
<i>And Ty was the greatest
bullshit artist around.</i>

1318
01:21:21,673 --> 01:21:23,133
Robbie, baby. There you are.

1319
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:26,720
I've been looking for you.

1320
01:21:30,516 --> 01:21:31,642
Hope you're not too mad.

1321
01:21:32,768 --> 01:21:33,768
About?

1322
01:21:35,145 --> 01:21:38,357
Foreign expansion plan.
My foreign expansion plan.

1323
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:43,403
No. I'm glad it's finally happening.

1324
01:21:45,072 --> 01:21:46,406
- Good.
- Good.

1325
01:21:46,907 --> 01:21:47,991
Good, good, good.

1326
01:21:50,536 --> 01:21:53,163
We have a killer UK deal in the works,

1327
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:57,584
and our distribution partners
are raring to go.

1328
01:21:58,210 --> 01:21:59,085
Amazing.

1329
01:21:59,086 --> 01:22:01,380
It is amazing, yes. I'm excited.

1330
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:08,094
Hey, the cats came in.

1331
01:22:08,095 --> 01:22:10,389
They're... Listen,
they're a different color than you wanted.

1332
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:12,391
- You wanna take a look at them?
- I'm a little busy.

1333
01:22:12,392 --> 01:22:13,475
Okay.

1334
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:15,894
All right, hot sauce.

1335
01:22:18,689 --> 01:22:20,357
Come find me when you can, okay?

1336
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:24,111
I bet that guitar looks good on you.

1337
01:22:24,112 --> 01:22:26,654
I... You...

1338
01:22:26,655 --> 01:22:28,072
You're a mind reader.

1339
01:22:28,073 --> 01:22:29,908
I knew you were gonna say that.

1340
01:22:30,742 --> 01:22:32,703
Come find me, okay?
I wanna show you the cats.

1341
01:22:33,912 --> 01:22:34,913
Okay.

1342
01:22:48,552 --> 01:22:51,847
<i>It took me a while to realize all
the ways hurt people hurt people.</i>

1343
01:22:54,808 --> 01:22:58,770
<i>Turns out, all you have to do to have
a first day of the rest of your life</i>

1344
01:22:59,271 --> 01:23:00,271
<i>is wake the fuck up.</i>

1345
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:04,067
...job's mainly the phones.
Four hours a day, plus some Saturdays.

1346
01:23:04,568 --> 01:23:06,653
- You said you're in school?
- Yeah, I'm in school...

1347
01:23:06,654 --> 01:23:08,946
<i>Roberta, sweetie,</i>

1348
01:23:08,947 --> 01:23:11,825
<i>you need to come tell me
which one of these looks like marigold.</i>

1349
01:23:11,826 --> 01:23:14,912
You pressed "Intercom All" again. And no.

1350
01:23:16,747 --> 01:23:17,748
Bye.

1351
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:25,088
Yeah, I'm in school,
but the schedule's not a problem.

1352
01:23:29,343 --> 01:23:30,385
All good?

1353
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:32,679
Mexico, here we come.

1354
01:23:48,278 --> 01:23:49,738
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1355
01:23:50,864 --> 01:23:52,491
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1356
01:23:58,664 --> 01:23:59,790
Robbie!

1357
01:24:04,837 --> 01:24:05,838
What's going on?

1358
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:15,722
Robbie.

1359
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:46,879
Oh, God.

1360
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,049
Okay.

1361
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:54,261
Shit.

1362
01:25:13,405 --> 01:25:18,368
Sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry. I'm so sorry. Sorry. Okay.

1363
01:25:18,869 --> 01:25:20,078
Just in time.

1364
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,208
You look cute.

1365
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,210
- Thanks.
- Stressed, but cute.

1366
01:25:27,252 --> 01:25:29,483
I'm already an hour late
to Ty's office holiday party.

1367
01:25:29,484 --> 01:25:31,715
I still can't believe he scheduled it
for the same night.

1368
01:25:32,216 --> 01:25:34,593
- Yeah, it's a busy time of year.
- Great job, Dragons,

1369
01:25:34,594 --> 01:25:36,512
- go ahead and stand up.
- Yes, sir.

1370
01:25:36,513 --> 01:25:39,556
Shake. Make circles.

1371
01:25:39,557 --> 01:25:40,849
Mom!

1372
01:25:41,517 --> 01:25:43,434
- They're all calling her a liar!
- What?

1373
01:25:43,435 --> 01:25:45,812
- What happened?
- Hey, sweetheart. Come here.

1374
01:25:45,813 --> 01:25:48,189
- What's going on?
- Drew got a new Spooky

1375
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:52,486
and the tag doesn't say my name anymore,
so now no one thinks I made it.

1376
01:25:52,487 --> 01:25:55,405
- Sweetheart, of course you made Spooky.
- Yeah.

1377
01:25:55,406 --> 01:25:58,325
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
Let's see.

1378
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:05,666
This must be just a...
It's a factory mistake...

1379
01:26:05,667 --> 01:26:08,000
- Yes.
- ...or this is a fake Spooky.

1380
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:10,962
- It's not a real one.
- And whatever it is,

1381
01:26:10,963 --> 01:26:13,714
- it's all gonna be all right, okay?
- Absolutely.

1382
01:26:13,715 --> 01:26:15,968
I'm gonna go see Ty now
and get this whole thing sorted out.

1383
01:26:15,969 --> 01:26:17,052
Yeah?

1384
01:26:17,553 --> 01:26:22,223
In the meantime, I am so proud of you.

1385
01:26:22,224 --> 01:26:24,142
What you...
What's this you're wearing, huh?

1386
01:26:24,143 --> 01:26:25,309
- A green belt.
- Yeah!

1387
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:28,564
- And I'm a yellow belt!
- Yes, you are.

1388
01:26:28,565 --> 01:26:29,647
Are you gonna celebrate?

1389
01:26:29,648 --> 01:26:31,441
- Yeah.
- Yes. We're having a pizza party, yeah?

1390
01:26:31,442 --> 01:26:32,692
Yay.

1391
01:26:32,693 --> 01:26:35,946
- Yes, we are.
- Yeah, well, Mommy's gotta go.

1392
01:26:36,446 --> 01:26:38,614
But, I love you. I love you.

1393
01:26:38,615 --> 01:26:40,492
- Love you.
- Everything's gonna be okay. Okay?

1394
01:26:40,493 --> 01:26:41,743
- Thank you.
- Call me later.

1395
01:26:42,744 --> 01:26:47,207
So before we go to this pizza party,
how about we burn this fake Spooky?

1396
01:26:49,293 --> 01:26:50,836
A little light arson, maybe?

1397
01:26:50,837 --> 01:26:52,171
What is arson?

1398
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:11,064
<i>You know,
even when you built your own ship,</i>

1399
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:14,026
<i>you still gotta protect it from pirates.</i>

1400
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:17,404
God, I can't wait
to be rid of that douchebag.

1401
01:27:18,989 --> 01:27:20,073
Which one?

1402
01:27:21,074 --> 01:27:25,579
<i>Here he is,
ladies and gentlemen. Ty Warner!</i>

1403
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:35,255
Hey, everybody! Hi!
Look at all these festive faces.

1404
01:27:35,256 --> 01:27:37,132
I hope you're all enjoying the party?

1405
01:27:38,634 --> 01:27:41,136
And I hope everybody
is enjoying the present?

1406
01:27:41,137 --> 01:27:44,096
- Yeah!
- Those little bears.

1407
01:27:44,097 --> 01:27:48,810
Those little bears, I guarantee are worth
$10,000 already on the World Wide Web.

1408
01:27:50,354 --> 01:27:56,735
Those little cuties! And as a holiday
bonus this year, everyone's...

1409
01:27:57,861 --> 01:27:59,071
Drumroll, please.

1410
01:28:00,531 --> 01:28:02,991
Everyone's getting double their salary!

1411
01:28:04,201 --> 01:28:05,202
What?

1412
01:28:06,203 --> 01:28:08,789
Double your salary!

1413
01:28:12,501 --> 01:28:14,670
Feel the energy of the room!

1414
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,465
Feel the energy of Ty Inc.!

1415
01:28:20,133 --> 01:28:22,761
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Merry Christmas.

1416
01:28:22,762 --> 01:28:24,638
Happy Hanukkah, whatever it is.

1417
01:28:25,347 --> 01:28:31,436
It has been an extra special year,
and we are an extra special company.

1418
01:28:31,437 --> 01:28:32,520
Yes.

1419
01:28:32,521 --> 01:28:36,378
- We're amazingly unique, as you all know.
- Yep.

1420
01:28:36,379 --> 01:28:40,237
And because of that,
we're doing amazingly well.

1421
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:43,824
- We are winners.
- Yes!

1422
01:28:43,825 --> 01:28:46,368
We create demand.

1423
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:50,122
And this year,
we're gonna move more product than ever!

1424
01:28:50,123 --> 01:28:51,664
Yes!

1425
01:28:51,665 --> 01:28:54,168
- Because at Ty Inc. you go big...
- Wait, what?

1426
01:28:54,169 --> 01:28:55,961
...or you go home!

1427
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:58,046
That's right.

1428
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:03,468
How fun is this?
Blaine's coming on board full time.

1429
01:29:04,303 --> 01:29:06,971
- There he is.
- See a lot more of me. Right?

1430
01:29:06,972 --> 01:29:09,641
So I can go all in
on new design and innovation.

1431
01:29:10,225 --> 01:29:16,273
I have loved taking Ty Inc.
from millions to billions.

1432
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:22,237
From the website to retirements,
steering the market, everything.

1433
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,824
And there's so much more to come.

1434
01:29:26,325 --> 01:29:29,620
We're headed for the best year ever!

1435
01:29:32,581 --> 01:29:35,750
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1436
01:29:35,751 --> 01:29:38,921
- Enjoy the party!
- Ty! Ty!

1437
01:29:47,513 --> 01:29:49,640
To think I actually believed him.

1438
01:29:51,517 --> 01:29:52,935
I'm sorry it hurts, honey.

1439
01:29:54,228 --> 01:29:56,939
Your problem is, you don't know
you're playing a rigged game.

1440
01:29:58,774 --> 01:30:00,191
But if it's any comfort,

1441
01:30:00,192 --> 01:30:04,279
at least you had the privilege
of believing in the first place.

1442
01:30:09,576 --> 01:30:11,036
Oh, honey.

1443
01:30:13,664 --> 01:30:15,666
You gotta come on a jump sometime.

1444
01:30:17,668 --> 01:30:22,798
God, he looks terrible.
Look at the bags under his eyes.

1445
01:30:24,883 --> 01:30:26,301
I've been looking for you, Maya.

1446
01:30:28,637 --> 01:30:29,721
I've been right here.

1447
01:30:32,558 --> 01:30:34,267
Don't be mad.

1448
01:30:34,268 --> 01:30:35,853
Blaine's just a figurehead.

1449
01:30:37,187 --> 01:30:40,566
You know you're always
my secret weapon. You know that.

1450
01:30:44,695 --> 01:30:45,820
Look,

1451
01:30:45,821 --> 01:30:47,614
I wanted to tell you, I'm...

1452
01:30:50,033 --> 01:30:55,163
bumping you up to $20 an hour.
Twenty smackeroos.

1453
01:30:58,542 --> 01:31:02,712
- I'm done, Ty. I'm through.
- What do you mean?

1454
01:31:02,713 --> 01:31:08,010
I'm not your secret weapon. I'm
not a secret, and I'm not yours. I quit.

1455
01:31:10,721 --> 01:31:11,721
Wanna dance?

1456
01:31:11,722 --> 01:31:13,515
- Maya. Maya.
- Absolutely.

1457
01:31:13,516 --> 01:31:14,600
Okay.

1458
01:31:17,728 --> 01:31:20,230
<i>I never imagined
just walking away from Ty.</i>

1459
01:31:23,275 --> 01:31:27,571
<i>But once you do, man, does it feel good.</i>

1460
01:31:41,043 --> 01:31:46,423
<i>The thing about Ty is,
he draws you in, wins your trust.</i>

1461
01:31:50,093 --> 01:31:55,724
<i>When things get bumpy, you just think
he's complicated, a little damaged.</i>

1462
01:31:58,268 --> 01:31:59,895
<i>You wanna keep believing in him...</i>

1463
01:32:03,148 --> 01:32:04,149
<i>until...</i>

1464
01:32:07,736 --> 01:32:09,655
<i>you just can't anymore.</i>

1465
01:32:25,504 --> 01:32:28,924
I mean, what's the big problem
with disillusionment, right?

1466
01:32:28,925 --> 01:32:33,804
I mean, who wants to live
in "illusionment?" Not me.

1467
01:32:34,471 --> 01:32:36,265
Hey, Maya. Have you seen Ty?

1468
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:39,935
Oh, Sheila. Oh, no.

1469
01:32:41,061 --> 01:32:45,983
I want so much better for you.
For all of us. It's...

1470
01:32:49,987 --> 01:32:50,987
You okay, honey?

1471
01:32:50,988 --> 01:32:54,157
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I will be.

1472
01:32:54,783 --> 01:32:55,783
Yeah?

1473
01:32:57,494 --> 01:32:59,538
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

1474
01:33:01,665 --> 01:33:04,918
Why did Ty change the Spooky tag?

1475
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:07,296
Is he...

1476
01:33:08,338 --> 01:33:10,841
Is he so insecure
he had to take credit away from a child?

1477
01:33:16,138 --> 01:33:20,809
You know, it's... The funny thing is, like,
all the ones with the Ava tag

1478
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:24,146
are worth way more
since he discontinued them.

1479
01:33:24,147 --> 01:33:25,230
Like...

1480
01:33:27,399 --> 01:33:29,860
But you know, it's not gonna matter
much longer, 'cause...

1481
01:33:31,111 --> 01:33:32,112
What do you mean?

1482
01:33:33,113 --> 01:33:34,907
Well, I mean...

1483
01:33:36,783 --> 01:33:37,783
Main bar.

1484
01:33:37,784 --> 01:33:39,244
It's all gonna go...

1485
01:33:40,913 --> 01:33:44,666
Okay, got a scotch and a chocolate milk?

1486
01:33:44,667 --> 01:33:45,917
Well, the scotch I can do,

1487
01:33:45,918 --> 01:33:49,755
but we don't do a lot of chocolate milk,
so it'll take us...

1488
01:33:50,714 --> 01:33:55,719
Yes, sir. Room 1433. We are on it.

1489
01:34:22,746 --> 01:34:24,081
Did you order something?

1490
01:34:24,082 --> 01:34:28,418
No. No, I did not.

1491
01:34:31,672 --> 01:34:35,425
Okay. I'll tell them to get lost.

1492
01:34:50,607 --> 01:34:51,775
You must be Sheila.

1493
01:34:54,903 --> 01:34:55,988
I'm Robbie.

1494
01:34:58,824 --> 01:35:01,076
Hey, did I tell you I bought a hotel?

1495
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:05,330
I'm sorry this is how we're meeting.

1496
01:35:08,834 --> 01:35:11,962
It doesn't mean anything, if that helps.

1497
01:35:14,298 --> 01:35:16,049
I just like to show him who's boss.

1498
01:35:35,777 --> 01:35:37,904
What the fuck are you doing here?

1499
01:35:37,905 --> 01:35:40,157
You are making a huge mistake, Robbie.

1500
01:35:40,782 --> 01:35:43,702
We... I mean, we belong together.
Who's that?

1501
01:35:43,703 --> 01:35:46,246
You followed me to Mexico.

1502
01:35:48,123 --> 01:35:52,836
Of course I followed you. I'll follow you
anywhere. We belong together.

1503
01:35:53,962 --> 01:35:58,467
No one will ever love you
the way that I do.

1504
01:36:01,011 --> 01:36:02,012
Promise?

1505
01:36:10,187 --> 01:36:11,271
Who was that?

1506
01:36:12,564 --> 01:36:13,732
Sheila.

1507
01:36:15,234 --> 01:36:16,235
She's lovely.

1508
01:36:16,902 --> 01:36:21,489
No. No!

1509
01:36:21,490 --> 01:36:23,909
What happened? What did you say to her?

1510
01:36:24,409 --> 01:36:26,870
- Nothing, really.
- Okay, good. If I have her call you,

1511
01:36:26,871 --> 01:36:28,872
will you just say this was work?

1512
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:31,583
What did you think it was?

1513
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,048
Robbie!

1514
01:36:39,842 --> 01:36:44,137
You're fired, you hear me?
You get nothing! You get nothing, Robbie!

1515
01:36:44,138 --> 01:36:45,639
You're dead to me!

1516
01:36:47,432 --> 01:36:48,475
Robbie!

1517
01:36:52,187 --> 01:36:53,230
Robbie!

1518
01:36:54,398 --> 01:36:55,398
Wanna swim?

1519
01:37:05,617 --> 01:37:06,618
Come on.

1520
01:37:11,582 --> 01:37:12,791
Okay, Sheila. Listen.

1521
01:37:13,834 --> 01:37:17,838
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, God. Wha...

1522
01:37:19,464 --> 01:37:22,259
My face. Oh, God.

1523
01:37:24,386 --> 01:37:27,222
Oh, God.

1524
01:37:30,851 --> 01:37:35,564
<i>President Clinton
asked noted educator Dr. Maya Angelou</i>

1525
01:37:35,565 --> 01:37:39,443
<i>to compose a poem for this historic day.</i>

1526
01:37:40,027 --> 01:37:42,696
<i>If we knew at the beginning
what we did by the end,</i>

1527
01:37:42,697 --> 01:37:44,113
<i>would we do it all the same?</i>

1528
01:37:44,114 --> 01:37:47,700
<i>...and Americans everywhere.</i>

1529
01:37:47,701 --> 01:37:51,287
<i>A Rock, A River, A Tree</i>

1530
01:37:51,288 --> 01:37:54,625
<i>Hosts to species long since departed...</i>

1531
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:57,961
Who are you?

1532
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:00,546
Maya. New receptionist.

1533
01:38:00,547 --> 01:38:05,260
I saw you on your way out a few weeks ago,
but we didn't get to meet.

1534
01:38:07,471 --> 01:38:09,556
Well, welcome, new receptionist Maya.

1535
01:38:09,557 --> 01:38:11,642
- Thank you.
- Let me ask you something.

1536
01:38:12,768 --> 01:38:14,061
Do you stand up for yourself?

1537
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,315
Yeah. Every day.

1538
01:38:18,316 --> 01:38:19,857
Is Ty here?

1539
01:38:19,858 --> 01:38:21,755
Yeah, and he's running
super late for an appointment,

1540
01:38:21,756 --> 01:38:23,653
- so he should be leaving any second.
- Hey, out.

1541
01:38:23,654 --> 01:38:26,051
- I'm just here to pick up...
- You're not welcome here.

1542
01:38:26,052 --> 01:38:28,450
- ...the rest of my things. No, I...
- Get out. Out!

1543
01:38:29,743 --> 01:38:33,622
- Did you get a face-lift? You didn't.
- Don't touch my face.

1544
01:38:33,623 --> 01:38:36,792
Do not touch my face. Out, please.

1545
01:38:37,376 --> 01:38:41,839
I should tell you, the foreign
expansion plan, it was a terrible idea.

1546
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,214
The UK is a disaster.

1547
01:38:43,215 --> 01:38:46,385
Oh, no. Don't tell me your door-to-door
preachers aren't working out?

1548
01:38:46,386 --> 01:38:48,636
Don't give me that.
You raved about the idea.

1549
01:38:48,637 --> 01:38:51,390
You said it was brilliant.
You said it was genius.

1550
01:38:51,391 --> 01:38:54,393
I don't recall saying that. Not to you.

1551
01:38:57,938 --> 01:38:59,981
You're a fraud.

1552
01:38:59,982 --> 01:39:03,777
And I will never, ever,
ever talk to you again. Ever!

1553
01:39:04,653 --> 01:39:06,070
Aren't you late?

1554
01:39:06,071 --> 01:39:08,907
I'm the one asking you to leave.
I'm asking you to get out.

1555
01:39:08,908 --> 01:39:09,991
Could we have security?

1556
01:39:09,992 --> 01:39:11,992
Your assistant said
you're late for an appointment.

1557
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:14,537
Ty Inc. How can I help you?

1558
01:39:14,538 --> 01:39:16,914
<i>This is Sheila Harper
from Oak Brook Lighting.</i>

1559
01:39:16,915 --> 01:39:19,417
<i>I'm at Mr. Warner's new residence
for our meeting.</i>

1560
01:39:19,418 --> 01:39:22,546
Yeah, I'm so sorry.
He's obviously running really late.

1561
01:39:23,463 --> 01:39:25,715
He's in the middle of something right now.

1562
01:39:25,716 --> 01:39:28,302
Well, I've been waiting since 9:00.
Does he need to reschedule?

1563
01:39:28,303 --> 01:39:31,138
Honestly, if I were you, I'd just bail.

1564
01:39:34,057 --> 01:39:36,810
<i>But we didn't bail. We leaned in.</i>

1565
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,609
Are we sure
we don't have any other options?

1566
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:46,236
I'm kinda new here, Ty.

1567
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:48,739
It's such a mess over there.

1568
01:39:50,741 --> 01:39:51,992
God, I hate this!

1569
01:39:53,118 --> 01:39:54,328
Okay, dial for me, please.

1570
01:39:54,329 --> 01:39:55,412
Yep.

1571
01:40:00,542 --> 01:40:01,543
Shut the door.

1572
01:40:05,797 --> 01:40:07,633
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Roberta.

1573
01:40:08,217 --> 01:40:11,678
Well, look what the understuffed
posable cat dragged in.

1574
01:40:12,679 --> 01:40:14,222
I think you know why I'm calling.

1575
01:40:14,223 --> 01:40:18,143
Listen, I need you to come back and
help me out. I need you to fix the UK.

1576
01:40:19,353 --> 01:40:20,353
No.

1577
01:40:20,354 --> 01:40:23,732
Okay. Robbie, please,
I really just need you, okay?

1578
01:40:24,316 --> 01:40:25,984
Why would you need me, Ty?

1579
01:40:29,530 --> 01:40:31,823
Because I can't do it without you.

1580
01:40:33,116 --> 01:40:34,450
<i>I'm sorry, what was that?</i>

1581
01:40:34,451 --> 01:40:37,079
"I can't do it without you,"
is what I said.

1582
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,706
No fucking shit.

1583
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:43,814
But the answer's still no.

1584
01:40:43,815 --> 01:40:46,088
<i>What? Why? Why?</i>

1585
01:40:46,588 --> 01:40:50,717
Because I'll never, ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever work for you again, Ty. Ever.

1586
01:40:51,802 --> 01:40:53,178
But you can work for me.

1587
01:40:55,138 --> 01:40:58,308
- What are you talking about?
<i>- I'm starting my own company.</i>

1588
01:40:58,309 --> 01:40:59,809
And it happens to be available

1589
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:03,313
to be the exclusive wholesaler
of Ty products in the UK.

1590
01:41:04,982 --> 01:41:07,818
Wait, are you being...
Is this... Are you being serious?

1591
01:41:08,402 --> 01:41:13,699
Deadly. You want me to fix the UK?
Those are my terms. I run the UK.

1592
01:41:16,201 --> 01:41:18,161
Okay, I'm gonna put you
on hold for two seconds.

1593
01:41:18,662 --> 01:41:20,080
God Almighty!

1594
01:41:24,793 --> 01:41:25,794
God!

1595
01:41:29,131 --> 01:41:31,591
Okay, just get it fixed.

1596
01:41:31,592 --> 01:41:34,136
I will. Nice doing business with you, Ty.

1597
01:41:34,137 --> 01:41:35,429
Shut up.

1598
01:41:38,724 --> 01:41:40,184
<i>He got one thing right.</i>

1599
01:41:44,229 --> 01:41:46,273
<i>You gotta build your own fucking ship.</i>

1600
01:41:47,774 --> 01:41:48,901
<i>So I did.</i>

1601
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:54,031
<i>We all did. And not a minute too soon.</i>

1602
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:59,785
<i>The Beanie market
has crashed spectacularly.</i>

1603
01:41:59,786 --> 01:42:03,498
<i>From gold to garbage.
The Beanie Baby bubble has popped.</i>

1604
01:42:04,374 --> 01:42:06,502
{\an8}A veritable Beanie Baby apocalypse.

1605
01:42:07,503 --> 01:42:10,213
<i>By the end of '99, all that money,</i>

1606
01:42:10,214 --> 01:42:15,010
<i>$20 billion worth of Beanie wealth, evaporated.</i>

1607
01:42:19,097 --> 01:42:21,307
<i>That's the whole point of America, right?</i>

1608
01:42:21,308 --> 01:42:24,436
<i>Everybody chasing something
too good to be true.</i>

1609
01:42:30,734 --> 01:42:32,402
<i>And there's always another hustle.</i>

1610
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:36,865
{\an8}<i>Always a next new thing.</i>

1611
01:42:40,202 --> 01:42:41,954
<i>There's always another player.</i>

1612
01:42:44,414 --> 01:42:47,125
<i>What you gotta do is beat the game.</i>

1613
01:42:47,126 --> 01:42:48,210
Maya-<i>san</i>...

1614
01:42:49,378 --> 01:42:52,881
We'd like to discuss something with you.
This card will be a big hit.

1615
01:42:53,966 --> 01:42:55,592
So these are our "Pokemans"?

1616
01:42:55,593 --> 01:42:56,884
Pokémons.

1617
01:42:56,885 --> 01:42:58,177
- Pokémon.
- What?

1618
01:42:58,178 --> 01:42:59,555
- Pokémon.
- Just Pokémon.

1619
01:43:00,055 --> 01:43:01,557
- Just Pokémon.
- Pokémon. Okay.

1620
01:43:01,558 --> 01:43:03,684
Just keep on poking them on.

1621
01:43:05,102 --> 01:43:09,606
It's so, so gorgeous here. And warm.

1622
01:43:10,941 --> 01:43:12,109
You should come visit.

1623
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:14,945
<i>And you really think
you're there for good?</i>

1624
01:43:14,946 --> 01:43:16,779
Oh, yeah. I mean, Ava's Spookies,

1625
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:23,287
they paid for the whole house and the car
and both girls' school through college.

1626
01:43:23,288 --> 01:43:24,996
<i>- Oh, Jesus.</i>
- Uh-huh.

1627
01:43:24,997 --> 01:43:27,082
<i>- Seconds before the crash.</i>
- Uh-huh.

1628
01:43:27,624 --> 01:43:29,877
<i>You really did get out just in time.</i>

1629
01:43:30,502 --> 01:43:31,628
In so many ways.

1630
01:43:32,921 --> 01:43:35,507
<i>You sound happy. For real.</i>

1631
01:43:36,008 --> 01:43:38,635
I am. You know, I really am. I...

1632
01:43:39,178 --> 01:43:40,846
Do you know I realized
what the problem was.

1633
01:43:40,847 --> 01:43:42,930
It wasn't relying on the wrong man.

1634
01:43:42,931 --> 01:43:46,143
It was, I don't know,
having the wrong man rely on us.
