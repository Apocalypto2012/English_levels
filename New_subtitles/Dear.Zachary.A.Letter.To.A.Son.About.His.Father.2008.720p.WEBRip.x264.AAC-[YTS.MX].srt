1
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:37,971
Charismatic.
Opinionated.

2
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,106
I'd have to point out
he was short.

3
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:40,408
But he was a giant of a man.

4
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:41,809
Really a good storyteller.

5
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,444
He was completely selfless.

6
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:44,945
Kind.
Jubilant.

7
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,214
Caring.
Devilish.

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,815
Laid-back, very approachable.

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,751
Can I say things that are not
completely flattering?

10
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:54,255
He had the capacity
to have the worst possible gas.

11
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:55,889
And he'd be proud of that.
"Yep!"

12
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:58,125
He wasn't a saint.
He was a hell of guy.

13
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:02,696
He was just so intelligent,
and, um, I'm gonna cry.

14
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,901
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,951
Why are you sad?
Why?

16
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,819
Oh, I'll tell you
about it someday.

17
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,756
Do you know who that is?

18
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,090
Andrew.

19
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,825
Do you know who Andrew is?

20
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,994
I don't know.

21
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,668
Why did Andrew get killed?

22
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,636
Because somebody hurt him,
buddy.

23
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,938
I'm an only child,
and I'll get around to why this

24
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,908
is of any importance whatsoever,

25
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,910
but, trust me, there's a theme.

26
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,145
Where were you
when you found out?

27
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,848
Melanie, who's on the
front desk, calls back and says,

28
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,451
"Kate, there's a policeman from
Sunnyvale on the line for you.

29
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:58,986
Do you want to
talk to him?"

30
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,355
And I said, "oh, yes,
put it through to the office."

31
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,424
"Are you Kathleen Bagby?"
I said yes.

32
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,426
"I've got a message here
from Pennsylvania.

33
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,060
"You're to call this number.

34
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,097
It's the coroner's office.
You've got bad news."

35
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,300
I said, "is my son dead?"

36
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,503
And he said,
"I can't tell you that, madam,

37
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,904
but you've got
terrible news."

38
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,039
I dialed this number
that he'd given me.

39
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,674
And it was a man, an irate man.

40
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,610
The coroner's office
was closed down.

41
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,313
There was nothing
he could do about it.

42
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,114
I called back
to the Sunnyvale police station,

43
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,816
so he gave me another number,

44
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,818
and then I got through
to Sgt. Krulac, and he said,

45
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,321
"your son is dead
under suspicious circumstances.

46
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:36,924
Have you got any idea
why he was in the park?"

47
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,462
I said, "my son is dead?
Murdered?"

48
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,431
He said yes.

49
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,434
And then I called David.

50
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,171
And I said to him,
"Andrew's dead."

51
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,741
And he said, "no!"

52
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,677
And I heard him throw the phone.

53
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:59,713
I called Sgt. Krulac back,
and I said, "we're coming,"

54
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,615
and he said,
"well, that's good."

55
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,918
Through that flight,
we thought we'd go get Andrew,

56
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,087
bring him back to California,

57
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,522
get everything organized,
whatever,

58
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,124
and then kill ourselves,
'cause no point in going on.

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,262
That was the first plan.

60
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,264
Obviously, we didn't do that.

61
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:19,633
She gave me the list to call,
and we started calling.

62
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,502
I came home, and there was
a message from Barbara.

63
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,937
It was Tuesday morning.

64
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,273
I was in the living room.

65
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,642
How many people got
a kick in the head from this?

66
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,378
Everybody always says,

67
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:33,080
"what would be the difference
if one person weren't alive?"

68
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,192
I came home on November 7, 2001,

69
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,094
to find a message
from my sister.

70
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,929
Hi. It's Heather.
It's about 9:15.

71
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,198
At 3:41 P.M.,
I called her back.

72
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,833
She told me to sit down.

73
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,407
In the original news,

74
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,077
they said,
"unidentified man in his 30s

75
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,179
was found
in hospital scrubs."

76
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,916
None of those words
described who he was,

77
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,019
and they could put them on paper
and make them true.

78
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,756
Nobody said, "this person,

79
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:19,259
this wonderful person,
was hurt."

80
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,194
We met in first grade

81
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,431
at St. Andrew's school
in Saratoga, California,

82
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,633
and I soon came to think of him
as my closest friend.

83
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,435
It was here,
in the San Jose bay area,

84
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:31,004
scattered across the suburbs
that make up Silicon Valley,

85
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,339
that we all grew up.

86
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,674
There was Chris.

87
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,909
Do I remember how I met Andrew?
It was second grade.

88
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,711
And Matt.

89
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,947
I can say without shame
that we bathed together.

90
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,314
Michelle.

91
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,150
He was the first friend I made
my first day of school.

92
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,151
Jon.

93
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,519
We met the first day of class

94
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,655
because of our names,
Atkinson and Bagby.

95
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:48,922
Olivier.

96
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,459
I realized,
"wow, this guy's pretty cool."

97
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:53,527
Heather.

98
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,062
Between the two of us,

99
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,499
we might actually be able to put
together a half-decent story.

100
00:04:58,566 --> 00:04:59,600
And there was me.

101
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,068
My name's Kurt,
and I'm a filmmaker.

102
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,470
I'm Kurt KUENNE,
and I play Indiana Jones.

103
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,238
He appeared in every movie
I made growing up.

104
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,740
We made a movie!

105
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,342
He loved playing bad guys…

106
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:10,477
Shut up!

107
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:11,745
Jeff, get the cocaine.

108
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,681
A's, huh?
You must be a smart boy.

109
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:17,150
…and having a free pass to smoke
and swear in front of his parents.

110
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:20,954
I will fuck you up!
Kiss my ass, you son of a bitch!

111
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,790
Christ, start the fucking car
and get out of here!

112
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,992
Fuck you!
Fuck all you fucking people!

113
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,027
I did not say the f-word.
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,896
Which was probably
kind of a cool release

115
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,865
for a kid who made eagle scout
by age 15.

116
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,300
Mrs. Bagby, having watched it

117
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,503
where Andrew was running around
yelling and screaming,

118
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:36,504
kind of went…

119
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,038
I can't really remember being…

120
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,540
… "oh, that's not my son!"

121
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,208
Perhaps you have
a different idea

122
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,177
that I got all upset about it.
"Not my son!"

123
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,179
And, eventually,
I even got them in on the act.

124
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,981
Son of a bitch, you little shit!

125
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,117
You're a pain in the ass.
You little bastard!

126
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,153
Does that give you the right to go
yelling about your penis on the air?

127
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,655
It wasn't always fun and games.

128
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,525
You son of a bitch!
Ow! Jesus!

129
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,660
I didn't hurt your hand, did I?
Yes.

130
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,562
If you knee me in the balls
again, I'm gonna kill you.

131
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,532
And I know
I drove him nuts sometimes.

132
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,067
One more time.
"Okay, one more time."

133
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:10,137
The famous "one more time" line.

134
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,573
If I hear him say
"one more time" one more time,

135
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,741
I'm gonna wring his neck!

136
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,943
Jesus Christ, Kurt.
What do you want?

137
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,578
No, no.
I'm just getting…

138
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:20,113
But despite it all,
he always supported me.

139
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,549
Kurt, another winner!
Yes!

140
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,151
My god,
what are you trying to do?

141
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,753
Give our genius a heart attack?

142
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,256
He even invested
in my first feature film

143
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,424
while he was working
to save for medical school.

144
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,460
Everything was perfect.

145
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,729
I don't know what happened.

146
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,131
We got bigger, and we got laid!

147
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,567
At his memorial service,

148
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,569
I talked with his med-school
friend Anthony, who told me…

149
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:45,138
One of the major
things that Andrew and I did together,

150
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:48,676
or that we had in common,
was photography.

151
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,744
I had no idea he took pictures,

152
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,245
and I'd known him for 22 years.

153
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,848
What else didn't I know?

154
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,884
I was never going to get
to visit him at his hospital

155
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,587
and see what he was like
as a doctor.

156
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,288
I would never be going
to his wedding,

157
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,924
where I would finally meet his
entire family at the reception.

158
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,492
He would never be telling me

159
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,995
anything I didn't already know
about him.

160
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,664
So I decided to make this movie,
to travel far and wide,

161
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,666
to interview everyone
who ever knew and loved him,

162
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,602
to learn everything
there was to know,

163
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,437
and to make one last movie
with him.

164
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,406
I had no idea
how many years it would take

165
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,408
or how I would even know
when I was done.

166
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:25,145
But the longer I waited,
the more memories would be lost.

167
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,980
So I started at home
in California,

168
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,449
and, as soon as I could,
I grabbed a camera and said…

169
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,751
Action!

170
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:37,624
How would I describe Andrew to
someone who had never met him?

171
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,628
The man never wore pants.
He only wore shorts.

172
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,862
Constantly!

173
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,468
Well,
Andrew was very good at pool.

174
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,738
Quite frankly, he was
a pool shark, is what he was.

175
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,406
Well, he had a good teacher.

176
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,747
When we first met him, he had
this thing with his fingernails.

177
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,682
Oh, yeah, he'd always
bite his fingernails.

178
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:04,652
They looked like they'd been
through a shredder. Too late.

179
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,263
He was probably the most
determined person I've ever met

180
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,666
about doing
a particular profession.

181
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,100
His mom worked in the business,
so…

182
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:26,439
We would sit and discuss
a topic like venereal disease.

183
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:42,022
He didn't get an offer
to come to medical school

184
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,691
at the end of the first year.

185
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,459
I remember
that was a big downer.

186
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,161
I think he felt
like he wasn't…

187
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,330
like things were
kind of stalled for him,

188
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,066
and he wasn't really…

189
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,302
He wasn't living
up to expectations.

190
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,910
"Well,
what are you gonna do?"

191
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,245
"Okay, I'll get a job,
and I'll apply again."

192
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:08,716
Okay.
That's problem, solution.

193
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,157
And then, of course, Heather
brought home this application

194
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,360
she had picked up from memorial
university of Newfoundland.

195
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,429
I had to go look up St. John's
on the map

196
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,731
when he got accepted there.

197
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,899
I knew, "that's over
in the east coast."

198
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,659
He's now engaged
to this lovely girl,

199
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,495
and he's gonna go
to med school… it was great.

200
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,797
Graduation, he was in shorts.

201
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,298
We'll come back to this.

202
00:09:58,365 --> 00:09:59,900
But before we go any further,

203
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,135
you've got to know
what happened…

204
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,904
the whole truth.

205
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,238
So, here it is.

206
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,879
A couple of policemen met us
at the airport in Pittsburgh.

207
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,782
Took us over to the hospital.

208
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,350
Bill and Clark picked us up

209
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:22,555
and took us over to Bacha's
funeral home in Greensburg.

210
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,691
And then he took us
down a stairway.

211
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:28,628
Gurney at the other end…

212
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,431
With a white sheet over a body.

213
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,266
And…

214
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,105
…went over to him, and
when we could see his face…

215
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:45,245
…I said,
"it's really him."

216
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,047
I kissed him and held him,

217
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:52,019
and Kate kissed him and held him
and kissed him some more.

218
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,187
Tears are dropping on him,
of course,

219
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,757
and Kate went to wipe
one of those away off his cheek,

220
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:00,827
and a…

221
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:04,464
A plug came out where he'd
been shot in the left cheek.

222
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,834
Oh, god.

223
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,377
She pushed it back in
and cried some more.

224
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:20,213
After that, I lost it.
I just ran outside and screamed.

225
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,682
I was so fucking mad,
I couldn't see straight.

226
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,953
God damn it, I hated.
I've never hated like that.

227
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,421
Didn't even know who I hated.
Didn't know who it was then.

228
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:31,758
Just knew that somebody
purposely put him there.

229
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,760
Whoever that is is a monster.

230
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,862
Well, who hurt him?

231
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,865
A very bad person.

232
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,068
Which bad person?

233
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:44,704
A lady?

234
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,639
Mm-hmm.

235
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,275
What's her name?

236
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,110
Shirley.

237
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,479
Shirley?

238
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,747
Why'd she kill him?

239
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:04,357
I couldn't figure out who
she was in relation to Andrew,

240
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,394
since Andrew talked a lot
about women

241
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,129
but never really mentioned her.

242
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,064
Collette,
this is Bagby's new girlfriend.

243
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,632
Makes me sick to my stomach now,

244
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,036
but I was so excited
that he was dating somebody.

245
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,371
Come on, Shirley.
Get out from behind him.

246
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:19,906
I knew he'd been struggling

247
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,675
with me moving on
and dating other people.

248
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,145
Or maybe you will.
You already met me!

249
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,914
I was excited at the thought
that maybe he had found somebody

250
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:32,920
that he, you know,
could really be happy with.

251
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,455
But it didn't turn out that way.

252
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,664
Did you know her?

253
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,500
Yeah.

254
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,769
Do you remember
when they started dating?

255
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,171
Mm-hmm.

256
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,572
She just kind of appeared,

257
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,308
and then she was there
all the time all of a sudden.

258
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,811
And just didn't seem suited
for him.

259
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,585
He did say that there was
a considerable age difference.

260
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,587
And then the second time
I heard him talk about it,

261
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,656
he actually fessed
to the age difference,

262
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,058
and I was like, "holy shit!"

263
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:16,029
Shirley's got three kids!
Whoo-hoo!

264
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,268
Me, I always had to give him
a hard time,

265
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,802
so I'd tease him
about nailing grandma.

266
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,505
And she seemed so incongruous

267
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,540
with who
I would picture him with.

268
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,809
A person like that isn't just,
like, completely normal

269
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,245
and then, one day,
they become a psycho, you know?

270
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,746
I mean,
there had to be some signs.

271
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,283
She'd just be really
inappropriate with things.

272
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,019
Poor taste,
things that she would say.

273
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,621
She was always making
sexually inappropriate comments.

274
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,290
But never threatening.

275
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,525
We never thought of her
as being threatening,

276
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,594
but, just,
something was a little off.

277
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,996
Something wasn't right.

278
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,430
She started calling me
on a regular basis.

279
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,864
She talked forever.

280
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,635
Crude things about
their intimate relationship.

281
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,504
But I thought it was kind of odd
when I met her

282
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,006
that she was not practicing.

283
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:02,575
She had finished residency
for quite some time,

284
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,145
and yet she was having trouble
getting her credentials.

285
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,914
Nobody said anything
'cause we all respected Andrew.

286
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:11,551
And if he wasn't putting the
pieces together or something,

287
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,154
it just makes me think
he was just not caring.

288
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16,356
He was likely 4,000 miles away

289
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:19,025
from where he wanted to be
for the rest of his life.

290
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,261
He had had a very difficult,

291
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,264
kind of heartbreaking type
of situation with Heather.

292
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:25,932
Whatever happened
with their breakup

293
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,534
really kind of devastated him

294
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,938
and just left him vulnerable
to someone like Shirley.

295
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,040
"Andrew!

296
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,242
You know you can do
a lot better."

297
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,277
He said,
"ah, no, I really can't."

298
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,046
He'd poke fun at himself
all the time.

299
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,914
He'd say he was a short,
portly little fella.

300
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,120
You don't need
to go out with a woman

301
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,488
because you can't
think you can do better.

302
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,789
It was a comfort.

303
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,359
And, in Newfoundland,
it was somebody to be around

304
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,660
and he enjoyed it.

305
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,433
Oh, it's just
a senior-year thing.

306
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,735
After graduation,
he came back to the U.S.

307
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:05,071
To do a surgery residency
in Syracuse, New York,

308
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,239
and he was miserable.

309
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,607
He hated it.

310
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,410
Shirley also decided to move
to the states to practice.

311
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,185
We were not very
aware of his year in Syracuse,

312
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,687
what a problem
she became to him there.

313
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,960
Was a real hard year for him.

314
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,829
There was really no time
for anything.

315
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,931
And the fact
that there was this somebody

316
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,533
that was making a lot of effort

317
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,668
to maintain a relationship
with him

318
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,305
and represented something else
besides the misery

319
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,440
that it sounded like
his internship was

320
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,875
was hard for him to pass up.

321
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,378
He pretty quickly realized
that surgery wasn't for him

322
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,614
and switched to
a family-practice residency

323
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,582
in Latrobe, Pennsylvania,
in July of 2001.

324
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,950
And he loved it.

325
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,220
He said, "when
you finally find that thing

326
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,754
"that you know is your niche,

327
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,224
it's worth everything
in the world."

328
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,125
And he now
wanted her to go away.

329
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,228
He did not invite her
to Matt's wedding.

330
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,563
Yeah, and she thought
she was going to be coming.

331
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,997
The morning of the wedding,

332
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,999
Andrew's cellphone
started ringing.

333
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,835
And he'd answer it,
and it's Shirley.

334
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,003
A minute or two later, it'd ring
again, and it's her again.

335
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,872
Andrew got more and more
upset with her.

336
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,409
"What is your fucking problem?"
And he clicked off the phone.

337
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,346
She left 30-some-odd messages
on his phone.

338
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,617
His phone in his house rang,
like, 30 times.

339
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,286
Then his cellphone rang
30 times.

340
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,355
He's like, "oh, it's her.
I don't want to talk with her."

341
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,924
Apparently, Andrew had
already asked Shirley

342
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,595
to accompany him to Karl and
Marci's wedding, October 20th,

343
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,230
before July.

344
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,532
He had broken up with
her a month before in his mind.

345
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,668
It sounds so easy, but it's hard

346
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,003
when you're a genuine person
who cares.

347
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,706
He didn't know
how to be a son of a bitch.

348
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,376
Shirley had been really,
like, all over Andrew.

349
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,844
Just acting possessive of him.

350
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,680
I said, "Andrew, hey,
do you want something to drink?"

351
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,515
And she said, "there you go,
hitting on the best man."

352
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:59,252
My jaw dropped. It had to have.
I remember going…

353
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,654
On the afternoon
of Saturday, November 3, 2001,

354
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,490
he broke up with Shirley
once and for all

355
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,525
over lunch at the airport
in Latrobe, Pennsylvania.

356
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,059
Then he put her on a plane

357
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,061
back to her place
in council bluffs, Iowa,

358
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,264
1,000 miles away.

359
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,972
I remember the
morning that Shirley showed up.

360
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,074
He said, "you'll never guess

361
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,911
who showed up on my doorstep
at 5:30."

362
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:28,348
And I said, "who?"
He said, "the psychotic bitch."

363
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,917
And I told him, I said,
"you know, Andrew,

364
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,086
"when I break up with somebody
and put them on a plane

365
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,055
"and send them 1,300 miles away,

366
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,124
"they knock on my front door,

367
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:41,228
I'm going out the back door
and I'm calling the police."

368
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,029
He said, "what do you mean?"

369
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,365
I said, "Andrew."

370
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,436
I said, "be serious.

371
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,871
"Nobody drives 16 hours

372
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,873
after you've just
broken up with them."

373
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,276
I said,
"do not meet her in private."

374
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,944
He said, "what can happen?"

375
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,112
And he said, "I'm gonna
need to catch up with you

376
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,349
and we're gonna have to do
some serious talking."

377
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,517
I said, "bring some beer.
I only live a block away.

378
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,252
When do you think
you'll be done?"

379
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,889
He said, "well, it's 4:30 now.
Meeting her at 6:00.

380
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,325
7:30, I'll be at your house."

381
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:15,495
Things people should know
about Andrew…

382
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:16,896
he was never late.

383
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,298
And you know what?

384
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,933
When Andrew didn't show up
at 7:30,

385
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,903
I knew something was very wrong.

386
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,406
And when I went back down
at 9:00

387
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:29,342
and didn't see his car there…

388
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,278
I knew something was wrong.

389
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,283
Well, let me tell you
the events of the day.

390
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,017
Andrew didn't show up
for morning report.

391
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,952
Morning report ended
around 8:00.

392
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,754
I went down to my office.
I called Andrew's house.

393
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,390
Hi.
You've reached Andrew Bagby.

394
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,292
Please leave a message
at the tone. Thank you.

395
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,466
Called his cellphone.
"Andrew, where are you at?"

396
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,301
No answer on either one.

397
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,337
As I recall,
we're getting pretty close

398
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:58,671
to 9:00 in the morning,

399
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,740
and Rhonda and I
and some of the residents

400
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,342
are starting to get
a little nervous.

401
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:03,676
I remember bill coming in

402
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,012
and standing in front of
the television and telling us.

403
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,847
One of the E.R. docs
turned to me and said,

404
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:12,218
"they found a body in scrubs
out at keystone park."

405
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,553
Dead silence fell over,

406
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,588
a heaviness
like I've never felt.

407
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,324
And eventually almost everyone
was congregated there

408
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,626
just waiting for more news.

409
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,728
Rhonda got
the call, and she said to me,

410
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:24,330
"they need you in Mr. Clark's
office right now."

411
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,367
I remember my heart pounding,
going up at damn near a sprint.

412
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,235
I opened the door,
and I remember seeing

413
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,771
three Pennsylvania state police
troopers in uniform

414
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,172
sitting in the room.

415
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,542
And I said, "you're here
to tell me about Andrew Bagby."

416
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:38,345
They asked for us all to gather
in the conference room.

417
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,513
And they closed the door.
He cleared his throat.

418
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,649
He just walked right up
to the podium and he said…

419
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,351
"Andrew Bagby is dead."

420
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,354
And I said, "well, hell,
you don't have to look far."

421
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,557
They're like,
"what do you mean?"

422
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:59,399
I said, "this woman was in town.
She was here."

423
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,906
I said, "find her, and I think
you'll find who did this."

424
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,820
A summary of the evidence
against Shirley Turner.

425
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,122
He was found on the
morning of Tuesday, November 6th,

426
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,957
laying behind his car
in a parking lot

427
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,694
at keystone state park
in Derry township, Pennsylvania.

428
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,396
A man walking
through keystone park

429
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,931
at 6:10 P.M. the previous
evening, November 5th,

430
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:35,167
had seen his black Toyota
corolla parked next to an SUV.

431
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,469
This was 10 minutes

432
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,705
after he told Clark
he was going to meet Shirley.

433
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:39,872
"Meeting her at 6:00."

434
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,341
Shirley drove a Toyota rav4 SUV.

435
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:45,612
He was shot five times…
in the face, the chest,

436
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,614
twice in the buttocks,
and in the back of the head.

437
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,849
He also received a blunt trauma
to the back of the head.

438
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,852
That didn't sound random.
That sounded like rage.

439
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,154
The ammunition used
was CCI .22-caliber bullets.

440
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,189
There were six spent casings
and one live round

441
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,025
on the ground beside him.

442
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,628
Shirley owned a Phoenix arms
.22-caliber handgun.

443
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,311
She had three lessons
with a firearms instructor

444
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,047
who said that at her last lesson

445
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,783
she was using
CCI .22-caliber ammunition

446
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,117
and her gun malfunctioned

447
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,954
and would sometimes eject
live rounds onto the ground.

448
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,028
Then she said,
"no, I can't find it."

449
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,871
Then she said,
"I gave the gun to Andrew."

450
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,807
She claimed she was home sick
all day on Monday, November 5th.

451
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,787
The cellphone records show
that a phone call was made

452
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,488
here, here, here, and here.

453
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,123
While she claims
to be home in bed,

454
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,358
she's making cellphone calls
from Chicago, Illinois,

455
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,895
at 7:08 and 7:10 P.M.
on Sunday, November 4th.

456
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,163
Then another
from south bend, Indiana,

457
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,765
at 10:19 P.M. that night.

458
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,601
Then another
from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

459
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,670
at 8:07 A.M. the next morning,
November 5th, the day he was killed.

460
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,338
She logged on to eBay
that morning

461
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,240
from his computer at his house.
And back again.

462
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,942
At 11:26 P.M. that night,

463
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,011
she makes another call
from Cleveland, Ohio,

464
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,679
clearly on her way home
this time.

465
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:28,581
Then another call
from Stuart, Iowa,

466
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:31,017
at 9:48 A.M. the next morning,
Tuesday, November 6th.

467
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,085
Then another once she got home
to council bluffs.

468
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,521
And this one's to him.

469
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,732
But when she realized that she
couldn't possibly be sick in bed

470
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,567
when she'd been caught
making cellphone calls

471
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:49,669
from Pennsylvania and back,
she changed her story again.

472
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:53,105
Then she said, "I gave the gun
to Andrew in the parking lot,

473
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,174
and I saw him put it
in his trunk."

474
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:10,790
And that clearly shows
if she did this, she planned it.

475
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:14,561
She is a manipulative,
deceitful planner of a murder.

476
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,564
In order to prove
her whereabouts

477
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:18,865
when she made these phone calls,

478
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:21,200
each individual cell tower
along her 16-hour drive

479
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,569
had to be manually checked,

480
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:25,004
which was a process
that took almost two weeks.

481
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,473
While the police were uncovering
this crucial piece of evidence,

482
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,941
Shirley left the United States

483
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:33,145
for her home
in St. John's, Newfoundland.

484
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,714
We were absolutely helpless

485
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,583
for the whole time
we were in Latrobe

486
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:39,819
after this initial nightmare.

487
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:42,822
The other residents
and Andrew's…

488
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,624
they're Andrew's friends now…

489
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:47,994
came in, sat with us,
brought us meals.

490
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,296
They had a sign-up sheet
at the hospital

491
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,733
to bring us a dinner
and sit and cry with us

492
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,403
and listen to us
and cry some more.

493
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,505
Great people.

494
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,274
The whole hospital grieved.
It was profound.

495
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:07,279
Just picture the masses
that just came out for that.

496
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,115
From memorials in Newfoundland

497
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,617
to California to England.

498
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,518
To St. Louis.
To Latrobe.

499
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,721
I'm so proud to say
that I loved him so very much.

500
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:18,124
I'd be happy if I had
1/10 the people care 1/2 about me

501
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,859
as much as they did Andrew.

502
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,982
I know at the point
we had the memorial service,

503
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,217
she was back in Canada.

504
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,353
She was there at the memorial
service that we had here.

505
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,421
She broke down crying
during the service

506
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,290
and sobbing really loud,

507
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:55,027
and, you know, I wonder if it
wasn't all just for a show.

508
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:58,230
And then fear at that
point for, you know, Heather's safety.

509
00:24:58,297 --> 00:24:59,565
She came up

510
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,201
and sort of butted one
of my friends out beside me

511
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:05,471
and said just awful things

512
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,340
and, obviously,
I cared a lot more about him

513
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,942
than he ever cared about me.

514
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,445
And I definitely
wasn't important in his life.

515
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,683
Got an e-mail from Shirley…
a horrible, scathing e-mail.

516
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:18,050
It was all basically,

517
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,152
I was nothing,
and she was everything.

518
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:23,355
How wonderful their love was
and how that'll never die now.

519
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:25,357
To try to lure her
back to the United States,

520
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:27,393
Shirley was invited to the
memorial service in California,

521
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,428
but she didn't take the bait.

522
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:31,330
So, finally, she was charged.

523
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,800
She was arrested
in St. John's, Newfoundland,

524
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,334
on December 12, 2001,

525
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:38,404
and was let go on bail
the very same day.

526
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,906
And then this flight risk.

527
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:42,174
It seemed to me common sense
that if she isn't

528
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,811
in the jurisdiction
where they want her, she's fled.

529
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,846
Crown prosecutor Mike Madden
did not even argue

530
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:49,048
against her release on bail and
instead entered the courtroom

531
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:50,917
with an agreement already
in place for her release.

532
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,384
Pending the next hearing

533
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,386
in the extradition process
to the United States,

534
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,723
all justice David Russell
required Shirley to do

535
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:59,892
was post $75,000 in sureties.

536
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,795
$65,000 of this was posted
by her personal psychiatrist,

537
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,130
but I'll come back to him.

538
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,397
Turn in her passport,

539
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,366
sign in once a week
at the local police station,

540
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:08,968
promise not to leave
Newfoundland,

541
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,870
and avoid contact
with these people.

542
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:13,372
And with that,
the government of Canada

543
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,474
let a probable pre-meditated
first-degree murderer

544
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,576
walk the streets.

545
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,078
I thought it was crazy.

546
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:21,447
Should never have been.
I thought it was insane.

547
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,015
Who the hell
is the system protecting?

548
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,384
I could not believe
this was happening.

549
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:28,788
But the most unbelievable part
was when we found out about you.

550
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:31,490
Kurt, this is Matt OETINGER.

551
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,826
I just got a call
from Mrs. Bagby.

552
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:37,329
The abbreviated version is
what's her bucket, that bitch,

553
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:39,531
held a press conference

554
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,533
and announced
she's 4 months pregnant

555
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,102
with Andrew's baby.

556
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,771
They can't prove it
until the child's born.

557
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:50,309
If it is true, the Bagbys
are going to sue for custody.

558
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:54,346
My movie now took on
a whole new meaning.

559
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:57,049
It was no longer just my search
for what was left of your dad.

560
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,919
It might be the only way you
could one day go back in time,

561
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:02,021
see, and get to know him.

562
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:03,856
This is a time machine.

563
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,792
Yes.
A time machine.

564
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:07,459
And I vowed to collect
every memory for you

565
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:08,795
before they were gone.

566
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:10,797
So, finally, I set off.

567
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,599
First, I would go to England to interview
your grandma's side of the family for you.

568
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,134
Then I'd return to the U.S.

569
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:17,469
To do an epic road trip
across north America.

570
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:19,872
I'd start on the west coast
of California and motor east,

571
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,008
stopping to interview all of
your dad's friends and family

572
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,175
along the way.

573
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,344
And I would keep driving
until the land ran out

574
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,013
in St. John's, Newfoundland,

575
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,715
the eastern-most point
in all of north America,

576
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:32,151
where the last living piece
of Andrew, you,

577
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:33,519
would be waiting for me.

578
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,387
I grabbed
a digital video camera,

579
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:38,157
a 16-millimeter wind-up movie
camera, and an old Nikon…

580
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:39,558
I have a good idea.

581
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,660
I'll go back in time
and stop you from dying.

582
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:44,864
…and set off on a quest
to bring your dad back to life.

583
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:47,333
And while I raced
to rescue your history,

584
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,035
your grandma and grandpa
quit their jobs,

585
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,970
dug into their savings,
and gave up everything

586
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:53,572
to move to Newfoundland
to fight for your future.

587
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:00,079
I met Kate and David
in the spring of 2002.

588
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:01,447
I'll never forget it.

589
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,482
They needed a lawyer
to assist them

590
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,417
in making sure that their rights

591
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:07,486
and the baby's rights
were protected, I guess.

592
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:10,056
I instantly liked them.

593
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,858
I thought
that it was so important

594
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:13,893
that they have a relationship
with that child.

595
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,495
Our lawyer Jackie
went to see Betty day,

596
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:18,697
an administrator somewhere
in the hierarchy

597
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:20,232
of child protective services,

598
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,569
and told her that we,
the Bagbys,

599
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:26,205
are concerned
about the safety of the baby

600
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:30,676
because the mother is accused
of a pre-meditated murder.

601
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,479
To me, I thought they were
very emotionally intelligent

602
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,083
in how they were bearing up

603
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,385
under all of this
incredible stress.

604
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,220
You know,
that was a Sunday afternoon.

605
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:42,421
The next morning,

606
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,891
they had to sit in the courtroom
and look at her.

607
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,961
When your grandma and
grandpa first arrived in Canada,

608
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:50,897
they were told,
"the law is slow."

609
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,298
And they weren't kidding.

610
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,666
February 15th… prosecutor
Mike Madden acknowledged

611
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,635
that the extradition request
had been received.

612
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:58,237
They adjourned until march 11th,

613
00:28:58,304 --> 00:28:59,538
when they decided
they'd reconvene

614
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,073
to select a date
for the extradition hearing

615
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,508
on march 25th,
where they decided

616
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,510
to set the date
for the extradition hearing

617
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,545
for may 27th, where they got
caught up debating

618
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:08,280
the French-versus-English
translations

619
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,016
of section 32
of the extradition act,

620
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,117
and decided to adjourn

621
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,252
for a specific translation
until June 11th,

622
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,653
a hearing
which lasted five minutes,

623
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,555
at which judge Derek green
said he wasn't in a position

624
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:17,957
to rule on the translation

625
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:20,826
and they would adjourn again
until July 30th.

626
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:24,063
And while they waited for
justice and for you to arrive,

627
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,199
your grandma and grandpa made
a new home and new friends.

628
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,935
They made friends
all over St. John's…

629
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,337
people in the legal community,
the medical community.

630
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,305
But here at St. Michael's,

631
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,508
yeah, they got right in there
and got right involved.

632
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,978
It seems like
they've always been here.

633
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:41,280
They have more friends in
Newfoundland now than we do.

634
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:43,282
Well,
it's a very small province.

635
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:45,684
The land mass is as big as…

636
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:47,753
well, maybe not quite as big
as California,

637
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,255
but not far off.

638
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:52,358
And yet we only have
530,000 population

639
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,460
scattered over that land mass.

640
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,096
You can't go anywhere
without running into somebody you know.

641
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:58,964
It's the oldest city
in north America.

642
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:01,100
It's a very safe place, I think.

643
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,801
The big drawback
against living here

644
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,270
is getting out of here.

645
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:07,739
The weather here is terrible.
The weather is awful.

646
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,142
We have 8 months of winter
and 4 months of bad weather.

647
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:12,211
And the other very consistent
thing that I hear

648
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:13,812
is that the people
are so friendly.

649
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,881
How would you describe them?

650
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:18,217
Oh, do you have an hour?

651
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,486
I was hoping you would ask me
about Kate and David,

652
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:21,653
who are very…

653
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,355
Young at heart.

654
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,823
Childish.
That's not the right word.

655
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,126
He's an engineer
in the truest sense of the word.

656
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:28,727
The guy likes pintos, okay?

657
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:32,364
Logical. Does things in steps,
logical steps.

658
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:36,068
Comparing Andrew as a
teenager and Dave as a teenager,

659
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:37,869
they're almost twins.

660
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,072
It was wonderful.
It was wonderful.

661
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:42,808
He always calls you
"mate," his father does. "Mate."

662
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:46,345
"How you doing, mate?"
And Kate calls you "love."

663
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:48,080
Oh, I thought she was feisty.

664
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:49,982
Like a little ball of fire.

665
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,950
She's so tiny, and then
big things come out of her.

666
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,585
It's great if she's on your side

667
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,654
because she'll always stand up
for what she believes in

668
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:56,822
and those that she loves.

669
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,725
They're a rare pair.

670
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,461
They were from the start.

671
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:07,033
In itself, it's quite a story,
their marriage, you know.

672
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,934
I was going to come here
for the two years,

673
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:10,636
then I was going on to Australia
for two years,

674
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,038
work my way around the world.

675
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,472
And then I was going
back to Devon.

676
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,040
And I wasn't
going to get married

677
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,042
because that was not on my list
of things to do at all.

678
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,144
I was in the Navy,

679
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,279
stationed on an aircraft
carrier, the hornet,

680
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:21,680
in long beach, California.

681
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:24,316
A guy came into the shop one
day… E.T., electronics shop…

682
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,052
and said he had two nurses
who wanted to go to Disneyland.

683
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,487
We were too cheap
to pay the fare.

684
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,489
Yeah, two cheap English nurses.

685
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,758
And I took the little one…

686
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,061
And left him with the tall one.

687
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:38,564
And, uh, they didn't work out
so well, but we did.

688
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,167
We went out 13 times
in the first two weeks.

689
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,102
And he could quote Shakespeare,
by the way,

690
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,703
so I knew it was all right.

691
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,438
Five months later, I'm married.

692
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:47,939
So we moved down to San Diego

693
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:49,475
and started working on a baby.

694
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,110
But nothing happened.

695
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:53,945
We tried to get pregnant
for a year, two years,

696
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,781
with no result.

697
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:59,351
At some point, they
mentioned that they might adopt.

698
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:03,789
And then, I mean,
it was like a miracle.

699
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,126
Coming to St. Louis and sleeping
in my mother's bedroom

700
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:08,360
seemed to make people pregnant.

701
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,429
And then, of course,
Andrew didn't come.

702
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,963
He was two weeks late.

703
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:13,665
Things people
should know about Andrew…

704
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:14,933
he was never late.

705
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,328
Hi. It's Heather.
It's 9:00 Thursday.

706
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,797
Shirley went into labor
around 3:00 in the afternoon,

707
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:47,399
Newfoundland time.

708
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:51,837
On July 18, 2002, you were born.

709
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,040
Shirley named you
Zachary Andrew Turner.

710
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:58,144
You grandma and grandpa came
to the hospital to see you,

711
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:00,212
but Shirley wouldn't let them
in the door.

712
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:04,550
The stood five feet away from
you on the other side of a wall.

713
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:07,253
They left a gift for you.

714
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:15,161
Well, your dad
was an amazing person.

715
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:18,029
You're gonna get
such a broad range

716
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,566
of different perspectives
of this guy.

717
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:22,634
You're gonna know
what his character was like

718
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,636
and you're gonna know
what fun he was to be with

719
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:28,073
and you're gonna know
that you can be proud of him.

720
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,575
I flew to England
to collect the memories

721
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,410
of your grandma's side
of the family for you

722
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:33,812
and arrived just in time
for a very special occasion.

723
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:36,081
Well, we're on the Eve
of my wedding, for a start.

724
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,350
We're just trying to fit
this interview

725
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,185
in between
all of the preparations.

726
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,454
Your dad crossed the Atlantic
to come here almost every summer,

727
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,723
but instead of heading to the
tourist attractions in London

728
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,724
like everyone else,

729
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,459
he'd head to the outskirts

730
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,795
to spend time with his grandparents,
aunts, uncles, and cousins.

731
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,864
He was a king to me, man.
Seriously, man.

732
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:55,033
And, in particular,
with his cousin John.

733
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,836
The main thing, I guess,
about being an only child

734
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,705
is that I get to choose
my brothers.

735
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,341
Others of you don't.
Sorry.

736
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:04,009
John, me brother, and Andrew

737
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,544
were born within a month
of each other.

738
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,213
In fact, I think
it was about 30 seconds

739
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,548
of the normal child,
"who are you? Who are you?"

740
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,783
And then suddenly, snap,
that was it.

741
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,218
We often said,

742
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,754
at least they would have
each other through life.

743
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:17,256
John would always have Andrew,

744
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:18,757
and Andrew
would always have John.

745
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:21,827
For me, kind of blur
into this haze of me and Andrew

746
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,863
running around castles,
country homes, gardens.

747
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,766
I mean, these fantastic
historical places.

748
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,236
And, to us, they were places
to play hide and seek,

749
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,238
buy water pistols,
shoot each other,

750
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:33,839
and then get told off
and thrown out.

751
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,574
The interesting thing
always was,

752
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,343
just like
the cultural differences

753
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,977
between someone coming
from the U.S.

754
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:40,512
And someone in the U.K.

755
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,880
That used to really bug me,

756
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,949
the fact that I knew he was
going to get "star wars"

757
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,652
kind of 6 months before me,
that was a killer.

758
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,119
'Cause, you know, it'd be like,

759
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:50,522
"don't you dare tell me anything
about this film!"

760
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,158
He was almost kind of, as well,
my kind of chaperone

761
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,761
into discovering the U.S.,
really.

762
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,763
You hear people discriminate
against a whole country

763
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,265
just in one fell swoop.

764
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:01,600
But I was fortunate enough to
know very differently to that.

765
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,303
I really Cherish that,

766
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:09,641
because it is my brother
that got married here tonight.

767
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,343
Bizarrely enough,
one of the things

768
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,712
is I always wanted Andrew
to be my best man at my wedding.

769
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,047
As I would soon find
out, he was in good company.

770
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,916
I had always wanted him
to be my best man.

771
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,285
I had asked him
to be my best man.

772
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:21,287
It just made sense
to have him as best man.

773
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:22,988
I can only assume
that you would have asked him

774
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,155
to be your best man.

775
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,391
Everybody grab your glass.

776
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,792
We're gonna turn it over
to the best man, Andrew.

777
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,060
Best man's a little bit of
a poor title for these things.

778
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,662
The best man's really the groom.

779
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,365
I've got to try and sum up
20-some-odd years

780
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:36,101
in, like, 2 minutes or so,

781
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,103
'cause, you know,
then people will start looking

782
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,506
at their champagne and thinking,
"Bagby, shut up or die."

783
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,912
I…

784
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:53,619
I miss him… A lot.

785
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:03,061
That I wish he was…

786
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:05,664
Here at the wedding with us.

787
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:09,100
That I'd just
like to just sit him down

788
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,903
and talk to him again.

789
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,040
Just to have him here with us.

790
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,843
I really believe
your dad was there that day.

791
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,945
And if we could have heard him
give his toast,

792
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,780
it might have sounded
something like this…

793
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,749
Why am I standing up here?

794
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,917
I guess part of it
I've already said.

795
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,220
We're brothers and I love you

796
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:32,424
and I know you love me and…

797
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:37,095
Yeah. I kind of need to
move on from that.

798
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,365
'Cause, like I said,
I'm a Bagby male.

799
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:42,368
We don't gush very much.

800
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:48,440
It made me realize

801
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,776
that it doesn't matter
where you come from.

802
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:54,480
You can meet someone,
and, literally, within minutes,

803
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:58,450
you can be closer than someone
you've known for 20 years.

804
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:01,186
And someone who'll maybe just end up being
a friend for the rest of your life.

805
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,554
And last question.

806
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:05,123
Is there anything
you'd like to say to Zachary?

807
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,992
Zachary.

808
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,694
Right.

809
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,499
Yeah, I hope to see you soon,
Zachary, anyway.

810
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,870
Jackie had been down earlier
in the day to file the papers

811
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:21,072
that we wanted custody
of the baby.

812
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,808
We finally went to court.

813
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,110
You mean family court.
Yes, family court.

814
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,646
You know,
they negotiated with her.

815
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:28,980
I think you know that already,

816
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:31,783
and what access they got
with Shirley, they negotiated.

817
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,985
We're coming up with agreements
with this accused murderer.

818
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:36,221
Then Shirley Turner came up
with something else

819
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,189
just at the moment
when it was all looking good.

820
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,092
It was like, "I don't
have to pay for my lawyer.

821
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,628
"You have to pay for yours,

822
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,063
"so the longer I can make it,
it's better.

823
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,432
You'll run out of money."

824
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:49,568
But then she finally agreed
to give us one hour a week

825
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:51,036
in unified family court.

826
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,871
Shirley delayed
your grandma and grandpa

827
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,305
from meeting you
for almost a month

828
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,875
and had them treated like common
criminals in order to see you.

829
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,710
She required that during
their one-hour visit,

830
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,979
they be fully searched
and monitored by a supervisor

831
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:02,948
while she waited
in the next room.

832
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,750
When did you first meet him?

833
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,585
Meet him personally or meet him

834
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:08,954
by seeing the light
in Kate and David's eyes?

835
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,722
I mean, we were searched
and everything.

836
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,458
I couldn't wait
for them to search.

837
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:13,925
I would've zipped off
all my clothes,

838
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,761
as long as I could get
into that baby, you know?

839
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,262
We went around the corner,

840
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,698
and there was this
overpowering thing.

841
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:41,286
We did not do
complete tug-of-war, though.

842
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,722
I just gave him to Kate.

843
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,691
No, no, no.
We shared.

844
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:46,958
We took turns.

845
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,293
The next visit, he was really…

846
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,497
The next time, he was dirty,
so I changed his diaper.

847
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,732
And that's when he opened his
eyes to just kind of look at me,

848
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:55,834
and that's when I said to David,
"oh, my god, he's Andrew."

849
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,936
I had seen lots of
pictures of Andrew at this point

850
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,738
and even pictures of him
as a child.

851
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:03,274
And I thought, "holy crow,"
you know. "There's no doubt."

852
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,044
We wanted more time.
So we went back.

853
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:10,281
And this time, she accused us
of keeping him beyond the time

854
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,618
so that he was distraught
when he went back to her.

855
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,521
She'd try a lot of manipulations
without thinking them through.

856
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:18,757
And this one was
a no-brainer, really.

857
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:23,795
If she accuses us of doing
anything wrong to the baby,

858
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:28,233
she's indirectly accusing
Maureen of being a slouch.

859
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,801
The supervisor.
The supervisor.

860
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,103
You know,
Maureen's not gonna take that.

861
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,139
So, she just didn't
think it through.

862
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,174
While your grandparents
and Jackie battled Shirley

863
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,809
for more time with you
in family court,

864
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,978
the law in the extradition
proceedings was still slow.

865
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,279
September 19th…

866
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,614
the extradition
hearing finally began,

867
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:44,115
and evidence
was finally presented.

868
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,184
But just as everything
was moving along smoothly,

869
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:49,087
Shirley's lawyer Randy Piercey
threw a wrench into the works.

870
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,089
Because the "authority to
proceed" with these hearings

871
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,559
provided by the minister
of justice early that year

872
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,727
had failed to specify
subsections Or

873
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:57,696
Of section 229
Of the criminal code,

874
00:39:57,763 --> 00:39:59,364
the authority to proceed
was invalid,

875
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,199
the 90-day limit to amend it
was now past,

876
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,468
and therefore all extradition
proceedings against Shirley

877
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:06,404
should be dropped so she
could get on with her life.

878
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:09,207
Judge Derek green now
had to rule on whether or not

879
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:10,576
to throw out the entire case,

880
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:12,578
which would take place
on October 18th,

881
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:15,280
which was delayed four days
until October 22nd,

882
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,082
where judge green told Piercey
to forget about it

883
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,984
and said they would continue
with the extradition hearing

884
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,285
on November 14th.

885
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,022
Meanwhile,
I came back to California,

886
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,724
pointed the Van east
toward Newfoundland

887
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,859
and set off across the continent
on my way to see you,

888
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,761
stopping all over the map
to collect the memories

889
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:32,263
of a whole spectrum of people
your dad touched.

890
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,934
But it was when I pulled
into St. Louis

891
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,736
to see your grandpa's family…

892
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:40,071
Are you the oldest?
Yeah, I'm the oldest.

893
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:42,908
Bob was the middle one.
He's one year younger than me.

894
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,810
…that I discovered
a very special place

895
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:46,978
where your dad
had left his heart.

896
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:49,380
Andrew and Bob
were very, very close.

897
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,617
To see them around each
other, you'd think that Andrew

898
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:54,119
had grown up his entire life
around Bob.

899
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:57,488
You wouldn't know that it was
a once-a-summer relationship.

900
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,058
Bob used to take Andrew
out and let him drive the truck

901
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,693
before he was old enough.

902
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,294
And they'd play pool.

903
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,796
And my dad was very good
at pool,

904
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:07,766
but then mack came along who was
even probably better at pool.

905
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:11,469
I would say he was excellent,
but he wasn't as good as me.

906
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:14,172
He probably still owes me
around $30,000.

907
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:19,410
Okay, mack is my
daughter Rhonda's first husband.

908
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,012
I don't know.
They just clicked.

909
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,782
I mean, they just clicked.
I can't explain why or anything.

910
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:25,450
Automatically my little brother.

911
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:29,988
That's the way I looked at it,
you know.

912
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:34,425
We just become friends.

913
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,796
This is our clubhouse
that me and Bob had.

914
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:41,066
And he used to love
to come down here.

915
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:42,768
As soon as he'd hit town,

916
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,736
we'd come down here
and just stay for days.

917
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,671
Dave and Katie and them
would come out.

918
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:48,707
Always have a big barbecue
or fish fry.

919
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:50,208
Get the Johnboat
and head up the river.

920
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:52,043
He was the captain.

921
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,880
We didn't even think about
who was gonna drive the boat.

922
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:57,883
At nighttime, they'd stack
up logs and build a bonfire.

923
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,685
And we'd buy fireworks,
you know.

924
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:03,254
"That's really stupid, me
checking to see if you're hurt

925
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:05,456
when you're gonna be
a damn doctor."

926
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,760
I said, "if you're smart,
you'll be a gynecologist."

927
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:12,463
Doctor came into the
room and said he had bad news.

928
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,802
He said that the cancer
had spread

929
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,705
to his bones and to his liver.

930
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,740
Bob looked at him and said,
"I want the truth."

931
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:23,709
He said, "3 to 6 months."

932
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:26,611
I mean, I can come
down here anytime I want.

933
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:29,580
I just don't have time anymore,
really.

934
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:31,917
I lost…

935
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,422
I lost total interest
in a lot of things

936
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:40,125
when Bob died, for some reason.

937
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:43,461
I know it was hard
on Andrew, too.

938
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,166
'Cause he wrote me
a little note, a letter.

939
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:52,337
Bob was very proud of him.

940
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,040
Imagine him and Andrew
are laughing at me right now.

941
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,913
Both assholes.

942
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:08,086
Are you sad now?

943
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:10,288
Yeah, I'm still sad.

944
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,826
I'll be okay.

945
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:16,427
Come here.
Come give me a hug.

946
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:19,130
That'd make me feel better.

947
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:20,665
He was great.

948
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:22,801
If there's anything I can do,
I'll be there.

949
00:43:22,868 --> 00:43:24,069
Well, we hope to see him.

950
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:26,071
And we can show him pictures
and everything.

951
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:28,039
We'd love to be
a part of that as well.

952
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,774
To share our lives with him.

953
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:32,677
Oh, how I wish I could be there
and pinch those little cheeks.

954
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:37,682
Zachary, you'll never know
what you missed.

955
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:52,798
On November 14, 2002,

956
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:55,500
judge Derek green declared
that a properly instructed jury

957
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,103
could likely find Shirley guilty
and ordered her incarcerated

958
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:00,138
in the Clarenville
Correctional Centre for women,

959
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:01,973
awaiting a decision
from the minister of justice

960
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,375
to surrender her
to the United States.

961
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,544
She always seemed to know
exactly when to turn nice.

962
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:08,579
And it was a pretty obvious time
to turn nice.

963
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,581
Suddenly, Shirley turned around
and gave your grandma and grandpa

964
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,717
custody of you for as long
as she was in prison.

965
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:15,854
We could stop in and see him
whenever we liked. And we did.

966
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:18,389
They were so excited,
it was Christmas Eve,

967
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:20,859
and, you know, it had started
to snow a little bit.

968
00:44:20,926 --> 00:44:22,227
The doorbell was ringing,

969
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:23,862
and someone showed up
with a present.

970
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:26,331
And then Alan Goodridge,
he was a professor,

971
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:29,034
one of Andrew's professors,
he showed up with something.

972
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,701
I don't know what.

973
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:32,370
And then, you know,
finally, I said, "what?

974
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:35,706
Have you got the magi
showing up at your house?"

975
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:38,009
We went to church
with them on Christmas Eve.

976
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:40,578
If Zachary got fussy, you know,
they would pick him up

977
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:41,913
and they would feed him

978
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,915
and they'd walk
to the back of the church.

979
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:45,984
If there's people that don't
know the five of us,

980
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:47,986
it looks like these are
the grandparents,

981
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:50,021
we're the parents,
and Zachary is our child.

982
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:52,924
I said, "we look
like terrible parents!"

983
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:55,093
He was besotted
with them, the child was.

984
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,363
You know, no one
could comfort him. Only Kate.

985
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,898
They were so happy.

986
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:01,666
But it wasn't
all sweetness and light.

987
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,234
You came with strings attached.

988
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:04,702
The reason we reached consent

989
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:06,404
and the reason
she reached consent

990
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:10,641
is if you reach consent,
you have some control.

991
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,879
We'd accept
a phone call a day from jail

992
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:15,446
to talk about Zachary.

993
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:17,782
Which the foster home
would have done anyway, see?

994
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,617
This is Aliant Telecom.

995
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:21,419
You have a collect call from…

996
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:23,054
Shirley.

997
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:25,723
You may press 1 now
to accept the charges.

998
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,425
Hello?
Hi.

999
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:39,704
Oh, my!

1000
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:07,132
Or "mommy with baby."

1001
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:51,576
We'd bring him up to the prison
for a weekly visit.

1002
00:46:56,781 --> 00:46:58,984
That was astounding.

1003
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:04,755
Imposition.

1004
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,624
Each week,
they would drive two hours

1005
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:08,193
to the jail where Shirley was

1006
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:10,361
so that she would be able
to see her son

1007
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:12,030
and to follow
the visitation rights,

1008
00:47:12,097 --> 00:47:14,732
because just as Kate and David
wanted visitation rights,

1009
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:17,168
they had to honor
Shirley's visitation rights.

1010
00:47:17,235 --> 00:47:19,170
And in the winter.

1011
00:47:19,237 --> 00:47:20,905
But the weather, needless
to say, in Newfoundland.

1012
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:22,307
The weather here is terrible.

1013
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:24,542
To make that journey was awful.

1014
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:27,545
Only Kate and David would have
done it, really, I think.

1015
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:30,681
Nobody else would have done it.

1016
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:33,551
The one guard, the one day,
said to Kate and David,

1017
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:35,353
speaking to Zachary,

1018
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,356
"Zachary, I hope some day
you will realize

1019
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:41,926
how brave and courageous
your grandparents are."

1020
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:44,695
Like, I think if I could be
a quarter of the grandma

1021
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:47,031
that Kate is,
I'd be such a success.

1022
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:49,767
You know,
seeing them with Zachary…

1023
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:51,802
Just to see the looks
on their faces, Kurt,

1024
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,405
when they'd have him, you know.

1025
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:57,708
You know, to see them so happy.

1026
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:03,848
And then, you know…

1027
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:05,950
That ended, didn't it?

1028
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,255
Now crossing
the east coast of the U.S.,

1029
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:11,822
I was almost to you.

1030
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,058
I pulled off the main road
for one last stop,

1031
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:15,460
a small-town utopia

1032
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:17,895
where your dad had spent the
last four months of his life.

1033
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:19,797
It was here that I would find
the only people

1034
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:21,599
who knew what he was like
as a doctor,

1035
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,401
just days before
they would graduate

1036
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:24,969
and scatter to the winds.

1037
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,538
Latrobe is
famous for Mr. Rogers.

1038
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:29,607
Of children's TV fame.

1039
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:31,309
Rolling rock beer.

1040
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:33,311
It's the birthplace
of professional football,

1041
00:48:33,378 --> 00:48:35,280
though some would argue that.

1042
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:36,747
At Strickler's pharmacy,

1043
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:39,150
I'm told that the banana split
was invented here in Latrobe.

1044
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:40,951
And Arnold Palmer.

1045
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:43,854
Mr. Palmer's a very
important figure in this community.

1046
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,091
This is a community where
people don't even lock their doors.

1047
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:48,426
Your dad's door was directly
across the street from the hospital,

1048
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:50,095
giving him
a 30-second commute to work.

1049
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:51,562
And I said,
"can I call you 'Andy'?"

1050
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:53,398
And he goes, "actually,
I don't like Andy."

1051
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:55,166
He said,
"you can call me 'Andrew, '

1052
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:56,967
you can call me 'Bagby, '
you can call me 'bags'."

1053
00:48:57,102 --> 00:48:58,903
10 minutes after I arrived,

1054
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,239
Dr. Bill DICUCCIO picked me up
to show me around town.

1055
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:05,243
His class, it was bill DICUCCIO.

1056
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,745
And after hanging
with bill for a short while,

1057
00:49:07,812 --> 00:49:09,580
I completely understood why.

1058
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:12,283
This is yours to
take with you in your travels.

1059
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:13,751
They were like mutt and Jeff.

1060
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:15,420
They were
Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

1061
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:16,754
Bill was just devastated,

1062
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:19,124
as we all were,
but especially so.

1063
00:49:19,157 --> 00:49:20,658
I think bill had spent more time
with him.

1064
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:23,294
And I know there was
a third-year resident, Clark,

1065
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:25,330
who was quite close with him.

1066
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:28,366
He was this surgical resident
from Syracuse.

1067
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:30,568
Being a former surgical intern,
that's a big deal.

1068
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:33,338
They're all about cutting, and
what we do is a bit different.

1069
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:35,139
It's more about people.

1070
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,641
I would say to him,
"now, you go out there

1071
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,943
"and you listen to the heart
and you talk to those people

1072
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,378
"because, you know, people talk.

1073
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:42,147
They're not just unconscious
all the time."

1074
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,515
Your dad also had an office
visit every Monday afternoon

1075
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:46,184
at the last place
he was ever seen alive…

1076
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:48,052
a clinic in the small town
of Saltsburg,

1077
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:50,755
a beautiful 30-minute drive away
through the country,

1078
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,624
past a lovely spot
called keystone state park.

1079
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:56,394
He was already,
just within a couple of months,

1080
00:49:56,461 --> 00:49:59,864
already getting patients to call
and specifically ask for him.

1081
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,866
Hi. I'm Dr. Bagby.

1082
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,734
People trusted him
when he walked into a room.

1083
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:05,403
'Cause medicine's
a little like being a detective.

1084
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:08,038
Has anyone else in your family
experienced this?

1085
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:09,940
When you think of people
who have passed,

1086
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,943
you can't help but paint
a rosy glow around them.

1087
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,379
More than half of it

1088
00:50:14,445 --> 00:50:16,681
is being able to get a story
out of somebody.

1089
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,749
It's not what's happening
in this case.

1090
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:21,252
I'll always be grateful because
he diagnosed my nephew's cancer

1091
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:24,222
early enough that he was able
to get complete treatment.

1092
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:26,624
He was really pretty outstanding
at this stuff.

1093
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,125
He was told
he may never have children.

1094
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:29,660
He just has a newborn baby.

1095
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:31,095
He always told me

1096
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:34,465
that he wanted to practice
in a town the size of Latrobe

1097
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,767
and be like the doc of the town.

1098
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:38,536
Know everybody,
know everybody's family.

1099
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:40,938
And we really thought
he'd found heaven.

1100
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:44,675
But we packed our bags,
went to bed,

1101
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:46,677
'cause we knew we were leaving
the next morning.

1102
00:50:46,744 --> 00:50:49,414
And we stayed in
the upstairs spare bedroom

1103
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,148
of Andrew's house.

1104
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:53,351
The next morning,
we saw him off at 6:30.

1105
00:50:53,418 --> 00:50:55,152
And as I say,
that's when I noticed

1106
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,021
he was blinking
for the first time.

1107
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,156
And he did that
when he was a little boy

1108
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:01,826
when he was nervous
or worried about something.

1109
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,329
Just blink.
Blink, blink.

1110
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,565
And I wanted to say to him,
"oh, Andrew, what's the matter?"

1111
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:08,766
He stood up.

1112
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:11,068
And I remember he looked at us
such a long time.

1113
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:14,071
But he came over and
he kissed me and kissed his dad.

1114
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:17,041
Then he got halfway into that room
and came back and kissed us again,

1115
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,909
and we went with him and he
kissed us again at the door.

1116
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:22,380
And then he got
across the hospital there,

1117
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:24,282
down that alley and just went…

1118
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,321
And he was gone.

1119
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:34,091
That was the last time until…

1120
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:36,093
We saw him dead.

1121
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,063
And I can remember
Andrew saying,

1122
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:42,266
"if I die tomorrow,

1123
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:46,471
all I want you to do is sit
and toast a beer to me."

1124
00:51:46,537 --> 00:51:48,005
Do you remember that?

1125
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:50,375
When his parents had finished
cleaning out his apartment,

1126
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,077
they gave me his last beer.

1127
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:54,679
We have one bottle remaining.

1128
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:57,615
We're gonna crack Andrew's
last Fuller's ESB right now,

1129
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,884
and Kurt and I
are gonna sip it together.

1130
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,719
A little toast to our friend.

1131
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:05,423
To Andrew, my good friend,
I can't wait to see you again.

1132
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:12,062
And then, of course,
the unthinkable happened again.

1133
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,098
They let her out of jail again.

1134
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:16,033
And we had to give him back

1135
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,536
on January 10, 2003.

1136
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:20,305
Shirley was out of money
and out of a lawyer,

1137
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:22,039
so she wrote directly
to judge Derek green,

1138
00:52:22,106 --> 00:52:23,508
who responded
through his secretary

1139
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,310
with instructions
on how to write her own appeal

1140
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:26,744
of his decision
to incarcerate her

1141
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,679
while awaiting an order
from the minister of justice

1142
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:30,147
to surrender her to the states.

1143
00:52:30,214 --> 00:52:32,149
I have a few friends
who are judges,

1144
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:35,320
and there's no way
they would ever have responded

1145
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:38,155
in the way that judge
responded to Shirley.

1146
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:40,491
She did and was let back
onto the streets by…

1147
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:42,593
Judge Gale welsh.

1148
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,161
Judge Gale welsh.

1149
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:45,530
Welsh refused to even consider

1150
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:46,997
prosecutor
Mike Madden's argument

1151
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:48,399
that Shirley's appeal
was frivolous,

1152
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:49,934
even though multiple
legal aid commission attorneys

1153
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,336
had reviewed her appeal

1154
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:53,938
and refused to waste their time
representing her.

1155
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,140
I knew that we were
going to be seeing

1156
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,508
Shirley Turner walk free

1157
00:52:57,575 --> 00:53:00,778
the minute that woman walked
into the room… judge welsh.

1158
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:03,848
She was almost fawning with
Shirley Turner, as I saw it.

1159
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,950
"Oh, Dr. Turner,"
she said.

1160
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,418
"I recognize
that you're not represented

1161
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:09,620
"but also know that, as a
doctor, you're quite capable,

1162
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:10,788
"so I'm going to run…

1163
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:12,723
"Dr. Turner,
I'm not trying to exclude you,

1164
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,725
"however the argument
would work to your benefit.

1165
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:16,060
"That's why I'm
particularly interested

1166
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,161
in Mr. Madden's response."

1167
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:18,596
I'd taken Zachary to prison.

1168
00:53:18,663 --> 00:53:20,365
I'd sat in that same
little room with her.

1169
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:21,966
And here I am
having to listen to this

1170
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,401
and the judge Fawn
on this woman.

1171
00:53:23,468 --> 00:53:25,370
And welsh actually asked
an accused murderer

1172
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:27,204
to promise she'd behave herself.

1173
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:29,206
"If I make an order giving you
judicial interim release,

1174
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:31,208
"it would be on the basis that
you would not attempt to flee

1175
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:33,210
"or hide or avoid subsequent
judicial proceedings

1176
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:34,445
related to this matter?"

1177
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:36,747
"Is that completely understood
by you?"

1178
00:53:36,814 --> 00:53:38,148
"Yes, I completely understand."

1179
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,785
And here are David and I
as if we don't even exist.

1180
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:42,553
And we don't exist.
They don't care about us.

1181
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,054
They don't even care
about the victim.

1182
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:46,957
She concluded that… This is
from her written decision.

1183
00:53:47,024 --> 00:53:48,593
"Dr. Turner's detention
is not necessary

1184
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:49,727
"in the public interest.

1185
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:51,128
"While the offence
with which she is charged

1186
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:52,463
"is a violent and serious one,

1187
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,599
"it was not directed
at the public at large.

1188
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:56,534
"There is no indication
of a psychological disorder

1189
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:57,702
"that would give concern

1190
00:53:57,768 --> 00:53:59,737
"about potential harm
to the public generally,

1191
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:02,440
as her crime, while violent,
was specific in nature."

1192
00:54:02,507 --> 00:54:05,876
She is saying, in effect,
if I understand that sentence,

1193
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:10,180
even if she did it, she's not
a danger to the community

1194
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,250
because she's already killed
the only one she wanted to kill.

1195
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:15,753
He's the one she was mad at.

1196
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,622
He's dead.

1197
00:54:17,688 --> 00:54:20,157
So she's not likely
to kill again.

1198
00:54:20,224 --> 00:54:23,961
And I find that logic
absolutely atrocious.

1199
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:26,431
Most of us do not kill people
who anger us.

1200
00:54:26,497 --> 00:54:28,265
We go kick a door,
scream and shout,

1201
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:29,534
some of us throw a punch,

1202
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,101
but we don't set them up
and kill them.

1203
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:32,503
You have here a human being

1204
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,238
who thinks they have the right

1205
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:37,475
to kill other people
who anger them.

1206
00:54:37,542 --> 00:54:40,445
And you still let them out
in the general populace.

1207
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:42,447
I find that appalling.

1208
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:45,015
She was again let go
on $75,000 in sureties,

1209
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:46,484
not one penny of which
had to be paid.

1210
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:48,519
And with that,
the government of Canada

1211
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:51,055
let a probable pre-meditated
first-degree murderer

1212
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,191
walk the streets… Again.

1213
00:54:54,258 --> 00:54:57,327
And they gave you back to her.

1214
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,365
And after that,
things got really weird.

1215
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:09,373
We went and wrote
another consent order.

1216
00:55:09,474 --> 00:55:12,510
And we agreed
to a schedule of visits

1217
00:55:12,577 --> 00:55:16,046
with 3 or 4 hours
three times a week

1218
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:17,815
and an overnight
every two weeks.

1219
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:23,521
We got them to let us have
more contact with Shirley

1220
00:55:23,588 --> 00:55:25,322
in order to…

1221
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:26,857
Pass him back and forth.

1222
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:28,926
Otherwise,
we never could have done it.

1223
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:40,838
Because we've always had to
arrange for a third party,

1224
00:55:40,905 --> 00:55:43,574
and then that third party
would be not available.

1225
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:45,610
And we saw that we'd never get
visits with the baby

1226
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,377
because she could always
find a reason

1227
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:49,179
that there was nobody there,
you know?

1228
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,856
So, this evolved

1229
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:01,291
into us actually spending
a great deal of time

1230
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,960
with Shirley Turner…

1231
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:11,335
…in order
to be around Zachary.

1232
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,175
What kind of things did you do?
Go to the mall.

1233
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:20,344
Go to the movies.
Swimming lessons we took him to.

1234
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,350
She came here, bold as brass,

1235
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:28,385
coming to be "in our face"
kind of thing.

1236
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:34,592
I had enormous fears for them.

1237
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:37,061
I had a fear that Shirley
would go for them.

1238
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:43,601
And they didn't seem to be
worried for themselves.

1239
00:56:43,668 --> 00:56:45,169
In fact, they said they weren't.

1240
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,810
That, at this point,
that they didn't care.

1241
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,783
Can you describe what
that process was like for you?

1242
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,454
Disgusting!
Oh, disgusting.

1243
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,331
But going up to the door was…

1244
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:21,872
Having to be with her…

1245
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:29,947
…was just nauseating.

1246
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:48,198
We religiously did not talk
about the case.

1247
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,016
She'd try to suck us
into conversation.

1248
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,417
Like, she'd talk about,

1249
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,219
"was Andrew's hair light
when he was a baby?"

1250
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:10,655
And we'd just shut up.

1251
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:22,833
I thought it
was like being at war.

1252
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,570
Nobody wants to do it,
but you got to do it.

1253
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:33,043
So, facing this bitch…

1254
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:41,285
…that's the price
we had to pay

1255
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,253
to make sure we had a good
connection with Zachary.

1256
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,026
He knew us.
We knew him.

1257
00:58:50,294 --> 00:58:52,697
So that when she finally
went to prison…

1258
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:57,067
…he'd have a smooth transition
into our life.

1259
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:14,451
I just feel awe about that.

1260
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:16,520
I can't…

1261
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,889
I don't know
how they did it, Kurt.

1262
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:22,226
I don't know how they did it,
but I know why they did it.

1263
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:40,845
And, finally, after
thousands of miles and memories,

1264
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:45,282
on a rainy Sunday afternoon,
we met.

1265
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,754
Hello, bud!

1266
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:50,821
Hello!

1267
00:59:50,888 --> 00:59:54,792
This is your uncle Kurt.

1268
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:56,593
Hi, buddy.

1269
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:02,867
He knew your daddy
when he was a little boy.

1270
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,502
It's uncle Kurt.
He's okay.

1271
01:00:07,004 --> 01:00:09,239
Is there anything that you
would like to say to Zachary?

1272
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:11,776
Oh, wow.
Without tearing up here?

1273
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,946
First of all,
I saw your pictures.

1274
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:17,948
And you are a very cute kid,

1275
01:00:18,015 --> 01:00:19,850
and you look
exactly like Andrew.

1276
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:22,787
Definitely the cheeky
Andrew face, definitely.

1277
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:24,388
Ah.

1278
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,456
Zachary,
you're a lucky little boy.

1279
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:29,293
And you're
an unfortunate little boy.

1280
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,628
Your father,
who you'll never know,

1281
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:35,065
was such an amazing guy.

1282
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:38,568
And he touched so many people
in such a short period of time.

1283
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,704
It's not just
a bunch of stories.

1284
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,840
He was a real person.

1285
01:00:42,907 --> 01:00:44,508
Don't let anybody lie to you.

1286
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:46,977
Wouldn't eat anything green
until he went away to college.

1287
01:00:47,044 --> 01:00:49,379
Zachary is asleep
in the other room.

1288
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:51,248
He's spending the night.

1289
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:54,218
And you're
an unfortunate little boy

1290
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:56,153
because you're more
than likely to grow up

1291
01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:01,658
without your biological father
or your biological mother.

1292
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:03,560
But with a little bit of luck,

1293
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:06,831
you'll get to grow up
with Andrew's parents.

1294
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:10,134
And let me tell you this.

1295
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,137
They did the most amazing job.

1296
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:15,839
You couldn't ask
for two better people.

1297
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,375
<i>♪ Grandma loves you, ♪
♪ yes, she does ♪</i>

1298
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:21,211
<i>♪ Granddad loves you, ♪
♪ yes, he does ♪</i>

1299
01:01:21,278 --> 01:01:23,613
<i>♪ Daddy loves you, ♪
♪ yes, he does ♪</i>

1300
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,250
<i>♪ Uncle Kurt's here, ♪
♪ he loves you, too ♪</i>

1301
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:28,886
<i>♪ We all love you, all we can ♪</i>

1302
01:01:28,953 --> 01:01:31,255
<i>♪ Darling, darling little man ♪</i>

1303
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:32,656
So, from that perspective,

1304
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:34,291
you're the luckiest little boy
in the world.

1305
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:36,593
They love you
more than life itself.

1306
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,930
And if you ever need anything,
I'm not far away, either.

1307
01:01:39,997 --> 01:01:41,866
And know that
we'll be there for you

1308
01:01:41,932 --> 01:01:44,368
in every way that he can't be.

1309
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:47,004
Zach, when you're
old enough and you watch this,

1310
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:49,506
if you ever want to
talk with me personally

1311
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:51,075
or you want to come and see me,

1312
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,377
you have an open invitation,
and you should know that.

1313
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,445
And you're loved and I love you

1314
01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:57,381
and I care about the person
you're gonna become.

1315
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,583
We love him, and we do simple
things like send him books.

1316
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:02,086
Happy birthday! Can't
wait to meet him.

1317
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:04,588
I hope to get the chance
to meet you.

1318
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,356
Oh, I hope I'm uncle Ken
to Zachary.

1319
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:09,093
'Cause if you're anything like
Andrew, it's gonna be good.

1320
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:11,495
I think you'll turn out
just great.

1321
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,263
It says "student
affairs." Are you a student?

1322
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,565
Who knows? Maybe someday
you'll be applying here

1323
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:17,067
to the faculty of medicine.

1324
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:19,904
Does this look exciting?
We're gonna do an interview.

1325
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:22,406
Even though
things started tragically,

1326
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:26,810
you know, he's the blessing
Andrew left behind.

1327
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:28,645
I parked the Van two blocks away

1328
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:31,381
'cause it was the only vehicle
for miles with California plates

1329
01:02:31,448 --> 01:02:33,417
and would give away to Shirley
that I was in town.

1330
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,052
Sort of a stealth Van, you see.
Exactly.

1331
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:37,454
If she knew, I was afraid
she would find excuses

1332
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:39,289
to withhold you
so that I couldn't see you.

1333
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:41,525
Every time the doorbell rang,
I hid in the back bedroom,

1334
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,393
as it could have been her
just dropping by unannounced.

1335
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,162
Hi, David. Hi, Kate.
This is Shirley.

1336
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:46,496
On the days we didn't have you,

1337
01:02:46,563 --> 01:02:48,765
I discovered your dad's
medical-school world,

1338
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:51,401
met his classmates, found
more footage of him for you…

1339
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:54,972
And, finally,
I found myself face-to-face

1340
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,541
with the thing that had set me
on this journey

1341
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,943
in the first place.

1342
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:01,445
One of the major things
that Andrew and I did together,

1343
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:05,015
or that we had in common,
was photography.

1344
01:03:05,082 --> 01:03:07,784
Sometimes
we'd bring the cameras out

1345
01:03:07,851 --> 01:03:10,154
and go around the lake
and by the pond,

1346
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,089
and take some pictures
around there.

1347
01:03:12,156 --> 01:03:14,291
I told Andrew,
"listen, you're gonna have to

1348
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:15,725
"show me a few tricks
or whatever

1349
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,261
and show me
some of your pictures."

1350
01:03:17,327 --> 01:03:19,129
I'd still love to see
some of the pictures

1351
01:03:19,196 --> 01:03:20,797
that he took
through medical school.

1352
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:23,267
I've never seen any of them.

1353
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:45,689
Him and his dad had done
quite a bit of photography together.

1354
01:03:45,755 --> 01:03:47,757
Right after this
happened, I fired out an e-mail

1355
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:51,861
saying we should try to think
of some sort of memorial award.

1356
01:03:51,996 --> 01:03:54,198
And I felt like
that would be something also

1357
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:56,866
that his dad would really
feel honored by.

1358
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:59,403
And then have a wall
in the medical school.

1359
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:01,871
To be able to say
year after year, you know,

1360
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:04,007
these are the winners,
and people could look

1361
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,842
and be like,
"wow," you know, "look at this."

1362
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:08,912
I have a meeting tomorrow
to participate in the judging.

1363
01:04:09,013 --> 01:04:10,347
And I find it interesting

1364
01:04:10,414 --> 01:04:12,616
that you say
that you hadn't heard that.

1365
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,017
I wonder if part of it

1366
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:16,653
was eventually maybe have
his dad independently say,

1367
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,255
"oh, who took this picture?

1368
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:19,923
It's a really nice picture."

1369
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:22,559
And have him say, "oh, me!"
I don't know.

1370
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:24,328
But it's something he did.

1371
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:29,066
On July 18, 2003,
you turned one.

1372
01:04:33,137 --> 01:04:36,173
Shirley decided to hold a birthday
party for you at McDonald's.

1373
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,242
She started to open presents.

1374
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:39,776
Well, he wasn't interested
in presents.

1375
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:41,045
He wanted to get down.

1376
01:04:41,078 --> 01:04:44,581
So, when he got down,
he made for me.

1377
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:47,584
Shirley was very, very angry.

1378
01:04:47,651 --> 01:04:50,254
So, she said,
"he loves you more than me.

1379
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,821
Why don't you take him?"

1380
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:05,335
Zachary always,
from the time he could choose,

1381
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,937
would choose Kate over her.

1382
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:10,874
That was obvious, and
other people talked about it.

1383
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:14,611
Kate is a warm
and loving mother.

1384
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:17,080
She was a phony mother.

1385
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:18,415
I love you.

1386
01:05:18,482 --> 01:05:20,217
Mommy loves you.
Yes, I do.

1387
01:05:20,284 --> 01:05:22,919
She knew the motions,
but there's no warmth in it.

1388
01:05:22,986 --> 01:05:24,654
Zachary.
I love you, baby.

1389
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:26,156
Mommy loves you.
Mommy loves you.

1390
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:27,791
She said that she had kids

1391
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,859
and that she wasn't interested
in living with them, either.

1392
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,096
She kind of went off to
medical school and left them.

1393
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:33,897
And she said that they lived
with their fathers,

1394
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:37,000
and that children were more
trouble than they were worth.

1395
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:38,735
I believe she's
using her own children now

1396
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:40,737
to manipulate the system

1397
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:43,173
and to make Kate and David
suffer,

1398
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,175
even if she goes to jail.

1399
01:05:45,242 --> 01:05:46,910
Fortunately,
there are enough people here

1400
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:49,946
who are in the system,
the justice system,

1401
01:05:50,013 --> 01:05:51,548
the child-protection system,

1402
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,117
that I know personally

1403
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:56,786
who have told me that
that will not happen.

1404
01:05:56,853 --> 01:05:58,755
The next hearing
in the extradition process

1405
01:05:58,822 --> 01:06:01,925
was set for September 25th,
your dad's 30th birthday,

1406
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:03,827
where she would likely be
re-incarcerated

1407
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:05,995
and at last returned to the U.S.
for trial.

1408
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:09,466
But, for now, it was time
for me to go home.

1409
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:11,801
I have to say bye-bye now.
Gonna say "bye-bye"?

1410
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:13,137
Bye-bye to uncle Kurt?

1411
01:06:13,203 --> 01:06:14,538
You gonna give him a hug?

1412
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:16,806
Can I have a hug?

1413
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:19,676
Pbht!

1414
01:06:19,743 --> 01:06:21,611
Was that funny?
Was that funny?

1415
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:24,514
Bye-bye, sweet pea.
I'll see you later, buddy.

1416
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:27,651
Well, you'll be a little bigger
next time I see you.

1417
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:30,287
He had just completed
the child health checks they do.

1418
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:32,489
He's ahead of his time.
He's doing great.

1419
01:06:32,556 --> 01:06:34,023
He's up to par on everything,

1420
01:06:34,158 --> 01:06:36,193
but he doesn't like
to wave goodbye.

1421
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:38,495
Bye-bye!
Bye-bye!

1422
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:41,165
One of them said, "that's fine,

1423
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:42,999
'cause he's got lots of time
to learn that."

1424
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:44,834
Is there anything
you'd like to say to Zachary?

1425
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:48,037
I'm hoping I'm gonna have all
the opportunity to say those things.

1426
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:54,077
We had been out.
We came back here.

1427
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:58,882
There was a little card
in the door from constable Walsh

1428
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:01,084
saying, would we contact him?

1429
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:02,519
I was here.
Mark and I were here.

1430
01:07:02,586 --> 01:07:04,521
I was at my house.

1431
01:07:04,588 --> 01:07:06,856
I was home watching
the 6:00 NTV news.

1432
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:10,327
And the next thing, I saw a
picture of Shirley and Zachary

1433
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:12,829
and saying
that they were missing.

1434
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:15,499
And I was just screaming
at the top of my lungs.

1435
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:17,201
And I immediately fell
to the floor.

1436
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,102
So I immediately went over
to their apartment.

1437
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:20,237
We came here.

1438
01:07:20,304 --> 01:07:22,005
So we got in the car
and went over there.

1439
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:24,341
I'll never forget that moment.

1440
01:07:24,408 --> 01:07:25,642
They're gonna be okay.

1441
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:27,211
You're overreacting.
You're gonna think the worst.

1442
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:28,978
She's probably gone for a night.

1443
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,680
My first thought
was that she had left.

1444
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:32,015
She had taken him and run.

1445
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,050
She couldn't do that.
She couldn't possibly do that.

1446
01:07:34,117 --> 01:07:35,852
That was about 2 or 3 hours
of uncertainty.

1447
01:07:35,919 --> 01:07:37,621
The emotion was overwhelming.

1448
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:43,627
They called told us
they were doing a search

1449
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:45,695
of the beach
out in conception bay south.

1450
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:48,365
I thought, "they're doing that
for a reason."

1451
01:07:48,432 --> 01:07:50,967
"We're having a press conference
on the Turner case."

1452
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:53,903
I went to father Chris, I just whispered
to him, "I think you better stay,

1453
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:56,806
because I think I'm gonna be
back with some really bad news."

1454
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:59,676
He told me
that they had found a baby…

1455
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:01,245
Along with an adult.

1456
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:03,046
I knew then
that there was two bodies.

1457
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:06,383
"They're working
to identify the bodies."

1458
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:09,386
We came to the door, and it
was Jackie and constable Walsh.

1459
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:10,720
I thought, "oh, my gosh,

1460
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:12,889
somebody's with them now
trying to tell them."

1461
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:14,624
We went in, and I told them.

1462
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:20,430
And what I saw after that
I will never forget in my life.

1463
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:28,638
Rage.
Absolute vicious rage.

1464
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:31,007
Someone has done that
to someone you love.

1465
01:08:31,074 --> 01:08:33,410
If the person who did this
had been here, I'd kill them.

1466
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:37,414
Period.
No questions. Kill them!

1467
01:08:37,481 --> 01:08:39,449
Strangle that fucking bitch
right here, right now!

1468
01:08:39,516 --> 01:08:41,184
Period.
No questions. Kill them!

1469
01:08:49,293 --> 01:08:51,795
And then we went to
have to identify him,

1470
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,530
and we couldn't touch him

1471
01:08:53,597 --> 01:08:56,099
because they said
he was forensic.

1472
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:58,735
He hadn't been
through the autopsy yet.

1473
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:00,437
There's this table

1474
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:02,806
and sort of white sheets up
all around him.

1475
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:04,708
With a white sheet over a body.

1476
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:06,910
You could see over the sheets,
clearly, it was him.

1477
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,347
It's really him.

1478
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:14,351
And then Kate's legs quit.

1479
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:16,320
She just went
straight to the floor.

1480
01:09:16,353 --> 01:09:19,689
David was lying
on top of Kate on the floor.

1481
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:22,626
We managed to get them out. I
don't know how we did it, Kurt.

1482
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:25,495
I don't know
how I got out myself.

1483
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:28,698
That poor little baby.

1484
01:09:28,765 --> 01:09:31,368
A summary of the evidence
against Shirley Turner.

1485
01:09:31,435 --> 01:09:33,169
Part two.

1486
01:09:33,236 --> 01:09:35,672
In July of 2003,
Shirley met a man at a bar

1487
01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:37,341
in downtown St. John's.

1488
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,676
They went out twice until his friends
showed him articles on the web

1489
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:42,412
saying she was accused
of killing her last boyfriend.

1490
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,348
He told her he didn't
want to see her anymore.

1491
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:46,983
She then called and left over
200 messages on his phone,

1492
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,853
including one saying that she was
pregnant and that he needed to…

1493
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:51,921
Step up to the plate
and be a fucking man.

1494
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:53,557
She wasn't,
as her autopsy showed.

1495
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:55,859
The night she killed you,
she made a phony phone call

1496
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,761
from her apartment
to a friend's answering machine,

1497
01:09:57,827 --> 01:09:59,529
claiming to be
at this man's house with you.

1498
01:09:59,596 --> 01:10:02,366
She took your brother T.J.'s car
at about 11:38 that night

1499
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:03,767
and drove to the man's house.

1500
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:05,101
She got lost along the way

1501
01:10:05,168 --> 01:10:07,337
and asked a woman for directions
along this road

1502
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:08,705
around 12:45 A.M.

1503
01:10:08,772 --> 01:10:10,139
She parked behind his house,

1504
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,208
left a used tampon and photos of
the two of you on his property,

1505
01:10:12,275 --> 01:10:13,943
completing her attempt

1506
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:16,346
to frame this man
for what she was about to do,

1507
01:10:16,413 --> 01:10:18,515
then took you down to the ocean
behind his home.

1508
01:10:18,582 --> 01:10:20,584
A night watchman in the area
thought he heard a baby

1509
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:22,218
crying in the distance
around 2:30 A.M.

1510
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:23,687
Shirley took her prescription
for Ativan,

1511
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:26,089
prescribed for her
by psychiatrist John Doucet,

1512
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:28,358
mixed it into your formula,
then took some herself.

1513
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:30,193
The only good thing
we know about this

1514
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,629
is that you were not conscious
and you did not suffer.

1515
01:10:32,696 --> 01:10:35,298
She then… she then walked
to the edge of a pier

1516
01:10:35,365 --> 01:10:37,567
and with you strapped
to her stomach with a sweater,

1517
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:39,202
she jumped
into the Atlantic ocean.

1518
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:43,407
Mommy loves you.

1519
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:46,109
Yes, I do.
Mommy loves you.

1520
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,745
Did you have a nice nap?
What did you dream about?

1521
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:52,516
Mommy loves you.
Mommy misses you.

1522
01:10:57,621 --> 01:11:01,224
He was found face upward
with his eyes wide open.

1523
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:04,027
And the policeman who found him

1524
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,030
said that he had wrapped him
in a blanket,

1525
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,665
rather than a plastic bag,

1526
01:11:08,732 --> 01:11:12,936
and he and another officer
carried him gently back.

1527
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:16,205
And he made very sure that
he kept the body very far away

1528
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,141
from the wicked woman
who had murdered him.

1529
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:21,445
When I sit here,
I hate her so much.

1530
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:26,215
When we came here,

1531
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,952
David and I realized
what Shirley Turner was.

1532
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:30,487
She was the devil.

1533
01:11:30,554 --> 01:11:34,457
But people think that you're
some kind of basic religious nut

1534
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:36,125
if you believe in the devil.

1535
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:38,261
I haven't prayed
since Zachary died. I haven't.

1536
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:40,263
I have some issues
I have to deal with.

1537
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:42,365
You know, my faith
has been tested by this.

1538
01:11:44,468 --> 01:11:46,636
Was a beautiful service.

1539
01:11:46,703 --> 01:11:49,205
A real tribute
to the little boy.

1540
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:51,608
Oh, I don't know how many people
were here, probably 300 or 400.

1541
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:53,209
Maybe more… I don't recall.

1542
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:57,346
I've never seen a coffin
so small before.

1543
01:11:59,716 --> 01:12:01,851
They shouldn't have them
that size.

1544
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:04,621
He was in his little suit

1545
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:08,492
that he'd had
the pictures taken in, I think.

1546
01:12:08,525 --> 01:12:09,793
What went in it?

1547
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:11,327
His little ball.

1548
01:12:11,394 --> 01:12:15,231
And I don't remember
if she put a truck in.

1549
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:19,969
Lots of kisses and hugs
and tears went in it.

1550
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:26,843
Lots of hopes and dreams.

1551
01:12:31,247 --> 01:12:33,282
Your grandma and grandpa
went back to England

1552
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:36,052
and spread your ashes
with your dad's.

1553
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:37,386
They went back to St. Louis

1554
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:40,123
and spread your ashes
with your dad's.

1555
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,959
And I didn't go with him.

1556
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:45,929
Andrew wanted to be cremated.
Oh, yes. Yes.

1557
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:47,263
What bothers Kate

1558
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:49,566
is that she did not go with him
to the crematorium

1559
01:12:49,633 --> 01:12:51,200
and stay with him
right to the end.

1560
01:12:51,267 --> 01:12:54,671
He went from the funeral home
to the crematorium all alone…

1561
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:58,875
In plastic bags…

1562
01:12:58,942 --> 01:13:02,245
With only his head sticking out!

1563
01:13:03,913 --> 01:13:06,282
Come on, Kate.

1564
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:10,954
He wouldn't care about that.

1565
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:19,428
That's why we went right up
to the oven doors with Zachary.

1566
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:30,707
This is what
that fucking bitch didn't know!

1567
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:32,408
Or maybe she did know.

1568
01:13:32,475 --> 01:13:34,844
This is what she's leaving.

1569
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:40,884
Maybe she did know.

1570
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:42,819
If she thought about it at all,

1571
01:13:42,886 --> 01:13:47,223
she didn't give a good goddamn!

1572
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:49,626
And this is what I hate her for.

1573
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:53,663
I hate her
for a lot of things…

1574
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,598
stealing
the rest of Andrew's life

1575
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:57,433
and virtually
all of Zachary's life

1576
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,435
and then this…

1577
01:13:59,502 --> 01:14:02,005
leaving us like this.

1578
01:14:03,607 --> 01:14:06,509
A couple of times,
lying in there in bed at night,

1579
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:11,080
I considered
fixing the problem myself.

1580
01:14:11,147 --> 01:14:13,382
Pick a night when Kate took
a sleeping pill,

1581
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,952
so she wouldn't know I was up.

1582
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:18,154
Get up in the middle
of the night.

1583
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:19,522
Dream up a pretext.

1584
01:14:19,623 --> 01:14:21,891
Go kill Shirley and come back
and go back to bed,

1585
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,627
so Kate would not know.

1586
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:27,831
That way, number one,
she could not harm Zachary.

1587
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:31,635
And number two, even if
they did catch me at it…

1588
01:14:31,668 --> 01:14:33,970
I'm the first one they come
looking for, of course…

1589
01:14:34,037 --> 01:14:35,404
but Kate could truthfully say

1590
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,106
she didn't know
that I was doing it,

1591
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:40,109
so she might still
get to bring up Zachary

1592
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:42,946
and get him started, even
if I go to prison in Canada.

1593
01:14:43,012 --> 01:14:46,650
We've worked through
possibilities ad nauseam.

1594
01:14:46,716 --> 01:14:48,251
Suppose we grab Zachary and run.

1595
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,987
Number one, we got to get
off the island of Newfoundland.

1596
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:54,057
The big drawback against living
here is getting out of here.

1597
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:55,725
There's only three ways
to do that…

1598
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:57,160
ferry, boat, airplane.

1599
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:59,929
The airplane and the ferry
would be covered

1600
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,330
as soon as Zachary's missing.

1601
01:15:01,397 --> 01:15:03,733
We'd have to hire a boat
somehow,

1602
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:07,170
which means you take in a third
party to the crime of kidnapping.

1603
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:09,272
We can't go home.

1604
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,775
We cannot ever identify
ourselves as ourselves.

1605
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,811
Have cash only stashed
all around the country.

1606
01:15:14,878 --> 01:15:17,013
Zachary would never be allowed
to know his family,

1607
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,514
our friends.

1608
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,549
So, that path…

1609
01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:23,720
big, big, big, big risk
with a horrible life.

1610
01:15:23,787 --> 01:15:25,188
So, that's out.

1611
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,757
Legal approaches we might
have taken. Invent something.

1612
01:15:27,824 --> 01:15:30,694
File affidavit saying
Shirley slipped one night

1613
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,328
when we were around

1614
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:34,230
and said a threat of some kind

1615
01:15:34,297 --> 01:15:36,099
that might get her incarcerated.

1616
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:38,768
But that would just be
our word against hers.

1617
01:15:38,835 --> 01:15:42,772
The best shot we had
at keeping Zachary alive

1618
01:15:42,839 --> 01:15:45,942
was I kill her myself.

1619
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:49,913
Other than doing that,
I can think of no other way

1620
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:52,481
to save Zachary from that bitch.

1621
01:15:57,721 --> 01:16:01,124
There's a logic in it.

1622
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:02,726
But I didn't do it,

1623
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:05,228
'cause I trusted government
to do its job.

1624
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:06,930
Government
is supposed to stop that

1625
01:16:06,996 --> 01:16:08,397
so I don't have to do it
personally.

1626
01:16:08,464 --> 01:16:10,399
In this case, they didn't even
get her off the street

1627
01:16:10,466 --> 01:16:12,101
and they even gave her a baby
to look after.

1628
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:15,004
My understanding is that
proper protocols were followed.

1629
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:18,074
I have asked my officials to…
did ask them some time ago…

1630
01:16:18,141 --> 01:16:21,110
to follow up with the board
to see, in fact,

1631
01:16:21,177 --> 01:16:24,613
that all the proper protocols
had been adhered to.

1632
01:16:24,748 --> 01:16:26,615
They were gambling
Zachary's life.

1633
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,351
They were gambling the lives

1634
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,986
of anyone
in the general population

1635
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:31,587
that Shirley
came in contact with.

1636
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:34,824
We, the vast majority
of good people

1637
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:36,559
who don't kill people,
are stuck.

1638
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:37,994
We got nowhere to go.

1639
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:39,863
We figured we'd hold
a press conference

1640
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:43,066
and try to push
for changes in law.

1641
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:45,368
The morning that we had
scheduled the press conference,

1642
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,770
I was in the shower.

1643
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:49,072
Kate came in with the phone.
"It's Jackie.

1644
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:51,140
She says we can't hold
the press conference."

1645
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:53,943
Technically, there's still
a press ban in place.

1646
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:56,412
I said, "fuck them.
Fuck them!

1647
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:58,848
"If they want to lock me up
for talking

1648
01:16:58,915 --> 01:17:00,984
while they let murderers
walk around free, just…"

1649
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,786
We believe that Shirley Turner

1650
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:05,822
bears 100% of the responsibility

1651
01:17:05,889 --> 01:17:07,791
for the murder of our son,
Andrew.

1652
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:09,658
We believe that the legal system

1653
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:12,428
helped her to kill
our grandson, Zachary.

1654
01:17:12,495 --> 01:17:15,832
When Shirley Turner was formally
charged and escaped to Canada,

1655
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:18,701
we naively thought she would be
sent back to Pennsylvania

1656
01:17:18,802 --> 01:17:20,503
within a few weeks at the most.

1657
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:22,538
When we learned
that she was out on bail,

1658
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:24,808
under an order
from justice David Russell,

1659
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:27,276
we were numb… numb!

1660
01:17:27,343 --> 01:17:29,212
Good afternoon.
Judge Russell's office.

1661
01:17:29,278 --> 01:17:31,147
I'm a documentary filmmaker,

1662
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:33,917
and I'm doing a documentary
about the Zachary Turner case.

1663
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:35,819
I think all he might
have done one time

1664
01:17:35,885 --> 01:17:37,620
was probably a bail review.

1665
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:40,489
Yeah, it was December 12, 2001,
actually. Yeah.

1666
01:17:40,556 --> 01:17:42,625
Judge Russell is sorry,
but he won't be able

1667
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,660
to be interviewed
in connection with that matter.

1668
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:46,462
Crown prosecutor Mike Madden

1669
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:48,531
didn't even argue against
her release on bail that day

1670
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,299
and instead entered
the courtroom

1671
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:52,235
with an agreement already
in place for her release.

1672
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:53,669
I'm a documentary filmmaker.

1673
01:17:53,736 --> 01:17:55,238
I was a friend of Andrew Bagby.

1674
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:57,140
Wondering
if you would be interested

1675
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:58,942
in possibly being
interviewed for…

1676
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,543
No, I don't think so.

1677
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:01,845
Not one penny
of her bail sureties

1678
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:03,847
had to be paid
by anyone who signed,

1679
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,049
nor did they have to show
proof of ability to pay.

1680
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:08,184
No money's put up.
No money at all. It's useless.

1681
01:18:08,251 --> 01:18:10,186
They could have put 20 cents
or $20 million.

1682
01:18:10,253 --> 01:18:11,554
Wouldn't have made
any difference.

1683
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,423
Her psychiatrist put up the
$65,000. That's another issue.

1684
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:16,525
Hi. You've reached
Dr. Doucet's office.

1685
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:18,361
Please leave your name,
telephone number,

1686
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:19,595
and a brief message.

1687
01:18:19,662 --> 01:18:21,664
Hi.
I'm calling for Dr. Doucet.

1688
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,032
My call was not returned.

1689
01:18:23,099 --> 01:18:24,767
Time. We thought
it was all about time.

1690
01:18:24,868 --> 01:18:27,403
Each step
in the extradition process,

1691
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:29,105
each incomprehensible delay…

1692
01:18:29,172 --> 01:18:31,740
four weeks, six weeks…
over and over again,

1693
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,442
there was another knife
in our guts.

1694
01:18:33,509 --> 01:18:36,445
"The law is slow,"
they told us, and it was!

1695
01:18:36,512 --> 01:18:39,382
Our lawyer Jackie
went to see Betty day,

1696
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:41,517
an administrator somewhere
in the hierarchy

1697
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:42,886
of child protective services,

1698
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:45,889
and told her
that we are concerned

1699
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:47,891
about the safety of the baby

1700
01:18:47,924 --> 01:18:51,560
because the mother is accused
of a pre-meditated murder.

1701
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:54,663
And nothing happened.

1702
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,632
Hello. Department of
health and community services.

1703
01:18:56,699 --> 01:18:58,801
Hi. I'm trying to reach
Elizabeth day.

1704
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:01,470
Elizabeth day is not available.

1705
01:19:01,537 --> 01:19:04,340
At the tone,
please record your message.

1706
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:05,574
My call was not returned.

1707
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:07,743
If you were in
the family health services,

1708
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:10,546
wouldn't you want to know
who this accused murderer

1709
01:19:10,613 --> 01:19:12,581
was arranging
for her baby to stay with?

1710
01:19:12,648 --> 01:19:14,083
Nobody ever came to see us.

1711
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,684
Before we left Sunnyvale,

1712
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,954
we got a police report
to say that we were good people.

1713
01:19:18,021 --> 01:19:20,389
Our friends and my employer,
et cetera, write letters

1714
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:23,659
that we were upright members
of the community.

1715
01:19:23,726 --> 01:19:25,161
Nobody asked us for that.

1716
01:19:25,228 --> 01:19:28,331
We could have been convicted
child molesters in California.

1717
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:30,533
They didn't care. And
nobody would've known.

1718
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,268
She wrote directly
to judge Derek green,

1719
01:19:32,335 --> 01:19:33,636
who responded
through his secretary

1720
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:35,338
with instructions
on how to write her own appeal

1721
01:19:35,404 --> 01:19:36,940
of his decision
to incarcerate her.

1722
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:39,943
Mr. KUENNE? Yeah,
this is chief justice green.

1723
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:43,679
What I did is on the record
and will speak for itself.

1724
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:44,947
Okay.
Okay.

1725
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:47,283
Under an order
from justice Gale welsh,

1726
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:50,853
Shirley Turner
was released on bail again,

1727
01:19:50,954 --> 01:19:52,956
and we went numb again.

1728
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:54,723
And we had to give Zachary

1729
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,093
right back into the hands
of Andrew's killer!

1730
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,228
"There is no indication
of a psychological disorder

1731
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,964
that would give concern about potential
harm to the public generally."

1732
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:04,700
Shirley's last boyfriend before
Andrew told Pennsylvania police

1733
01:20:04,767 --> 01:20:06,802
that Shirley attempted suicide
on his front doorstep

1734
01:20:06,869 --> 01:20:08,972
after he broke up with her
and had threatened to kill him.

1735
01:20:09,038 --> 01:20:11,074
"There is no indication
of a psychological disorder

1736
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,542
that would give concern about potential
harm to the public generally."

1737
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:15,311
Eight people had
restraining orders against her.

1738
01:20:15,378 --> 01:20:17,280
"There is no indication
of a psychological disorder

1739
01:20:17,346 --> 01:20:20,116
that would give concern about potential
harm to the public generally."

1740
01:20:20,183 --> 01:20:22,986
If anyone had bothered to check the
jail records during her two-month stay,

1741
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:24,988
the prison psychiatrist
put her on suicide watch,

1742
01:20:25,054 --> 01:20:26,455
she was incredibly disruptive,

1743
01:20:26,522 --> 01:20:28,624
and even threatened to stab
another inmate with a fork.

1744
01:20:28,691 --> 01:20:30,726
"There is no indication
of a psychological disorder

1745
01:20:30,793 --> 01:20:33,862
"that would give concern about potential
harm to the public generally,

1746
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:36,065
as her crime, while violent,
was specific in nature."

1747
01:20:36,132 --> 01:20:37,633
The man she was terrorizing

1748
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,468
called the police
and reported Shirley,

1749
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:41,971
but because he didn't leave his
name, no one took any action.

1750
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:44,540
"Her crime, while violent,
was specific in nature."

1751
01:20:44,607 --> 01:20:46,075
Andrew rejected her,
and she killed him.

1752
01:20:46,142 --> 01:20:48,911
Zachary rejected her.
He paid the price, too.

1753
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:51,780
"Her crime, while violent,
was specific in nature."

1754
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,349
Of course
the crime was specific.

1755
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:55,184
She didn't shoot
into a crowd of people.

1756
01:20:55,251 --> 01:20:57,386
We could not conceive
how they could let

1757
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:59,388
a probable
pre-meditated murderer…

1758
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:02,958
probable pre-meditated murderer
walk the streets.

1759
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:04,693
"Dr. Turner's detention

1760
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,929
is not necessary
in the public interest."

1761
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,197
Who the hell
is the system protecting?

1762
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:10,099
"Dr. Turner's detention
is not necessary

1763
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:11,300
in the public interest."

1764
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:13,536
We waited and we waited
and we waited

1765
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:18,274
for the authorities
to do their job and lock her up!

1766
01:21:18,341 --> 01:21:20,176
You got a dead body
with five holes in it,

1767
01:21:20,243 --> 01:21:21,577
and it means nothing!

1768
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:23,879
Under an order
from justice Gale welsh.

1769
01:21:23,946 --> 01:21:25,148
Good afternoon.
Court of appeal.

1770
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:26,682
May I speak
to judge welsh, please?

1771
01:21:26,749 --> 01:21:29,085
Is she expecting your call?
Probably not, no.

1772
01:21:29,152 --> 01:21:30,586
And now we've got
a second dead body

1773
01:21:30,653 --> 01:21:31,954
that couldn't breathe
through water.

1774
01:21:32,055 --> 01:21:33,689
I just spoke with judge welsh,
and she said no.

1775
01:21:33,756 --> 01:21:35,258
I just wanted to let you know.

1776
01:21:35,324 --> 01:21:37,393
"Dr. Turner's detention
is not necessary

1777
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,228
in the public interest."

1778
01:21:39,295 --> 01:21:40,663
Son of a…
Son of a…

1779
01:21:54,977 --> 01:21:57,113
She had to be stopped.

1780
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,748
The people who were
supposed to stop her didn't.

1781
01:21:59,815 --> 01:22:02,651
And she got to kill again.

1782
01:22:02,718 --> 01:22:05,254
And I'm gonna do my damnedest
to see if I can

1783
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:07,923
make them change the way
they deal with killers.

1784
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:11,327
And with that, your grandma
and grandpa became activists.

1785
01:22:11,394 --> 01:22:12,795
We victims…

1786
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:15,998
We want, number one,
the whole truth public

1787
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:17,800
about why Zachary died.

1788
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:20,136
They've developed
a program, a support group,

1789
01:22:20,203 --> 01:22:22,938
for people
who have had a death through,

1790
01:22:23,005 --> 01:22:24,407
you know, violent death.

1791
01:22:24,473 --> 01:22:26,109
Welcome to our first…

1792
01:22:26,142 --> 01:22:28,477
Victims of homicide
annual vigil.

1793
01:22:28,544 --> 01:22:30,546
In this last year,
I've just taken training

1794
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:35,251
to become a child advocate
in the dependency court system.

1795
01:22:35,318 --> 01:22:36,919
John Doucet, the psychiatrist

1796
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:40,156
who posted $65,000 bail
for Ms. Turner,

1797
01:22:40,223 --> 01:22:42,825
was found guilty
of professional misconduct.

1798
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:44,327
It was David Bagby and his wife

1799
01:22:44,393 --> 01:22:46,562
who launched the complaint
against Doucet.

1800
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:48,431
The three-person panel
ordered Doucet

1801
01:22:48,497 --> 01:22:50,433
to undergo
psychiatric counseling.

1802
01:22:50,499 --> 01:22:52,568
There was a lot of
sympathy for David and Kate.

1803
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,637
I think it got them
at least a result

1804
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:56,572
that they were hoping
to accomplish.

1805
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:59,375
Mr. Wicks, child and youth
advocate for Newfoundland.

1806
01:22:59,442 --> 01:23:01,377
Is doing a child death review,

1807
01:23:01,444 --> 01:23:03,179
which is a formal investigation

1808
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:05,814
and the output of it
is a report saying,

1809
01:23:05,881 --> 01:23:07,450
"here's why
that baby died."

1810
01:23:07,516 --> 01:23:09,185
And recommendations for changes

1811
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:12,154
to cut the chance
of that happening in the future.

1812
01:23:12,155 --> 01:23:14,290
Obviously, once that's done,

1813
01:23:14,357 --> 01:23:16,192
then we would like
to see that go

1814
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:18,394
to whatever legislative bodies,

1815
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:20,563
either provincial or federal,

1816
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:24,032
can write laws to make
these recommendations real.

1817
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:29,605
And a report into
the death of Zachary Turner

1818
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,174
will be released
in Newfoundland.

1819
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,509
Your grandma was
temporarily injured in a fall

1820
01:23:33,576 --> 01:23:35,711
and couldn't make the trip,

1821
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:37,546
so your grandpa and I
came alone.

1822
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:40,683
Dr. Markesteyn conducted
an exhaustive investigation

1823
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:42,518
over a 15-month period.

1824
01:23:42,585 --> 01:23:44,987
He reached two key conclusions.

1825
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:47,690
One, Zachary Turner's death
was preventable.

1826
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:49,692
And, two,
Zachary was in his mother's care

1827
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:51,194
when he should not have been.

1828
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,729
The government has received
a scathing report

1829
01:23:53,796 --> 01:23:55,898
that concluded
the child-protection system

1830
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:57,533
failed Zachary Turner.

1831
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,803
A serious lack of judgment
at the senior-management level.

1832
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,105
Substandard
child-protection practices

1833
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:04,473
contributed to the outcomes.

1834
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,575
There are 58
recommendations in the report.

1835
01:24:06,642 --> 01:24:08,411
I am announcing our action plan.

1836
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:10,579
We will develop policy
specific to children

1837
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:13,882
whose parents are charged
with a violent crime.

1838
01:24:13,949 --> 01:24:16,952
The part I was most interested
in, as I said, is bail.

1839
01:24:17,019 --> 01:24:18,987
Why was
Dr. Shirley Turner granted

1840
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:22,425
judicial interim release,
commonly known as bail?

1841
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:23,959
This is the one question

1842
01:24:24,026 --> 01:24:26,662
that Dr. Markesteyn did not
and could not answer.

1843
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:29,031
So, that's still
an open wound, if you would.

1844
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:30,966
He did say this…
"had Dr. Turner

1845
01:24:31,033 --> 01:24:34,470
"not been released on bail
on 12 December 2001

1846
01:24:34,537 --> 01:24:37,440
"or on 10 January 2003,

1847
01:24:37,506 --> 01:24:40,142
"my review would have been
unnecessary.

1848
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:42,244
Zachary would be alive today."

1849
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:44,247
I would like to see
parliament pass a law

1850
01:24:44,313 --> 01:24:46,982
denying bail to people
accused of murder.

1851
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:48,817
Put them on the fast track
to get to trial

1852
01:24:48,884 --> 01:24:50,686
and get on with it,
get to the truth.

1853
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:52,455
The only way
I can see it changing

1854
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:55,291
is for every citizen who cares
about this to tell his M.P.

1855
01:24:55,358 --> 01:24:57,360
That "this law is stupid.
Change it."

1856
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:59,362
And, of course,
such a selfish thing to do.

1857
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:00,963
She not only killed Andrew,

1858
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:03,666
but she left three other
children without a mother,

1859
01:25:03,732 --> 01:25:05,568
which is very sad for them.

1860
01:25:05,634 --> 01:25:07,703
And what kind of regret
does that give you?

1861
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:10,439
Well, if things were different,

1862
01:25:10,506 --> 01:25:12,441
I guess it's possible
he'd still be alive

1863
01:25:12,508 --> 01:25:15,811
and rather than memories
of just one year,

1864
01:25:15,878 --> 01:25:18,414
there'd be a lot of years
there now.

1865
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:21,317
Tough losing a little brother.
Yeah, definitely.

1866
01:25:21,384 --> 01:25:23,151
Zachary should be
right here with me.

1867
01:25:23,286 --> 01:25:25,288
He should be off
going to school now.

1868
01:25:25,354 --> 01:25:28,023
I am going to continue
to scream long and loud

1869
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:31,694
about bail for someone accused

1870
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,430
of what Shirley did to my son.

1871
01:25:46,008 --> 01:25:47,576
I'd traveled the world for years

1872
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,478
looking for what was left
of your dad.

1873
01:25:49,545 --> 01:25:50,946
I'd made dozens of new friends.

1874
01:25:51,013 --> 01:25:53,316
Dr. DICUCCIO has made the trek
out to California.

1875
01:25:53,382 --> 01:25:55,418
But there was still one question
I couldn't answer.

1876
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:57,753
How would I know
when I was done?

1877
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,688
And what was I
really looking for?

1878
01:25:59,755 --> 01:26:02,658
Both as
spirituality and as grief,

1879
01:26:02,725 --> 01:26:05,594
the relocation of
the other person is essential.

1880
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:08,931
My first response
was, "that's not a person."

1881
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:15,237
That is simply a mass of tissue
and protein and fat and water.

1882
01:26:15,338 --> 01:26:17,873
Something leaves a body
when death occurs.

1883
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:19,074
What was I trying to find?

1884
01:26:19,141 --> 01:26:21,109
To resolve our grief,

1885
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:24,347
we have to be able to accept
the reality of that loss…

1886
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:26,148
Who's interviewing you, Kurt?

1887
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:28,884
…Get our questions
answered to the extent that they can be

1888
01:26:28,951 --> 01:26:30,386
and to basically surrender

1889
01:26:30,453 --> 01:26:33,121
to the things
that we can't have answered.

1890
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:35,057
And how would I know
when I'd found it?

1891
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:36,825
I appreciate you doing this
for him,

1892
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:38,661
'cause I know he talked
about you a lot.

1893
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:41,263
- He'd talk about you.
- Really?

1894
01:26:42,898 --> 01:26:45,133
Well, then, you're not
a good moviemaker, huh?

1895
01:26:48,471 --> 01:26:50,205
'Cause that's what
he always told me.

1896
01:26:50,272 --> 01:26:51,974
I know he loved you.

1897
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,009
And then to
be able to continue to live

1898
01:26:54,076 --> 01:26:55,678
remembering the person.

1899
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:59,114
To be able to remember their
life, not only their death.

1900
01:26:59,181 --> 01:27:00,683
No, no, no.
I can feel it.

1901
01:27:00,749 --> 01:27:03,452
It's not far off.
It's too late.

1902
01:27:03,519 --> 01:27:05,388
I didn't want to stop
making this movie.

1903
01:27:05,454 --> 01:27:07,923
That would mean I'd learned
everything there was to know

1904
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:10,025
and finished
my one last movie with him.

1905
01:27:10,092 --> 01:27:14,530
Earl Grollman says grief is
love's unwillingness to let go.

1906
01:27:14,597 --> 01:27:16,298
He doesn't like to wave goodbye.

1907
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:17,933
I'll miss you.

1908
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:22,471
Well, I'll be going.
Bye.

1909
01:27:26,141 --> 01:27:27,910
One more time.
And action!

1910
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:31,213
It is my brother
that got married here tonight.

1911
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:32,848
One more time.
And action!

1912
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:35,417
This is your uncle Kurt.

1913
01:27:35,418 --> 01:27:37,586
One more time.
And action!

1914
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:43,191
When the person says,

1915
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,194
"life will never be
the same again, will it?"

1916
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,831
They now know where they are

1917
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:51,166
and what's involved
in moving forward.

1918
01:27:51,233 --> 01:27:54,236
There were so many
stories I wanted to tell you.

1919
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:57,272
And somewhere
I hope you're watching.

1920
01:27:57,339 --> 01:28:00,509
I almost gave up making
this film when you were killed.

1921
01:28:00,576 --> 01:28:02,277
I couldn't see the point
anymore.

1922
01:28:02,344 --> 01:28:04,980
But something kept me going.

1923
01:28:05,047 --> 01:28:07,650
And then one day I realized
what it was.

1924
01:28:09,452 --> 01:28:12,120
This film was no longer
a letter to you.

1925
01:28:12,187 --> 01:28:14,122
It was now a letter
to someone else.

1926
01:28:14,189 --> 01:28:16,559
We thought we'd go get Andrew,

1927
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:18,126
get everything organized,
whatever,

1928
01:28:18,193 --> 01:28:20,362
and then kill ourselves,
'cause no point in going on.

1929
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:21,864
Everybody always says,

1930
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:23,932
"what would be the difference
if one person weren't alive?"

1931
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:26,502
You've still got
a hell of a lot to live for,

1932
01:28:26,569 --> 01:28:30,472
and you've still got a lot
of friends and a lot of family

1933
01:28:30,473 --> 01:28:32,741
who love you very, very much.

1934
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:34,843
You are the most amazing and…

1935
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:36,311
I love both of you.

1936
01:28:36,378 --> 01:28:38,781
…The strongest
people I've ever known.

1937
01:28:38,847 --> 01:28:40,482
I love you guys.
I love them very much.

1938
01:28:40,483 --> 01:28:42,485
I love them very much.
I love them very much.

1939
01:28:42,518 --> 01:28:44,687
Now, how am I gonna do this
without weeping?

1940
01:28:44,753 --> 01:28:47,490
I admire you and respect you
so much for two things.

1941
01:28:47,556 --> 01:28:49,792
One, for such a wonderful
young man that you raised.

1942
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:52,194
It doesn't matter what
happened. They raised a wonderful man.

1943
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,229
Thanks for bringing such a
wonderful person into the world.

1944
01:28:54,296 --> 01:28:56,732
You know,
Andrew contributed a lot to me

1945
01:28:56,799 --> 01:28:58,667
as far as who I am today.

1946
01:28:58,734 --> 01:28:59,968
We won't forget their son.

1947
01:29:00,035 --> 01:29:01,537
And for having the strength

1948
01:29:01,604 --> 01:29:04,106
to make it through
something like this.

1949
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,575
With what you've been
through, to still be carrying on,

1950
01:29:06,642 --> 01:29:10,679
still to hold your heads up and
keep going and pushing forward

1951
01:29:10,746 --> 01:29:12,514
is amazing.

1952
01:29:12,515 --> 01:29:14,683
They've done it in such
a way that it makes you proud

1953
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,418
to know them
and to be related to them.

1954
01:29:16,519 --> 01:29:18,220
I think god put some people
down on earth

1955
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:20,623
just to be examples
for the rest of us.

1956
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:23,626
You are two
very, very special people.

1957
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:25,160
There's a few things in my life

1958
01:29:25,227 --> 01:29:27,529
that have had an effect on me
like those two people.

1959
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:29,264
I don't know how else.
I love them.

1960
01:29:29,331 --> 01:29:30,999
We love you.
Well, we love them.

1961
01:29:31,066 --> 01:29:33,536
We're always thinking of you.
I think about them daily.

1962
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:35,403
My thoughts are never far
from either of you.

1963
01:29:35,538 --> 01:29:36,972
I love them and pray for them.

1964
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:38,373
God's blessings on them both.

1965
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,808
Oh, they know I love them.

1966
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:43,078
I feel very blessed, as I say,
to be among their friends.

1967
01:29:43,145 --> 01:29:46,014
I just thank them for being
my friends for 30-odd years.

1968
01:29:46,081 --> 01:29:48,283
We're very lucky to have them
as our neighbors

1969
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:49,852
and our true friends.

1970
01:29:49,918 --> 01:29:51,286
God bless you guys and call me.

1971
01:29:51,353 --> 01:29:55,457
And as one of Andrew's
very good friends told us

1972
01:29:55,558 --> 01:29:58,727
very soon after he was murdered,
we still have children.

1973
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:03,566
Kurt, Matt, Chris,
on down the list.

1974
01:30:03,632 --> 01:30:05,267
I feel like I got lucky in life

1975
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:07,069
'cause they're another set
of parents.

1976
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:09,104
Kate and David were a big reason

1977
01:30:09,171 --> 01:30:11,874
why I am the person
that I am today.

1978
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:13,208
We're all their kids.

1979
01:30:13,275 --> 01:30:14,677
I'll always be there
for you guys.

1980
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:15,944
And I love you both dearly.

1981
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:17,345
We all love you guys so much.

1982
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:19,648
There's really nothing
that I wouldn't do for them.

1983
01:30:19,715 --> 01:30:24,386
Do you feel better?
Do you feel better?

1984
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:26,855
Yeah.

1985
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:28,924
Yeah, you make me feel better.

1986
01:30:28,991 --> 01:30:30,525
I know that no matter what,

1987
01:30:30,593 --> 01:30:34,963
you're going to find ways
to continue to help people,

1988
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:37,700
because that's the type
of people you are.

1989
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:39,034
That's how good you are.

1990
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:41,003
I just hope
that Dave and Kate realize

1991
01:30:41,069 --> 01:30:42,370
how much he loved them,

1992
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,640
because just in the short
period of time that I knew him,

1993
01:30:44,707 --> 01:30:47,309
that was the one truth
that I knew to be absolute.

1994
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:49,511
I'm glad I wasn't
a rebellious youth,

1995
01:30:49,578 --> 01:30:51,714
because it would have been
completely and utterly

1996
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,582
fucking wasted
on David and Kate Bagby.

1997
01:30:53,649 --> 01:30:54,783
I mean, totally.

1998
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:58,120
I had my ear pierced
for two weeks.

1999
01:30:58,186 --> 01:30:59,788
They never noticed.

2000
01:30:59,855 --> 01:31:01,523
I'm finally sitting
at the dinner table,

2001
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:03,191
and I actually said to them,
I'm like,

2002
01:31:03,258 --> 01:31:04,793
"you know, mom, dad,

2003
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:06,862
"it's a good thing
I'm not looking for attention,

2004
01:31:06,929 --> 01:31:08,463
because hello!"

2005
01:31:08,530 --> 01:31:10,365
And they just had a look at it,
and they're like,

2006
01:31:10,432 --> 01:31:12,367
"oh, that's nice.
When did you get that done?"

2007
01:31:12,434 --> 01:31:14,069
And I love you,

2008
01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:17,139
and I know you love me and…

2009
01:31:17,205 --> 01:31:20,308
Yeah. I kind of need to
move on from that.

2010
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:23,411
'Cause I'm a Bagby male.
We don't gush very much.

2011
01:31:30,452 --> 01:31:33,455
