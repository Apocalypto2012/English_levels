180
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,792
You holding up okay?

181
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:27,712
No one even
comes back here.

182
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:30,923
Come on.
It's been three years.

183
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,176
Let me hear that
annoying-ass voice of yours.

184
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:37,930
Please?

185
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,974
It's me.

186
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,649
See? They can't take
everything away.

187
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:51,569
See? You're still
the same annoying pest

188
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:53,154
who's great at
slicing tree fruit

189
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:56,991
and even better at making Tobin
feel like a piece of shit.

190
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,826
Hey. Hey.

191
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,578
Hey, when my manager
isn't looking,

192
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,705
I fart on his lunch.
Yeah.

193
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:05,166
Yeah, but I'm not talking,
like, a one-cheek squeak.

194
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,836
I'm talking like a full,
bullhorn fucking blast.

195
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:11,255
[laughing]
There you are. There you are.

196
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:12,840
[Kerwin] Jesus, these morons.

197
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:16,344
I gotta do everything
myself.

198
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:18,137
The hell are you two
doing back here?

199
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:23,643
You're not allowed here.

200
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,395
Oh, your keeper's
not gonna be happy.

201
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:27,230
- Don't touch her!

202
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:32,318
- Know your place!

203
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,153
How dare you speak...

204
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:46,624
[screaming]

205
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,584
Oh, we are not done.

206
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:53,756
- All of this is lies.
Lies!

207
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:54,966
- It's okay, everyone.

208
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,051
Reaper should be here
any moment.

209
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:58,219
I hope.

210
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:00,930
- You promised me!
I gave you four years.

211
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:03,099
Where's my beach?
My freedom?

212
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:06,269
That contract is bullshit!
All of this is bullshit!

213
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,019
[gunshot]

214
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,604

215
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,192
[laughter]

216
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:17,780
[applause]

217
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,910
- Well, that was stressful.
[laughs]

218
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:26,080
Anywho, lockdown's lifted.
You're all free to go.

219
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:28,082
And, please,
grab a Black Hole burger

220
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:28,916
for the road.

221
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,334
[chuckles]

222
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:34,297
Just you wait.

223
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:41,637
[wincing]

224
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:44,098
- Just give me
the napkin.

225
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,601
- No, I don't
want your help.

226
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,311
- You need it.
- Do I?

227
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:55,401
I'll show you.

228
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:00,740
[humming]

229
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,952
[groaning]

230
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:10,792
- You've done this before,
haven't you?

231
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,587
[grunts, chuckles]

232
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:17,507
[thunder crashes]

233
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,342
What is a Watkyn's storm,
anyway?

234
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:22,178
- A nuclear plant in
Watkyn's Harbor exploded

235
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,763
when the power went out,

236
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:25,765
poisoned the atmosphere.

237
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,683
The further east you go,
the worse it gets,

238
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:31,312
so we just got to
wait it out a while.

239
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:33,189
- How long is a while?

240
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:36,401
Oh, my God.

241
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,361
[thunder crashes]

242
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,953
[thunder crashes]

243
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:13,688
- Oh, lucky shot.
- Really?

244
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:14,647
You wanna make it
interesting?

245
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,691
- Okay.

246
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:19,652
I sink it, I get to ask
you whatever I want.

247
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:21,904
You sink it,
same deal.

248
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:25,408
- Fine.
You go first.

249
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,452
You fucker.
[chuckles]

250
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,287
You played me.
- Me? No!

251
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,874
That was just luck.
But since you lost,

252
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,001
what's the coolest place
you've ever been?

253
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:36,878
- Are you seriously not
gonna ask me my first name?

254
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,590
- Oh, shit. Wait, no.
- Nope!

255
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,676
Disneyland.
- What's that?

256
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:45,553
- You never heard of
Disneyland?

257
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:46,721
I went there
when I was a kid.

258
00:14:46,763 --> 00:14:48,264
Before the fall.
Lots of kids did.

259
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:51,517
It had a castle, rides,
princesses, Mickey Mouse.

260
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,643
- Why did this mouse
have a name?

261
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:54,562
Why was he so special?
- Excuse me.

262
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:56,689
Mickey was very cool.

263
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:57,732
He had a snappy little tux,

264
00:14:57,774 --> 00:14:59,192
and he gave very
good hugs, too.

265
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,153
- You hugged a giant mouse?
That's disgusting.

266
00:15:02,195 --> 00:15:04,572
I would never take a child
to this land of monsters.

267
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:07,950
- It was the happiest place
on earth, motherfucker.

268
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:09,327
Let me guess, the coolest
place you've ever been

269
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,161
is up your own ass.

270
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:11,954
- Ah, ah, ah, play the game.

271
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:19,879
The Container Store.

272
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:22,090
- The Container Store?
- Yes.

273
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:26,594
Picture a store full of
plastic containers, dispensers,

274
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:29,013
big, small,
all different colors.

275
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:31,432
When I get my own spot
in New San Francisco,

276
00:15:31,474 --> 00:15:34,977
everything is gonna have
its own place to go.

277
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,604
- Do you own anything
of value?

278
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:38,523
- Ah... You already asked
your question.

279
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:41,275
Now it's my turn.

280
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:42,735
[laughs]

281
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:44,195
- What do you mean you've never
stepped in the ocean?

282
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:46,030
- Never have and never will.

283
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:48,825
- What? Why?
- Ghosts.

284
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,326
The ghosts in the ocean?

285
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:52,703
- There aren't any fucking
ghosts in the ocean!

286
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:53,913
- Have you ever been
to the ocean?

287
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:56,165
It's dark, man.
Look, the shadows

288
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:59,043
are the perfect
breeding ground for spirits.

289
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:00,420
And, have you ever heard of
ghost ships?

290
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:03,214
Who the fuck do you think
are piloting those ships?

291
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:07,385
Dolphins?
- You fucking dunce.

292
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:10,304
- You don't have to laugh, man.
- Yes, I do.

293
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:12,098
That is the dumbest shit
I've ever heard.

294
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,725
Next, you're gonna tell me
you believe in

295
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:16,978
life on other planets.

296
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,272
Oh, fuck off!
- Not aliens like this.

297
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:20,815
But come on,
you mean to tell me

298
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:23,109
that you think we're the only
ones in the whole universe?

299
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:26,070
Just us? It's a sad way of
thinking, if you ask me.

300
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:27,405
- You'd rather
believe in aliens?

301
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:29,824
- I rather believe
we're not in it alone.

302
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:30,867
- Oh, well, we're not alone,

303
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:33,327
because, you know,
ocean ghosts.

304
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:34,829
- Have you ever been to
the bottom of the ocean,

305
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:36,122
or space?
- Not lately.

306
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:40,168
- So you don't know
what's out there, do you?

307
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:42,295
- I'll give you that.
- Thank you.

308
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:45,423
- I never saw a Watkyn's storm
before today, obviously.

309
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:47,341
- But I've never seen
a llama and a goat

310
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,177
in the same room
at the same time.

311
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:50,762
And if we're being honest...

00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:54,932
[both] I think they're
the same animal.

313
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,934
- I've never broken my arm.

314
00:16:56,976 --> 00:16:59,187
- I've never
ridden a bicycle.

315
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:00,938
- I've never seen snow.

316
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,400
- I've never seen
a baby pigeon.

317
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:08,071
- I've never fucked
in a ball pit... twice.

00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:14,035

You know what it was?

It was that motherfucker's
teeth, you know?

on somebody else's face,

a bigger face.

Anyway, Adrian was
the last person

that I had sex with,
and it just wasn't very good.

got in the way?

- Think about it.
- Oh!
