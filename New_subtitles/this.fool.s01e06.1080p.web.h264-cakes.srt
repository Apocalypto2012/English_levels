1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:02,854
You think you're gonna have kids?

2
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:05,231
No, because I have no idea
what I would name them.

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,524
I've met too many people.

4
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,735
I have a negative association
with every single name.

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,196
- What about...
- Donovan?

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,906
Ooh. Forgot about Donovan.

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,449
Donovan's a good name.

8
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,868
Bet my life would have been a lot better
if my name was Donovan.

9
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,328
Yeah, I like Donovan.

10
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,437
Huh. Maybe I'll reverse the vasectomy.

11
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,416
Do you keep doing that back and forth

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,794
over and over again or does a hole
become permanent at some point again?

13
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,070
You can do anything you want.

14
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,038
Hey, Rocio.

15
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,540
I need you to take this crap
to Memo's place.

16
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,083
Damn, nice to see you too.

17
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,234
¿Cómo estás?

18
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,170
And try to do it by tonight.

19
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,005
I don't wanna talk
to that piece of shit right now.

20
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,465
Damn, I don't wanna see
that fool either.

21
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,675
- Shut up, Julio.
- You're not the one divorcing him.

22
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,385
Just do me this favor
so you can pat yourself on the back

23
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,386
and feel good about it later.

24
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,453
Cool, thanks.

25
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,709
- Fuckin' key his truck.
- I gotta go to work.

26
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,155
I don't want that shit in my house.

27
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,390
- Shut up.
- Hi, Luis. Bye, Luis.

28
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,745
Check it out.

29
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,622
We don't have to wipe our ass
with sandpaper anymore.

30
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,082
I got the one
with the cute-ass little bears on it.

31
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,706
Dawg, put that shit away. Put it away!

32
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,810
Dawg, it's like prison here.

33
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,831
And her toilet paper is shredding my culo.

34
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,249
Don't worry about it, playboy.

35
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,693
Soon your asshole
will become leather just like mine.

36
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,072
Dawg, I'm bleeding!

37
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,089
Shh.

38
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,500
Man, what the fuck?

39
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,427
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

40
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,405
Fuck off, man.

41
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,573
I'm just trying to do my job.

42
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,700
- That's our recycling.
- My mom turns that shit in for money.

43
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,035
What you need the fucking money for?

44
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,871
We're poor. We need those cans.

45
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,789
You're not poor. You're broke.

46
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,124
There's a difference.

47
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,458
I'm fuckin' poor.

48
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,627
- What are you even talking about?
- Put that bag down.

49
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,361
Can I ask your young ass a question?

50
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,215
You ever been late on your utility bills?

51
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,425
Yeah, all the time.

52
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,677
Well, I've never been late
on my utility bills. You know why?

53
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,930
Because I don't have
a motherfuckin' house to live in

54
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,265
'cause I'm poor.

55
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,875
I wish I was broke enough
to even have a bill.

56
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,710
Must be nice.

57
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,670
But whatever, man.

58
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,380
You keep 'em.

59
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,883
Broke asshole.

60
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,721
Yo. Come back.

61
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:31,951
Just take them.

62
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,203
Yeah?

63
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,954
Yeah, you need them more.

64
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:35,979
Oh.

65
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,042
Damn, man.

66
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,067
Thank you.

67
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:41,777
You a good guy.

68
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:44,530
You a good guy.

69
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,198
You a good guy.

70
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,699
You a good guy.

71
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,175
Ah, dale, mamacita, yeah.

72
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,719
Hey!

73
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,484
Sí, sí, tía,
gracias for all the staplers.

74
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:24,862
No, no, no, no.

75
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,225
Hola, mamacita.

76
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,663
Sorry to bother you,
but my recycling was stolen last night.

77
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,087
I'm checking with all the neighbors
to see if theirs did too.

78
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,317
- Please hold.
- Julio!

79
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:06,987
Okay.

80
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,459
Hmm.

81
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,525
Motherfucker! They got us too.

82
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,819
Motherfucker! Imma kill
whoever stole my recycling.

83
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,404
You don't fuck with my money.

84
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,489
Yeah, kill the motherfucker!

85
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,657
Damn, Darius. Don't you think
that's a little too far?

86
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,159
Don't fuck with my money then.

87
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,144
Listen, you see something,
you let me know.

88
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,313
Adios, mamacita.

89
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,990
Hey, broke guy.

90
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,116
What the fuck do you want?

91
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,409
You got any more cans?

92
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,119
My neighbor Darius says
if he catches you,

93
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,579
he's gonna smoke your ass.

94
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,456
- Man, fuck Darius.
- I ain't thinking about no damn Darius.

95
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,208
That old stingy motherfucker.

96
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,209
Hey.

97
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,295
W... Well, I-I...
I may need a lookout, though,

98
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,464
so, uh, are you down for helping me out?

99
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,175
No, I ain't trying
to get merked out here.

100
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,384
Oh, come on, Julio.

101
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,554
I was thinking we could be like
Batman and Robin Hood.

102
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,618
You know, steal from the broke
and give to the poor.

103
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,057
Me.

104
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,267
Look, I'm really sorry.

105
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,686
I can't help you steal from my neighbors.

106
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,837
Okay. I thought you had my back.

107
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,758
Seeing as how you such a... good guy.

108
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,195
Such a good guy.

109
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,654
Such a good guy.

110
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:37,930
Such a good guy.

111
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,224
I'll get my shoes.

112
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,297
Oh!

113
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,655
Uh, you think you could give me a ride
to the recycling center?

114
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,785
Okay, but this is the last time
I'm doing you a solid.

115
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,580
Oh, thank you, Señor Julio.

116
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:11,207
Before you, I never knew a friendship

117
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,085
between a poor individual such as myself

118
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,486
and a broke motherfucker like you
could even be possible.

119
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,173
See, that's the thing about me.

120
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,674
I feel like I've always
just had the ability

121
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,967
to be friends with anyone.

122
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,343
I don't know,
I guess I'm a good guy like that.

123
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,469
Hey, you are. You are.

124
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,079
Hey, real quick, uh,
can I take a shit in your house?

125
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,332
Wait. What the fuck?

126
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,293
Where the fuck is my car?

127
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,436
Ay!

128
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,500
Que es eso?

129
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:54,709
What the hell is going on out there?

130
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,669
Luis. What the fuck?

131
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,861
You motherfuckers.

132
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,299
Yo, Darius. Uh, it was all Julio.

133
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,468
Here's your can thief. Shoot him.

134
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,852
You gonna pay me for these cans.

135
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,371
Hey, chingados.

136
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,617
Looks bomb.

137
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,084
Ay, Mamá.

138
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:27,993
Uh...

139
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,159
Esperanza!

140
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:27,928
¡Mamá!

141
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:53,662
That's disgusting.

142
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,406
What's up, Julio? Great to see you.

143
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,514
Here's your shit.

144
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:14,909
Thanks, man.

145
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,704
Hey, you wanna hang out
and throw back some chelas?

146
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,122
No, I don't wanna hang out with you.

147
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,165
You fucked over my sister,

148
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,107
and now you have me
running errands for you?

149
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,419
You probably hate me, huh?

150
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,320
Yeah, I guess I do.

151
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,572
But not as much as your sister.

152
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,176
Jesus Christ, Memo.

153
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,636
Stop fuckin' crying and be a man.

154
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,388
I fucked up everything with your sister,

155
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,706
and now
I'm fucking up everything with you.

156
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,560
Please, Memo, don't make this awkward.

157
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:41,978
But I'm so lonely.

158
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,105
You're all I got left.

159
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,065
You're all I got left.

160
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,609
You're all I got left.

161
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,426
You're all I got left.

162
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:36,515
Ay!

163
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,272
Oh.

164
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,047
Hey, fool.

165
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,281
Remember when you got
fucked up at Ana's quince?

166
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,429
What kinda pomade you use?

167
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,080
Layrite or Suavecito?

168
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:26,458
Hey, fool,
a magician never reveals his secrets.

169
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,465
Hey, man, thank you
for hanging out with me, Julio.

170
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,801
Yeah, no problem.

171
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:39,346
Even though you're not my bro anymore,
you still my bro.

172
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,812
You wanna hit the pookie with me?

173
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,774
Dawg! That's why my sister
left your ass!

174
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,003
I know.

175
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,029
It's the only way
I could deal with this shit.

176
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,574
Skante saved my life, dawg.

177
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,469
Stop crying!

178
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,328
I'm sorry. I'm such an idiot.

179
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,516
I just didn't wanna smoke alone.

180
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,044
I thought you'd be down
