00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,480
Why is no one controlling the area?

3
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,320
Why are you so late?

4
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,110
Come this way.

5
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,870
Hey! Hurry upstairs!

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,540
Hey! Damn it!

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,040
Seonga!

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,040
Seonga...

SHADOW DETECTIVE SEASON 2

11
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,030
-You're here.
Yeah.

12
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,040
It seems like a gas leak caused the fire,

13
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,250
but we need to investigate further
for exact details.

14
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,780
Hey, don't let cars come in here.
Hey, Officer Kang. Come here, you punk.

15
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,320
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

16
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,200
What did Son Gyeongchan say
when he got here?

17
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,660
About what, sir?

18
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,030
I said, what did Son Gyeongchan say
when he got here, moron?

19
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,330
What was Lee Seonga doing here?

20
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,830
He says he doesn't know either.

21
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,700
But he's her partner!

22
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,210
Lee Seonga's call records.
Look them up and send them to me, got it?

23
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,000
- Yes, sir.
- Get going.

24
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,420
- Run, you punk!
- Yes, sir!

25
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,460
Don't cross the line!

26
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,380
Move your car!

Yeah.

39
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,620
They said she had a brain contusion

40
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,530
from the shock of the explosion.

41
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,450
They don't know when she'll wake up.

42
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,660
We'll have to wait and see.

43
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,920
She'll wake up soon enough.

44
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,880
She's strong.

45
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,180
Take good care of her.

46
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
Why...

47
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,390
Why did you tell me to stop her?

48
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,070
You told me to stop Seonga
from digging into Woo Jangik's case.

49
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,900
Why was that?

50
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
See you.

51
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,800
Chief Baek,

52
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,470
the problem of runaway teens
and serial thefts in the area is serious.

53
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,770
Do you have a solution?

54
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,730
Yes, we created a task force
for runaway teenagers and--

55
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,520
An individual who had been in conflict
with a runaway teenager died

56
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,860
from a gas explosion.
Where are you with the investigation?

57
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,030
I heard a police officer
was seriously injured.

58
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,740
- How is the officer doing?
- Yes, it's quite an unfortunate incident.

59
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,370
We are thoroughly investigating the fire,

60
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,700
and the injured police officer
is recovering quickly.

61
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,450
I'd like to ask Director Choi Dohyung.

62
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,370
Do you have anything to say
about the problems with delinquent teens

63
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,250
that have persisted recently
near the Geumo redevelopment area?

64
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,210
The foundation...

65
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,420
will be announcing a plan
to build a shelter for runaway teenagers

66
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,300
and a vocational education center.

67
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,220
However...

68
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,850
I don't think it's right to label children
with words like "delinquent."

69
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,270
So, please.

70
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,650
Ladies and gentlemen.

71
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,110
Ask the children
what they want to do in the future,

72
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,150
not what they did in the past.

73
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,240
Please!

74
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,620
Director Choi.
Director Choi!

75
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,410
Are there any other measures being taken?

76
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,370
We are doing our best to prepare them.

77
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,730
Hey. You're Hana, right?

78
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,640
Excuse me?

79
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,810
You're from that runaway fam, aren't you?
Behind the serial thefts.

80
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,770
How's that kid, Doyoon, doing?

81
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,070
What else did you do there?

82
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,700
Did the boys make you
engage in prostitution?

83
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,530
- Let go!
-Take your hand off her!

84
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,160
What are you doing here?

85
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,500
Asking something like that

86
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,710
to a minor without parental consent is
a serious violation of her human rights.

87
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,500
Hana, go inside the room.

88
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,130
- Who are you?
- Team Leader Yeon.

89
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,510
Chief Baek.

90
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,680
Team Leader Yeon Juhyun of
the Women and Juvenile Affairs Division.

91
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,470
Director Choi.

92
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,140
I think we'll get some good attention
if we get a picture of you and the kids

93
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,690
along with the foundation's plan.

94
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,940
That isn't necessary.

95
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,020
That's enough.

96
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,110
You can do that later.
Let's call it a wrap for today.

97
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,320
Sure. Let's go.

98
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,710
Thank you.

99
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,000
By the way, I think Team Leader Yeon here

100
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,710
will have a lot to do
with your foundation from now on.

101
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,090
Hello, sir.

102
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,180
I'm Yeon Juhyun
of Geumo's Women and Juvenile Affairs.

103
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,140
I'm Choi Dohyung.

104
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,430
I guess I'll have to bother you
from now on.

105
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,650
It would really be an honor to help
a legendary officer such as yourself.

106
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
Detective Kim.

107
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,780
This is Lieutenant Kim Taekrok
of the Women and Juvenile Affairs.

108
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,000
Hello, ma'am.

109
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,420
Goodness.

110
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,420
You haven't shown up in so long.
I thought you were dead.

111
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,460
Take a seat.

112
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,890
So who's this?
I haven't seen him before.

113
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,850
Yes, he's a very successful man in Seoul.
He's even on TV sometimes.

114
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,220
Really?

115
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,890
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,600
I don't watch TV besides soap operas.

117
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,360
It's all right.

118
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,860
- We'll have the pollock soup.
- Sure.

119
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,490
I know all about
what kind of a man Kim Taekrok is.

120
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,160
I've been meaning to call.

121
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,830
I know.

122
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,420
You're not one not to reach out
when you clearly knew I was back.

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
How have you been?

124
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,340
From what I heard,
you've been through a lot.

125
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,220
Kook Jinhan, was it?

126
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,010
Were you close
with the dead chief investigation officer?

127
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,390
Close? No, we were just work colleagues.

128
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,600
I don't even want to think about it.

129
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,980
Okay.

130
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,690
You'll be retiring soon.
Forget about all the complicated stuff.

131
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,320
I thought you hated leaving the force,
but I guess life is good after retirement.

132
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,280
It is.

133
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,370
I sleep comfortably, eat comfortably,

134
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,450
and poop comfortably.

135
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,540
You're busier than that.

136
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,080
- Doing good deeds.
- Oh, not at all.

137
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,000
There's one thing nice
about being back in my hometown.

138
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,460
Sitting down with Kim Taekrok
and having a drink.

139
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,130
Here.

140
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,890
Right.

141
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,480
I heard you were close to the detective
who was injured in the explosion.

142
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Well...

143
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,950
I've known her since she was little.

144
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,660
I should've paid more attention.

145
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,490
You still haven't fixed
that habit of blaming yourself?

146
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,170
It's not rare for police officers
to get hurt or go crazy on the job.

147
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,170
Still, they all live on somehow.

148
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,380
Taekrok.

149
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,050
Jinseok is doing well too.

150
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,260
You know he got married, right?

151
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,640
He opened up a barbecue restaurant
in Yangpyeong last year.

152
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,940
His wife is really nice,
and I guess business is going well.

153
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,360
He looked really happy.

154
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,980
He worked hard on rehabilitation,

155
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,150
and now you can barely notice
he has a limp.

156
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,570
That's good.

157
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,080
He asks about you every time I visit.

158
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,160
He says he's moved on.
How much longer are you--

159
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,210
Dohyung. Try this pollock soup.

160
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,170
It's nice and spicy. It's good.

161
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,350
Stay in touch.

162
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,900
I let it slide when I was far away,
but not anymore when I'm close by. Okay?

163
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,440
All right. Hurry up and get inside.

164
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,770
Taekrok.

165
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,690
The past is the past.

166
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,150
Move on and only think
about the future, okay?

167
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,490
You and I, let's put down
the heavy load off our chests now.

168
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,580
Let's live an easy life, all right?

169
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,210
Sir, take good care of him.

170
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,130
Sure.

171
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,760
See you.

172
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,000
What do you think?

173
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,420
I think the fire was started
to get rid of the traces.

174
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,790
See the hole here?

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,250

176
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,390

177
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,220
<i><font color="#80FFFF">to get to the control panel
and reset the passcode.</i></font>

178
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,770
This is the work of a professional.

179
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,810
Petty thieves don't even touch
these things.

180
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,060
They don't know what's inside,
and it takes too long to unlock it.

181
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,270
It's a significant risk.

182
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,070
Then they were already after
what was inside the safe.

183
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,240
Yes, this was what they came for.

184
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,620
<i><font color="#80FFFF">If the thing Woo Jangik
is looking for was in his safe,</i></font>

185
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,370
someone else took it.

186
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,670
Hey, who was that earlier?

187
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,800
I don't know.
I didn't get a look at his face.

188
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,800
He ran away as soon as he saw me.

189
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,180
It felt like he knew who I was.

190
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,430
Darn. Is this gonna be another headache?

191
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,440
Dongbum.

192
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,360
Please keep what happened today
a secret from Taekrok.

193
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,360
Taekrok doesn't know about this?

194
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,480
Well...

195
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,280
I just want to tell him myself.

196
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,200
Well, all right.

197
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,530
I'll get going now.

198
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,450
- Okay.
- Yes.

199
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,830
- Thank you for today.
- It's nothing.

201

202
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,680
It feels like something's going on again.

203
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,390
It's all in the past.

204
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,640
-Detective Kim.
- Take your hands off this case.

205
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,790
Sir, what took you so long?

206
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,290
What about Detective Lee? Is she okay?

207
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,920
You should at least tell me
what's going on. We're family!

208
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,130
Family?

209
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,600
We're a community.

210
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,770
A community of neighbors.

211
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,770
I don't want to be family with you.

212
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,150
Just close the door.

213
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,380
You really...

214
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,670
have never met
with Chairman Jang in person?

215
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,170
No, I haven't.

216
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,930
So,

217
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,350
why did Chairman Jang kill Kook Jinhan
but let you live?

218
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,650

Yes.

No.

No.

Please sit.

261
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,500
I can tolerate a lot of things,

262
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,710
but this, I cannot.

263
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,460
"Geumo Police lacks presence."

264
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,260
I won't let Geumo Police Station
be treated like this.

265
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
Not under my leadership.

266
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,220
As of right now,
Homicide and Women and Juveniles

267
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,020
will act under joint investigations.

268
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,350
Back from the start.

269
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,640
From children to adults.

270
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,440
Go through everyone, dead and alive.

271
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Take care of the runaway teenagers

272
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,940
and find the arsonist at once.

273
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,320
Did the results come back? Is it arson?

274
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,780
Yes, we have
the identification results back.

275
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,700
And it's almost certain that it was arson.

276
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,750
I'll begin the briefing
on the Hoyong-ro office explosion.

277
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,880
The case overview.

278
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,460
I organized it according to time, date,
and location, as you see here.

279
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,420
We analyzed camera footage from the area.

280
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,720
But we haven't been able to find
any leads besides that.

281
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,140
And when we asked around
people in the neighborhood,

282
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,350
they said they had seen big thugs
go in and out of the victim's office

283
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,640
and that they hadn't seen them
since their last visit.

284
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,440
The victim is Woo Jangik,
age 39, as you can see here.

285
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,190
If you look at these pictures,

286
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,160
there is a timer, a high-capacity battery,
a heat cable, and a needle.

287
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,700
This here is the predicted diagram
of the explosive device.

288
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,990
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The culprit cut the hose</i></font>

289
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,330
<i><font color="#80FFFF">so that gas would slowly fill up
from the bottom.</i></font>

290
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,290
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And he stuck a needle
to the dial-type timer.</i></font>

291
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,090
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It starts ticking down.
After a certain time,</i></font>

292
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,800
<i><font color="#80FFFF">it makes contact
and the heating wire catches fire.</i></font>

293
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,050
Did Woo Jangik die from the fire?

294
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:16,140
The autopsy report isn't out yet,
so we don't know the exact cause of death.

295
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,190
That means he could have been murdered
before the gas explosion.

296
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,400
That's possible.

297
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,110
All right. Homicide, look through
all the security camera footage

298
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,400
nearby Woo Jangik's office
and report back to me.

299
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,110
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

300
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,860
What is Women and Juveniles going to do?

301
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,530
We plan on starting a fresh investigation

302
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,620
on all the runaway teenagers

303
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,370
who were involved
in the recent theft and arson.

304
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,910
All right.

305
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,210
What are you all doing? Get to work.

306
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,140
Lieutenant Kim.

307
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,310
Take Officer Gong

308
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,520
and go to the runaway fam hideout
at the redevelopment area.

309
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,440
Yes, ma'am.

310
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,940
I'll be outside.

311
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,150
Yes, all right.

312
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,280
Detective.

313
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,070
I trust that you already know this.

314
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,740
Just because the two teams are cooperating
doesn't mean you're back on Homicide.

315
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,290
All procedures and processes
of the investigation

316
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,170
happen under my orders.

317
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,960
I'll keep that in mind.

318
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,140
Gosh, she's so charismatic.

319
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,680
Seeing how you can't say anything
back to your team leader,

320
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,270
the rumor must be true.

321
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,850
What are you talking about?

322
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,060
Didn't you know?

323
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,690
I heard your team leader went to the chief
and asked to have you on her team.

324
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,160
DON'T JUST WATCH GEUMO BECOME A SLUM!
CONTINUE WITH REDEVELOPMENT!

325
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,170
Is this it?

326
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,420
-Hey.
- Yes?

327
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,550
I have to stop by somewhere.

328
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,220
Go take a look at the hideout
and get back.

329
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,640
By myself? Do you have any plans?

330
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,430
- It's none of your business.
- Excuse me? Detective Kim.

331
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,560
-Sir.
- What?

332
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,730
Thanks.

333
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,110
-Here.
- Thank you.

334
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,570
Our team is done

335
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,490
securing the whereabouts of the kids
in Hana's runaway fam.

336
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,490
- Okay.
- Now,

337
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,030
- we'll proceed with witness investigation.
- Wait.

338
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,910
- They're not suspects?
- Excuse me?

339
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
I mean, the teenagers have

340
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,420
the clearest motive
to do it in this situation.

341
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,000
They set the office on fire
because they kidnapped their friend.

342
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,960
Not until we have evidence.

343
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,180
Hey.

344
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,970
How did it go on our end?
Did we secure all CCTV footage?

345
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,640
Yes, we've secured all the footage
from the nearby security cameras.

346
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,730
I'm watching it
from 12 hours before the explosion.

347
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,280
What? Hold on.

348
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,740
I think I just saw something.
Can you rewind it just a little?

349
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,860
Okay.

350
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,620
No, just a little bit more.

351
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,950
Yes, this person.

352
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,880
Team Leader Han.

353
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:40,590
YOUNGSEO WELFARE FOUNDATION

354
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,950
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Yang Gitae...</i></font>

355
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,220
The fourth floor. Up there.

356
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,680
Get up there. Run.

357
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,980
NOEUL GOSIWON

358
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,860
Ah!

359
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,480
THE REQUIREMENTS OF LOVE
CAN THEY FALL IN LOVE WITHOUT THEM?

360
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,320
Kimchi.

361
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,570
Kimchi.

362
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,410
Kimchi.

363
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,240
Sour kimchi.

364
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,260
Is the lady okay?

365
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,170
Yeah.

366
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,840
She'll be back on her feet soon.

367
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:13,770
Hey, is there anything else
that you can tell me

368
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,610
besides what you told the police?

369
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,740
Even the tiniest detail would help.

370
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:35,080
He was the only one who listened
to what I said and believed me.

371
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,000
To tell you the truth...

372
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,050
These punks are being so loud.

373
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,010
Hey, I think he just had <i><font color="#80FFFF">ramyeon</i></font>.

374
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,350
- Take this hoodie, will you?
-Yes, sir.

375
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,440
- Gitae, come over here.
- I don't want to.

376
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,020
Come here as you're told, you punk.

377
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,900
Hurry and catch him.
What are you looking at?

378
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,480
You're dead when I catch you!

379
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:05,200
That night, before we went into the office
of the man who confined us,

380
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,740
I saw someone wearing a black hoodie.

381
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,160
A hoodie?

382
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:14,960
<i><font color="#80FFFF">If something really is missing,
that person must be the culprit.</i></font>

383
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,000
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Let go of me.</i></font>

384
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,880
-Yang Gitae. You listen up.
-Hold still.

385
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,000
You're being arrested for arson
and the murder of Woo Jangik. Got it?

386
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,760
What bullshit is that?

387
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,180
It's not me. Fuck! You brainless pigs!

388
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,140
What did you just say?

389
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,310
You brainless...

390
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,770
Hey, cover the security camera.

391
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,430
What? Don't cover it.

392
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,060
You little shit.

393
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,440
Hey. What did you just say?

394
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,230
- Wait. It hurts so much.
-What did you just say?

395
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,610
What? You piece of shit.

396
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,950
Come here, you goddamn piece of shit.

397
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,290
Fuck you.
It hurts, doesn't it? You son of a bitch.

398
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,750
I didn't tell the police
because they might say I made it up.

399
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,830
But it's true.

400
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,830
Did you see the person's face?

401
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,010
Hey, what's up?

402
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,220
Yang Gitae has been arrested
as the arson suspect.

403
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,640
-It hurts.
-<i><font color="#80FFFF">What are you talking about?</i></font>

404
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,100
On the day of the incident,
he was filmed near Woo Jangik's office.

405
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,490
Are you sure?

406
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,650
Yes, I'm sure.

407
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,410
He's still going through a retrial,

408
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,870
but he has a history as an arsonist
who set a homeless person on fire.

409
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,950
I'm sure.

410
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,540
The two of you

411
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,710
must get along well.

412
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,920
This was faster than I expected.

413
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,590
It's all thanks to Team Leader Han.

414
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,300
No, we did it together.

415
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,090
- By the way...
- Yes?

416
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,880
What happened to his face?

417
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,260
His face... When we were bringing
him outside, he fell on the stairs.

418
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,140
He kept resisting, so we lost our grip.

419
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,640
It's true.

420
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,530
He lives in the same apartment
as Lieutenant Kim Taekrok?

421
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,740
Yes.

422
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,280
Hmm.

423
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,410
Let's begin.

424
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,710
What did you bring him in for?

425
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,790
He was filmed on the security camera
near the victim's office

426
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,670
the night before the incident.

427
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,960
So we brought him in.

428
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,840
- Do you have evidence?
- What?

429
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,800
Anyone?

430
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,970
He's not the culprit just for being there.

431
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,270
- Is this how you do your job?
- Detective Kim.

432
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,310
A word, please.

433
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,530
He didn't do it.

434
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,240
What did the suspect say
when you arrested him?

435
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,370
I mean, he couldn't explain
why he was there at that hour.

436
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,500
I'm sure it was that jerk.
I have a strong hunch about this, Chief.

437
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,460
You investigate based on hunches?

438
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,540
Why do you keep trying to cover for him?

439
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,340
Seonga's laying there injured.

440
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,090
Don't you feel the need
to destroy whoever did it?

441
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,920
Or what, is there another reason?

442
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,090
- What?
- I mean, the way you're acting right now.

443
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,060
You're the one who was on the phone
with Seonga right before she got injured.

444
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,600
The former arsonist who was on the scene
ten hours before the incident occurred

445
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,730
is also someone close to you.

446
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,900
They're all connected to you, aren't they?

447
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,070
It's been concluded
that the arson murderer wasn't Yang Gitae.

448
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,190
He's going through a retrial right now.

449
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,200
The fact
that he's going through a retrial...

450
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,660
means that he hasn't been acquitted yet.

451
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,700
Right.

452
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,790
All right, settle down.

453
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,120
We're not suspecting you of anything,
Detective Kim.

454
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,460
You know that investigating one
with a history is a must.

455
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,920
This may simply be a formality,
but he is a close acquaintance of yours,

456
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,970
so I hope you don't interfere.

457
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,130
You understand what I mean, right?

458
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,020
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Gitae.</i></font>

459
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,560
It's you, right? You did it.

460
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,440
Hey, did you kill him
before you started the fire?

461
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,320
I have a right to remain silent.

462
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,570
You idiot.

463
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,740
The right to remain silent?
You think that's going to help you?

464
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,950
Be honest.

465
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,410
You went to Woo Jangik to make
a quick buck because he looked rich.

466
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,790
But he didn't welcome you,

467
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,500
so you killed him
and started the fire. Right?

468
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,170
I have nothing to say.

469
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:36,260
You think Kim Taekrok will have your back
because you live in the same apartment?

470
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,590
Is that it?

471
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,390
- Hey, you need to wake up.
- We're family.

472
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,270
What kind of family?

473
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,100
A community.

474
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,650
A community of neighbors.

475
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,940
- How does that make you family?
- We are family...

476
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,280
Yes. Did you get it restored?

477
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,450
This isn't easy.
It's at the top on the difficulty scale.

478
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,450
Hurry. Things have changed.
There's not much time.

479
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,960
I'm trying my best...

480
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,250
Hello?

481
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,840
This old man. Jeez!

482
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,820
I thought you quit smoking.

483
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,930
You know
why Yang Gitae was there, don't you?

484
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,350
Are you not going to tell me?

485
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,640
- What is it you want to hear from me?
- Anything.

486
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,520
The reason you're not doing anything

487
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,980
even while Seonga's hurt
and Yang Gitae is arrested.

488
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,440
Just one thing that I can understand.

489
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,910
Get off the case if you're going
to get emotional while investigating.

490
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,370
I saw someone in a black hoodie

491
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,580
when I stopped by Woo Jangik's office
last night.

492
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,540
When?

493
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,790
Around midnight.

494
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,630
Was that Yang Gitae, too?

495
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,260
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I saw someone wearing a black hoodie.</i></font>

496
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,310
The punk who did that to Seonga.

497
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,430
I'm going to catch them no matter what.

498
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,390
Whether it's Yang Gitae...

499
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,600
or anyone else.

500
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,500
These analog dials
are rarely used these days.

501
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,710
You know those terrorists
you see on international news?

502
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,550
Even they use digital timers.

503
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,760
Improvised explosive devices like this
are all digital.

504
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,020
If the maximum on this is 60 minutes,

505
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,810
it must have been set up
right before the explosion.

506
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,310
if you adjust the dial, it could be
60 hours, not just 60 minutes.

507
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,480
That means it can be set to ten hours too.

508
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,570
Yes, in theory.

509
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,530
I guess places that sell these
aren't common.

510
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,570
It'll be difficult to get
something like this on the internet.

511
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,330
Maybe you can try
the industrial tool complex...

512
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,790
If I ask around, I might be able
to find out where it was bought.

513
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,160
Right.

514
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,660
I should go tomorrow.

515
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,710
And...

516
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,420
- don't tell Taekrok I came today.
- I got it. I won't tell.

517
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
What's this?

518
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,970
This. It's...

519
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,810
I was asked to catch
someone's wife cheating.

520
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,600
Isn't that illegal?

521
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,140
You cops ask me to do worse.

522
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,650
Thank you.

523
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,980
- See you.
-Yes.

524
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,580
Yes. I'm ready.

525
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,050
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I restored it as you asked,</i></font>

526
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,050
<i><font color="#80FFFF">but is this for real?</i></font>

527
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,930

528
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,190
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Are you sure this is okay?</i></font>

529
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,470
Right. We do handle it.

530
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,140
We sold one just a few days ago.

531
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,230
Do you remember what the person
who bought it looked like?

532
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,940
Well... just an ordinary person.

533
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,480
How did they pay for it?

534
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,570
In cash.

535
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,110
I give ten percent discounts.

536
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,530
You wouldn't happen to have
a security camera here, would you?

537
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,240
Why wouldn't I?

538
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,330
What kind of store doesn't these days?

539
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,080
Then could I take the footage?

540
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,080
It's already been taken.

541
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,210
By who?

542
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,800
The police came and took it
before you came.

543
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,510
I mean, which police...

544
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,130
How would I know?

545
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,180
They asked for it saying they were police,
so I did.

546
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,400
Hey, where's the evidence list?

547
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,480
Excuse me?

548
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,360
Where's the evidence list
to Woo Jangik's case?

549
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,440
The Woo Jangik case...

550
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,200
The evidence list...

551
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,490
Here.

552
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,950
LIST OF ITEMS FOR ANALYSIS

553
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,160
What? Is this it?

554
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,750
Yes.

555
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,830
What about footage from the tool shop?

556
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm not following.

557
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,710
I managed the evidence this whole time,
and there was nothing like that.

558
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,590
All right.

559
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,990
These are from the last ten years.

560
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,490
There are juvenile crimes
involving theft and arson.

561
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:17,330
They're in such disarray, aren't they?
I'm sorry about that.

562
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,160
Anyway, please organize them,
starting with the ones

563
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,790
that are most relevant to our case.

564
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,550
I will.

565
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,270
I'm surprised.

566
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,900
The colleague you're most fond of
got hurt.

567
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,530
The acquaintance you were taking care of
was accused of arson.

568
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,660
You seem too calm, given the situation.

569
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,830
I'm not in Homicide anymore.

570
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,370
What more can I do?

571
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,080
Seonga will wake up,
and Yang Gitae will be freed.

572
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,920
Yes, well...

573
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,260
I'm glad you think that way.

574
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,640
I heard you were the one who recognized
Yang Gitae on the security camera footage.

575
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,510
Yes.

576
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,390
I could hardly tell
because the picture was too blurry.

577
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,020
How did you recognize him right away?

578
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,480
I was really impressed
by an article I read.

579
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,610
About the arsonist who was vindicated

580
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,030
thanks to the detective
who put him behind bars.

581
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,330
You have a good memory!

582
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,580
Anyway, please keep it up.

583
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,750
Sure.

588
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,870
<i><font color="#80FFFF">was Taekrok.</i></font>

589
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,370
Ah!

590
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:26,210
Slow down.

591
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,790
I was starving to death.

592
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,550
I like white soup better, but still.

593
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,880
This is so good.

594
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,430
Don't you resent Taekrok?

595
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,030
It's just me in here.

596
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,320
Are you aware?

597
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,210
Still, what can I do about it?

598
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:11,500
He said he'd have it resolved soon,
so all I can do is wait.

599
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,300
It's not like he'd ask me
such a favor without good reason.

600
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,960
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I have a favor to ask.</i></font>

601
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,480
Still, it was risky this time.

602
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,520
He should have done it himself.
Don't you think so?

603
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,810
Picking the lock and installing a spy cam
is a piece of cake.

604
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,570
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I was just unlucky getting caught.</i></font>

605
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,660
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Spy cam?</i></font>

606
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,540
A spy camera?

607
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:51,040
Taekrok didn't mention that to you?

608
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,670
Maybe it got burnt,
so he got nothing out of it.

609
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,380
Darn it.

610
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,000
That's no good.

615

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Why do you ask?</i></font>

616
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,180
It's nothing.

617
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,850
