1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:11,750
<i>Do I dare ask what
calamity must have transpired</i>

2
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,917
to bring you home to me?

3
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:21,000
How do you explain
Mr. Fury's presence in Moscow?

4
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:23,750
They sent you to fire me?

5
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,333
I volunteered.

6
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:28,042
That mess that you created in Moscow
that resulted in getting

7
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,417
<i>one of our best people murdered?</i>

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,458
You earned all this smoke, brother.

9
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,365
<i>At the Council meeting,</i>

10
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:37,500
I told you I had a plan
for taking Earth as our own.

11
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:40,958
<i>The heroes of Earth will react.</i>

12
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:46,333
<i>The only way we can counter that
is to become super ourselves.</i>

13
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:48,042
<i>All of us.</i>

14
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:49,875
Super Skrulls.

15
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:51,042
<i>G'iah.</i>

16
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,250
Run.

17
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:59,167
- Go on, turn around.
- No.

18
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,333
Are you a leader of Skrulls

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,375
or our worst enemy?

20
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,343
<i>St. James Church,
one hour.</i>

21
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:08,833
As I was watching all the news coverage
of those guys'

22
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:12,042
heroics over in the States,
strangest thing,

23
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:14,250
I kept having this feeling

24
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:18,125
that someone I know had something to do
with getting them all together.

25
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:24,125
And what if it was someone you know?

26
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,333
Wouldn't surprise me.

27
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,167
Why is that?

28
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:33,750
Because if he's the man I think he is,
he has a powerful sense of righteousness.

29
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:40,208
He understands that the universe
is a dangerous place.

30
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,375
That home is worth fighting for.

31
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,292
And that the weak are worth protecting.

32
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,625
Good book?

33
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:56,333
It's a collection of poems.

34
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,083
Raymond Carver.

35
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,500
- You familiar?
- Nah. More of a history guy myself.

36
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,792
He's known for his brevity.

37
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,500
I mean, some of his poems
are just three or four lines,

38
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:12,500
but they pack a punch.

39
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,042
Do you have a favorite?

40
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,750
It's called <i>Late Fragment.</i>

41
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,125
Hmm. How's it go?

42
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,667
Uh...

43
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,875
Actually, it's a conversation
between two people.

44
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,458
You read the first line.

45
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,917
"And did you get
what you wanted from this life,

46
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:40,750
"even so?"

47
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
"I did."

48
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,583
"And what did you want?"

49
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,375
"To call myself beloved,

50
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:57,333
"to feel myself beloved on the earth."

51
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,208
- Fury was fired a couple of days ago.
- Fired?

52
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
How'd that happen?

53
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,333
President Ritson must have found out
he was in Moscow.

54
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:06,667
President Ritson
doesn't find out that the sun's come up

55
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,833
unless I brief him.

56
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,208
I fired Fury, okay?

57
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:13,417
No, I'm sorry, correction,
I DDT'd that dude from the top rope.

58
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,250
Yeah, it was like Undertaker level.
It was really impressive.

59
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:20,458
I don't understand. If it was you...

60
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,750
If it was Gravik,
then why does he need me?

61
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,417
What Gravik needs,
what Gravik doesn't need,

62
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,000
that's none of your concern.

63
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,625
I'm the one telling you to kill Fury.

64
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,917
I'll make it easy for you.

65
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,583
<i>One of the two occupants
of that lovely country manor of yours</i>

66
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,583
<i>is catching a bullet today.</i>

67
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,792
You can flip a coin for all I care.

68
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,167
He's broken.

69
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,958
He's been broken
ever since he came back from the Blip.

70
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:57,792
The old Fury, the one with power,

71
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,792
<i>the one with ability,
the one who was indispensable to us,</i>

72
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,917
<i>that Fury's gone.</i>

73
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,292
<i>Now this new one,</i>

74
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:08,833
<i>he'll be dead from exhaustion
and defeat soon enough.</i>

75
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:10,625
<i>We don't need to kill him.</i>

76
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,083
Priscilla.

77
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,167
You keep telling me
what you're not gonna do,

78
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,208
I'm gonna show you what I am going to.

79
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,333
Now you enjoy this concert.

80
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,042
We have a problem.

81
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:47,958
Oh, yeah?

82
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:49,125
What's that?

83
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,167
Take a look around, G.
There's a reason G'iah isn't here with us.

84
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,750
She's the mole.

85
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,125
I've already taken care of her.

86
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,583
Yes, sir.

87
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:01,792
Hey! Remember, we want them to think
it's the Russians.

88
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,167
Make it big, loud,
like the Russians would.

89
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,750
Yeah, that's cargo only.

90
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Steady now.

91
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:28,958
I should never ever
have forced you into this,

92
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,875
and I am so sorry.

93
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,500
I don't need your sorrow or pity
for anything I did of my own free will.

94
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,417
The reason I'm with you now

95
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,333
is because with you, Dad...

96
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,667
It's the only answer
to the question of where I belong.

97
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,833
The only thing that I need from you

98
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:01,083
is a plan.

99
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:05,833
Once and for all, Dad,

100
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,917
what is your plan
for finding our people a home?

101
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,208
Because Gravik
has already implemented his,

102
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:14,542
and it works.

103
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,917
Okay.

104
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,750
First, we take down the insurgency.

105
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,292
You, me, Fury.

106
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,708
Once that's done, we go to the President.

107
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,958
And we have a big bargaining chip.

108
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,208
And we tell him,

109
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:38,500
"Guess what? Just saved your planet.
Now give me a little something in return."

110
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,875
And we wait and see what can happen next.
All right?

111
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:46,500
And I believe that I can secure an amnesty

112
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,875
for the one million of us to remain.

113
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,333
Don't you want to live in your own skin?

114
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,125
Of course I do.

115
00:11:57,167 --> 00:12:00,417
But we have to deal with reality.

116
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,417
G'iah, we're a people without a planet.

117
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,458
We depend on the goodwill of our hosts.

118
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:11,542
We just have to keep showing them
who we are.

119
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:16,083
We just keep contributing,
show them our hearts.

120
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,708
They will see us.

121
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,083
You are delusional.

122
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,750
That's not who we are.

123
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,625
And that is not who I've become.

124
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,750
G'iah.

125
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:45,417
G'iah!

126
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:27,333
- Didn't think you'd be home until later.
- Surprise.

127
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,208
- Tea?
- Sure, I'll take a cup.

128
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,583
What's the matter? Your fingers swell up?

129
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,083
You're not wearing your wedding ring.

130
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:40,875
Oh!

131
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,125
Came in the back way, slipped my mind.

132
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,667
Does that mean you're coming or going?

133
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,750
Going.

134
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,083
One of those
"Fury, we need you at work" things.

135
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,375
- Know what I mean?
- I know how it is.

136
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:26,667
Of all the dumbass, wrongheaded,

137
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:31,667
reckless things I've done in my life,

138
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:38,375
you are by far and away

139
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,417
the greatest mistake.

140
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,208
I lost all my reason to be your husband.

141
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,708
Ignored every signal
in my head, heart and body

142
00:14:57,792 --> 00:15:00,917
that screamed, "Stop!"

143
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,625
Even now, as I sit here,

144
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,917
knowing you plan to kill me
with that pistol of yours,

145
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,875
I don't know that if I had a chance
to do it over again,

146
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,750
that I'd do anything different.

147
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,583
Would you tell me the story? About how you

148
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:46,875
chose her?

149
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:55,792
Dr. Priscilla Davis
had a congenital heart defect.

150
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,792
She was keeping it a secret.

151
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,000
Didn't want the people she loved
gathered around for months,

152
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,708
watching her die in a hospital.

153
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,208
And I would visit her in her room
almost every day towards the end,

154
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,542
and we became quite close.

155
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,125
But at some point,

156
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,792
I had to acknowledge the truth of

157
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,792
what I was actually doing there

158
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,042
- in the first place.
- Which was?

159
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,042
Looking for someone
who would slip your defenses.

160
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:28,792
Ah.

161
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,292
So you were playing the long game on me,
even then.

162
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,708
Don't do that, Nick.

163
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:40,792
One day the doctor came in and told me
that it would be just a matter of hours.

164
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,542
I decided to just come out and ask.

165
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,417
You asked if you could assume her life?

166
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,250
I asked if she wanted to fall in love.

167
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,208
She wanted to know how, of course.

168
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,417
And I told her about you.

169
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,167
She made me make her three promises.

170
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:05,083
One,

171
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,417
that I would bury her at sea, which I did.

172
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,125
Two,

173
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,125
that I would continue
to be a daughter to her parents.

174
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,583
- Which you've also done.
- Mmm-hmm.

175
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,083
Three?

176
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,167
That I would never hurt you.

177
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,792
Sorry, darling.

178
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,333
"And did you get

179
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,875
"what you wanted from this life, even so?"

180
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,292
"I did."

181
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,125
"And what did you want?"

182
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,125
"To call myself beloved."

183
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,292
- "To feel myself...
- "Myself...

184
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:22,500
- "...beloved on the earth"
- "...beloved on the earth."

185
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:40,542
I'm not sure if this means
we should get divorced,

186
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,333
or we should renew our vows.

187
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,042
They'll be coming for you.

188
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,042
I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself.

189
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:02,000
Would you have loved me
if I'd never changed?

190
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,542
If I'd been my true self?

191
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,375
Guess we'll never know.

192
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,750
Fury, what the hell?

193
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,167
You mind telling me
what the hell you're doing in here?

194
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,500
Memory serves, I shit-canned you
into oblivion a few days ago.

195
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,417
I didn't like the way we left things
between us the other day, you know?

196
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:27,958
I mean, for real, though, you know,
us brothers gotta stick together.

197
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:29,250
You know what I mean?

198
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,292
Uh-huh. And you thought you'd
demonstrate that by breaking and entering?

199
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,500
I wanted to share
my favorite liquid lunch with you.

200
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:38,833
{\an8}Pappy Van Winkle.

201
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,708
{\an8}Twenty-three years
of distilled perfection.

202
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,917
I figured we could settle our beef
like, you know, proper gentlemen.

203
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,417
Mmm! Mmm, mmm, mmm!

204
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,667
Pappy! You done outdid yourself
on this one.

205
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,042
This the real thing?

206
00:20:56,542 --> 00:21:00,792
$5,000 worth of 24 carat liquid gold.

207
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,542
- Should I be worried about poison?
- Poison? No! Nanotechs.

208
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,083
Nanotech.

209
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:12,083
Maybe I should pour this out,
make myself a fresh one.

210
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,458
You do whatever
makes you feel comfortable.

211
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:16,958
But let me tell you,

212
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:21,250
if you waste one drop
of this Family Reserve,

213
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,958
I guarantee you, your ancestors
will reach out from the beyond

214
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:28,292
and strangle your Black ass.

215
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,958
Mmm.

216
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:35,417
Okay.

217
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,917
You wanna tell me
the real reason you're here?

218
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,083
Can't get nothing by you. Huh?

219
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,667
Aside from really wanting to squash
this beef between us...

220
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,875
- I stopped by...
- You broke in.

221
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,083
Broke in, to tell you...

222
00:21:57,042 --> 00:22:01,417
There are Skrulls
inside the U.S. government.

223
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:03,667
This again?

224
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:06,792
Skrulls in my security detail,
in the U.S. government,

225
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,333
there are Skrulls everywhere?

226
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:10,708
- I have it on excellent authority...
- Mmm-hmm.

227
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:15,625
That there is a Skrull mole
very close to the President.

228
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:18,958
Wow. Really? How close?

229
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,917
As close as you and I are
right now, uh, closer.

230
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,292
- That's a wild story.
- Ain't it now?

231
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,125
But here's the kicker.

232
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:37,750
All you got to do
to keep my mouth shut about all this,

233
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,500
give me my job back.

234
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,042
You mind if I make a counter?

235
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:46,917
Mmm!

236
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,375
You see this all right?

237
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:05,792
Oof! That's bad.

238
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,417
And that's you.

239
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,875
You and I both know

240
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:11,542
that's Gravik.

241
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,583
Come on.

242
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:17,417
Is that really what you're gonna go with
at your trial?

243
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,583
The alien defense?

244
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,083
"No, Your Honor. That's not me.

245
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:24,750
"That's a six-foot tall, bald, Black,
one-eyed extraterrestrial."

246
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,208
Good luck with that.

247
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,667
Look, I don't want you to worry, okay?

248
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,083
I'm gonna do everything in my power
to protect you,

249
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:35,583
to keep this video, and you know
all the copies that I made under wraps.

250
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:38,333
But I can't have you running around

251
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,750
spouting wild conspiracies,

252
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,083
and I certainly can't have you

253
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:45,292
breaking into my hotel suite,
threatening me.

254
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,792
But what I can have
is the rest of this Pappy,

255
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,208
'cause, baby, this is fire.

256
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:53,292
Now, why don't you hobble
your ancient ass on out of here

257
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,125
before I have you defenestrated?

258
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,000
Liquid location tracker.

259
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:16,875
It's not a bad idea.

260
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:48,583
- Welcome to England, Mr. President.
- Colonel Rhodes.

261
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,000
Hope you had a restful flight.

262
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:53,208
Most important negotiation
since the Cuban Missile Crisis,

263
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,750
yeah, I slept like a baby.

264
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:55,875
Point taken, sir.

265
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:58,500
There's a full briefing book for you
inside Stagecoach.

266
00:24:58,583 --> 00:24:59,958
One word if I may.

267
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:04,917
The key thing about the Russians
is you have to project strength.

268
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,083
There's an old Lenin quote,

269
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,792
Vladimir, not John.

270
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,542
"When you find flesh, you push.

271
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:15,208
"When you find steel, you stop."

272
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,333
You gotta be steel, sir.

273
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,042
Colonel, can I ask you something?

274
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:22,542
Absolutely anything, sir.

275
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:27,625
Did you pre-game
for our bilateral with the Russians

276
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:29,333
with a half-bottle of bourbon?

277
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:33,375
I'm not sure
I understand the question, sir.

278
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,667
Let's make sure the Colonel here

279
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,417
has a large coffee for the road.

280
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:47,917
Hmm.

281
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,000
Get me a mint.

282
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:51,292
Yes, sir.

283
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:53,667
Get the door.

284
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,417
Giddy up.

285
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:30,000
We're in transit to the summit.
Citadel is in position number four.

286
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:10,000
- Two o'clock!
- Incoming!

287
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,290
Fire! Fire! Fire!

288
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,163
Go ahead and fire!

289
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:16,042
Confirm, Citadel is alive.

290
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,750
<i>- I repeat, Citadel is alive.</i>
- This way!

291
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:27,042
- Enemy in sight!
- Taking heavy fire.

292
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:38,708
No question, it's the Russians!

293
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:40,833
- Watch your six.
- Cover!

294
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:59,667
The Russians are advancing!

295
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,875
Get down!

296
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:13,583
Go! Ten o'clock.

297
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,458
Watch the chopper!

298
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:17,833
Two and twelve.
Two and twelve. Advance.

299
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,083
Bloody hell, Fury. It's a kill zone.

300
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:25,042
Whole planet will be a kill zone
if we don't save Ritson.

301
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,583
Fire! Fire! Fire!

302
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:58,375
Defend Citadel!

303
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,708
Move!

304
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:01,250
Fury inbound.

305
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,458
Ten o'clock!

306
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,417
Fury's here.

307
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:14,917
Cover the Stagecoach!

308
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,083
Take this mag!

309
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,375
South side!

310
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:19,667
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

311
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,417
Fury. Fury's here.

312
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,667
- Reinforcements here, sir.
- Fury.

313
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:40,417
- Cover up!
- More men coming, sir!

314
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,125
Move! Move! Move!

315
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:45,000
Get to the president's car.

316
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,875
- Go, go, go!
- Hold the line.

317
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,208
<i>Requesting backup.
Repeat, requesting backup.</i>

318
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:52,333
Let's go!

319
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,500
Sniper!

320
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,750
Mr. President? Sir?

321
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,500
- He's out.
- I've got this. Stand back, man.

322
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:07,375
Reinforcements now!

323
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,583
Take care of Talos. Now!

324
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:32,833
The Russians are still coming!

325
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:34,542
Russians, two o'clock!

326
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,583
They're still advancing!

327
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:48,583
He's a bloody alien.
He's trying to get to Ritson!

328
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:51,250
No, no, no! Hold your fire! He's with me.

329
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,167
- He's with us.
- Where are those helos?

330
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:07,417
<i>Alpha, Bravo, Tango,
get those choppers in here, now!</i>

331
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,875
Reclaim your positions.

332
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,417
Where are they?

333
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:25,667
President's out of the vehicle!

334
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,333
Cover the President!

335
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,083
Talos, hang in there.
I'll be back for you.

336
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,917
- Put him in my car.
- I got my own ride.

337
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,583
Come on, I've got you.

338
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:46,750
I got you.

339
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:50,042
Come on. I got you.

340
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,667
Fire!

341
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,958
I'm hit.

342
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:01,375
Put him down.

343
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:08,875
I said put him down, now!

344
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,750
No!

345
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:31,750
Reinforcements are here!

346
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,458
Here they come, lads!
