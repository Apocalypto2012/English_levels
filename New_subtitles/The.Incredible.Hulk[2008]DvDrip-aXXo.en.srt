1
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,179
Is it ready?

2
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,539
<i>Hey! That's a great punch.</i>

3
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,859
Fear no good.
So emotion and control.

4
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,572
Breathe. Breathe.

5
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,615
Wait.

6
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,569
Okay.

7
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,372
I can make it work for a while,
but you need...

8
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,250
Okay. Okay.

9
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,290
Shut that off! Turn it off!

10
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,094
Watch out!

11
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,009
Okay!

12
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,852
That's not right.

13
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,894
Oh, you.

14
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,695
You see that? See that?
My ticket out of here.

15
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,934
Damn it!

16
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,972
Here's something
a bit more interesting.

17
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,214
It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.

18
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,099
<i>A man drank one of those guarana sodas.</i>

19
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,450
<i>Guess it had a little more kick</i>
<i>than he was looking for.</i>

20
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,689
Wow.

21
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,778
- Where was it bottled?
- Porto Verde, Brazil.

22
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,530
Have our people look for a white man
at the bottling plant.

23
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,851
Tell them no contact!
If he even sees them, he's gone!

24
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,053
I got you who I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality.

25
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,099
And I pulled you one ace.

26
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,138
Emil Blonsky.
Born in Russia, raised in England.

27
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,895
And on loan to SOCOM
from the Royal Marines.

28
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,849
I know you
cashed in some chips for this, Joe.

29
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,773
Glad I could help. Just make it good.

30
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,455
This is the target and the location.
Snatch and grab, live capture.

31
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,371
You'll have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance,

32
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,690
but live fire is for backup only.

33
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,294
We got local out there,
but we want it tight and quiet.

34
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,938
Is he a fighter?

35
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,090
Your target is a fugitive
from the US government

36
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,330
who stole military secrets.

37
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,811
He is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists,

38
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,575
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper
and possibly two Canadian hunters.

39
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,618
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!

40
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,419
Tranq him and bring him back.

41
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,733
Oh, come on.

42
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,369
Camera.

43
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,975
Here we go.

44
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,579
Get rid of the damn dog.

45
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,935
Take him!

46
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,012
Target's on the move.

47
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,369
Where is he?

48
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,654
He's on the ground.

49
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,412
- Let's go!
- Go!

50
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,209
Move, move!

51
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,458
Go, go, go!

52
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,253
Go! Go!

53
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,738
Clear everyone out!

54
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,055
Do not lose him!

55
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,212
Oh! No!

56
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,135
Get around behind him!

57
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,134
Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.

58
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,374
Oh, no.

59
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,451
You got to be kidding me.

60
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,970
<i>- Where is he?</i>
- Target acquired.

61
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,415
Gringo!

62
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,209
Let's go.

63
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,409
No!

64
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,659
Please! No!

65
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,333
Not the computer!

66
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,899
Gimme that! No!

67
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,733
You bad angry, G?
I very bad angry.

68
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,409
Oh, no.

69
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,174
You don't understand! Something really bad
is about to happen here!

70
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,371
Anybody else seeing this?

71
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,971
We've got a bogey
of some kind. Please advice.

72
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,893
That is the target!
Use every tranq you've got!

73
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,459
<i>Do it now!</i>

74
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,169
Go live! Go live! Go live!

75
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,978
Move!
- Get out of the way!

76
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,569
No!

77
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,255
It's behind us! Move! Move!

78
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,728
Get him!

79
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,449
Shoot!

80
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,730
Leave me alone.

81
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,249
No! No!

82
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,608
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.

83
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,930
He had it on him when he bolted.

84
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,011
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?

85
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,653
She is no longer a factor.

86
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,050
We closed that door to him a long time ago.
He's alone.

87
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,019
He wants to be alone.
But see if he's been talking to anybody.

88
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,058
Forgive me, sir?

89
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,377
Doesn't anybody want to talk
about what went down in there? 'Cause...

90
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,099
He didn't lose us.

91
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,809
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.

92
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,130
And then something hit us, something...

93
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,939
Something big hit us!

94
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,011
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!

95
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,450
It was the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.

96
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,858
Well, it's gone.

97
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,698
Well, if Banner knows what it is,

98
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,772
I'm gonna track him down,
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat

99
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,612
- and I'm gonna...
- That was Banner.

100
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,329
It

101
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,259
was Banner.

102
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,374
- You have to explain that statement, sir.
- No, I don't.

103
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,452
You've done a good job.

104
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,899
Pack up and get our men on a plane.
We're going home.

105
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,775
Wait.

106
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,534
Please.

107
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,819
Where am I?

108
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,858
I've run into bad situations
on crap missions before.

109
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,009
I've seen good men go down

110
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,217
purely because someone didn't let us know
what we were walking into.

111
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,570
I've moved on to the next one,
because that's what we do, right?

112
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,979
I mean, that's the job.

113
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,209
But this?

114
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,699
This is a whole new level of weird.

115
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,533
And I don't feel inclined
to step away from it.

116
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,532
So if you're taking another crack at him,
I want in.

117
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,295
And, with respect, you should be looking
for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,

118
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,371
because if that thing shows up again,

119
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,975
you're gonna have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants.

120
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,650
Sir.

121
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,852
<i>Tienes más</i> stretchy?

122
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,730
<i>Yeah. Perfecto.</i>

123
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,855
Let me emphasise
that what I'm about to share with you

124
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,137
is tremendously sensitive,
both to me personally and the Army.

125
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,932
You're aware that we've got an
Infantry Weapons Development programme.

126
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,457
Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram

127
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,008
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.

128
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,818
Yeah, Super Soldier.

129
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,215
Yes.

130
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,176
An oversimplification, but yes.

131
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,734
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing
serious work again, bold work.

132
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,414
Across the hall,
they were trying to arm you better.

133
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,616
We were tryin' to make you better.

134
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:35,014
Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application.

135
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,568
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.

136
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,732
I would never have told him
what the project really was.

137
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,257
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.

138
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,013
And something went very wrong.

139
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,177
Or it went very right.

140
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,893
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.

141
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,813
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?

142
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,936
- No.
- But you were. You were, weren't you?

143
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,931
You were trying other things.

144
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,773
One serum we developed

145
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,254
was very promising.

146
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,854
- So why did he run?
- He's a scientist.

147
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,938
He is not one of us.

148
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,059
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45?
- 39.

149
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,250
- It takes a toll, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

150
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,534
So get out of the trenches.

151
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,975
You should be a Colonel by now,
with your record.

152
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,133
No, I'm a fighter.
I'll be one for as long as I can.

153
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,292
You know, if I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had ten years ago,

154
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,019
that would be someone
I wouldn't want to fight.

155
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,693
I could probably arrange
something like that.

156
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,732
Take care, kids.

157
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,979
Stan, I give you my word,

158
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,698
whatever you've heard about me,
it's not true.

159
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,817
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.

160
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,539
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.

161
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,133
- Have you talked to her?
- No.

162
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,370
She doesn't know that I'm here.

163
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,298
- She's with somebody?
- Yeah, he's a head shrink.

164
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,656
They say he's one of the best.
But a really nice guy.

165
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,378
Good. That's good.

166
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:48,090
- Bruce, what can I do to help you?
- I could use a bed for a few nights.

167
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,889
- You can have the spare room upstairs.
- That'd be so great.

168
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,775
There is one other thing.

169
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,372
Excuse me. Pardon me.

170
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,333
Coming through.

171
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,611
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.

172
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,933
I don't think there's anybody up there.

173
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:17,298
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell
if I don't collect. You got to let me try.

174
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,610
I'll tell you what. I got an extra medium.
Take it on the house.

175
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,212
- You are the man.
- God bless you, brother.

176
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,729
All right.

177
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,169
Okay.

178
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,975
We're pretty well closed here, folks.
I'm sorry.

179
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,369
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.

180
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,138
Oh, kids.

181
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,690
I got nothing but marinara now.

182
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,736
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.

183
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,936
She worked through dinner again,
of course.

184
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,409
Stan?

185
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,932
And he... I go, "So, yeah,
I mean, where were you?

186
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,976
"I can't... I don't know
where you were, Cecil."

187
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,449
And he goes, "Not where you been at."

188
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,089
I thought, "Oh, my God." I just felt so awful.

189
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,893
Bruce?

190
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,132
Betty? What's going on?

191
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,929
Betty...

192
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,978
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.

193
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,769
- I don't know what to say.
- Please, just tell me the truth.

194
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,974
Don't go. Don't go.

195
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,297
I want you to come with me now.

196
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,496
Please. Come with me.

197
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,054
Please.

198
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,419
It's our data.

199
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,218
I got in there before they carted it all away.

200
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,895
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us
something someday.

201
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:04,611
- Does the General know that you have this?
- No, I don't think so.

202
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,930
I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.

203
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,453
You have to be sure.

204
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:13,375
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't
just go in there together and talk to him.

205
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,215
He told me what he wanted to do.
He wants it out of me.

206
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,417
He wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it.

207
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,570
He wants to make it a weapon.

208
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,648
- Hi.
- Hi.

209
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,494
- I thought you might want to...
- Thanks.

210
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,736
Listen, I should leave early,
as early as I can.

211
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,096
Really? You can't stay at all?

212
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,377
I want to,
but it's just not safe for me to be here.

213
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,459
- If I could borrow some cash...
- Of course.

214
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,098
I need to take a bus.

215
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,774
Well, at least let me walk you to the station.

216
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,729
Okay.

217
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,809
- You have everything you need?
- Yeah.

218
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,895
I...

219
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,295
What?

220
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,571
- Good night.
- Good night.

221
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,571
I hope you get some rest.

222
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,494
We're giving you a very low dose only.

223
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,380
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.

224
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,371
First sign of any side effect,

225
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,975
we stop and you're off team
until you straighten out.

226
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,412
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

227
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,819
You'll get two separate infusions.

228
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,939
One into the deep muscle,
one into the bone marrow centres.

229
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,215
The bone ones are going to hurt.

230
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,612
Is everything okay?

231
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,819
I think so.

232
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,134
Come here.

233
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,696
- I just wanna do this.
- Oh.

234
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,816
- It's better like that.
- Yeah?

235
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,853
It feels too tight, huh?

236
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,658
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.

237
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,698
- What?
- They're here.

238
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,373
- Betty, look at me, look at me!
- Bruce!

239
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,654
You have to go far away
from me as you can!

240
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,173
- Don't argue with me, just go. Go!
- Bruce!

241
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,936
Damn it! We'd have had snipers on target
in three more minutes.

242
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,499
I wanna know who jumped the gun.

243
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:54,809
He's heading 2-7-0.

244
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,852
Blonsky! Not yet!

245
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,375
Sir.

246
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,498
Look alive. This could get interesting.

247
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,575
I got him!

248
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,818
Stop! Stop!

249
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,899
I know you're in there!

250
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,218
General, please!

251
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,609
Sir?

252
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,255
Dad!

253
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:31,379
- Dad, please don't do this.
- You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.

254
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,212
There he is!

255
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,416
<i>Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.</i>

256
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,570
Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage!

257
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,539
He's locked in.

258
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,779
Put two canisters in there with him.

259
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,449
Fire!

260
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,895
Get her back here!

261
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,969
Now she'll see.

262
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,969
Alpha team?

263
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,935
Let him have all of it.

264
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,373
Come on, light him up!

265
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,697
Where are the fifty cals? Move your asses!

266
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,049
Oh, my God!

267
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,529
Blonsky, now you're up!

268
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,289
Sir?

269
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,648
Cover me.

270
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,453
Remember me?

271
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,939
My God, he's doing it.

272
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,054
Move him toward the cannons!

273
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,975
Move!

274
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,134
Hold your position!

275
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,494
Do it now!

276
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,779
Please, please, please, no!

277
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,213
- Please, please, please!
- Get her back!

278
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,289
You're killing him!

279
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,610
Stop! Get off of me!

280
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,053
Bruce!

281
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:09,775
Bruce! Bruce!

282
00:53:37,941 --> 00:53:38,930
Where's the gunship?

283
00:53:58,301 --> 00:53:59,336
Is that it?

284
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:01,259
Blonsky, pull back now.

285
00:54:01,341 --> 00:54:02,569
<i>Pull back!</i>

286
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:07,299
Is that all you got?

287
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:17,009
- Fall back!
- Fall back! Let's go, let's go!

288
00:54:17,101 --> 00:54:18,420
Find cover!

289
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:23,410
Betty!

290
00:54:36,341 --> 00:54:37,774
Fire, goddamn it!

291
00:54:39,501 --> 00:54:40,650
Bruce?

292
00:54:53,301 --> 00:54:54,450
Stop firing!

293
00:55:07,461 --> 00:55:08,814
No!

294
00:55:56,901 --> 00:55:59,335
You did the right thing, calling us.

295
00:56:01,381 --> 00:56:04,179
I need to know where they're going.

296
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:06,331
She'll be in incredible danger
as long as she's with him.

297
00:56:06,421 --> 00:56:07,649
From who?

298
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:11,015
He protected her. You almost killed her.

299
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:14,696
I give you my word, her safety
is my main concern at this point.

300
00:56:14,781 --> 00:56:17,375
You know, it's a point
of professional pride with me

301
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:20,259
that I can always tell
when somebody's lying.

302
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:21,616
And you are.

303
00:56:22,861 --> 00:56:25,011
I don't know where he's going.

304
00:56:25,941 --> 00:56:29,934
- I know she'll help him, if she can.
- Then she's aiding a fugitive.

305
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:33,615
And I can't help either one of them.

306
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:41,419
I used to wonder
why she never talked about you.

307
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:43,100
Now I know!

308
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,051
Where does she meet these guys?

309
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:38,656
Bruce?

310
00:57:48,461 --> 00:57:49,576
Bruce.

311
00:58:08,941 --> 00:58:11,011
It's okay. It's okay.

312
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:26,260
Come here. Come this way.

313
00:58:29,341 --> 00:58:30,899
Watch your head.

314
00:58:45,381 --> 00:58:46,450
Okay.

315
00:58:56,821 --> 00:58:57,936
We're okay.

316
00:59:02,661 --> 00:59:03,980
It's okay.

317
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:07,379
It's just the rain.

318
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,377
Will he ever walk again?

319
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:21,897
Most of the bones in his body
look like crushed gravel right now.

320
00:59:21,981 --> 00:59:25,610
I will say this for him.
He's got a heart like a machine.

321
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:28,773
Never seen anything like it,
outside of a racehorse.

322
01:00:28,781 --> 01:00:29,850
Here.

323
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:32,456
Okay.

324
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:12,610
Bruce?

325
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:15,255
Oh, hi.

326
01:01:15,821 --> 01:01:16,890
Are you okay?

327
01:01:17,501 --> 01:01:18,570
Yeah.

328
01:01:18,781 --> 01:01:20,931
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.

329
01:01:21,021 --> 01:01:23,489
- Good.
- I just had to get my data back.

330
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:26,050
You ate it?

331
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:30,214
Well, you know, the circumstances
called for a little improvisation.

332
01:01:30,301 --> 01:01:31,336
Wow.

333
01:01:32,781 --> 01:01:36,933
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection,
but I got you some options.

334
01:01:37,021 --> 01:01:39,489
First thing's first.

335
01:01:39,581 --> 01:01:41,139
Oh, you're kidding me.

336
01:01:50,981 --> 01:01:52,050
What?

337
01:01:52,621 --> 01:01:55,340
- No.
- They were the stretchiest pair they had.

338
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:56,695
I'll take my chances.

339
01:01:56,901 --> 01:01:59,290
<i>Rumours continue</i>
<i>to swirl about a violent clash</i>

340
01:01:59,381 --> 01:02:03,010
<i>between forces of the US military</i>
<i>and an unknown adversary</i>

341
01:02:03,101 --> 01:02:05,934
<i>on the campus of Culver University</i>
<i>earlier today.</i>

342
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:09,138
<i>Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson</i>
<i>witnessed some of the battle.</i>

343
01:02:09,221 --> 01:02:10,620
<i>It was so big.</i>

344
01:02:10,701 --> 01:02:13,454
<i>- It was like this huge, like, hulk!</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

345
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:16,453
<i>McGhee, who happens</i>
<i>to be a reporter for the campus paper,</i>

346
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:18,179

347
01:02:18,261 --> 01:02:19,899
<i>Further search for the mysterious "hulk"</i>

348
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:24,293
<i>was postponed by powerful thunderstorms</i>
<i>in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.</i>

349
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:34,334
Not too short back there.

350
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:36,776
I have done this before, you know.

351
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:54,489
I don't know how you've done this
on your own for all this time.

352
01:02:54,581 --> 01:02:56,412
With clippers, usually.

353
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:51,615
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- What? What?

354
01:03:51,701 --> 01:03:53,020
We can't do this.

355
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:55,092
- It's okay. I want to.
- No.

356
01:03:56,101 --> 01:03:57,136
No.

357
01:03:58,261 --> 01:03:59,455
I can't.

358
01:04:02,861 --> 01:04:04,772
I can't get too excited.

359
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:09,372
Not even a little excited?

360
01:04:11,941 --> 01:04:13,260
It's okay.

361
01:04:17,741 --> 01:04:19,538
Sir, it's Blonsky.

362
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,739
Has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family?

363
01:04:25,501 --> 01:04:27,093
Ask him yourself.

364
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:31,776
Sir?

365
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:54,975
- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier.
- Thank you, sir.

366
01:05:01,661 --> 01:05:02,855
How do you feel?

367
01:05:04,741 --> 01:05:07,050
Pissed off and ready for round three.

368
01:05:13,221 --> 01:05:17,055
Basically, we can't use any of this,
because they can track all of it.

369
01:05:17,141 --> 01:05:19,814
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?

370
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:23,733
- No. You can take your lip gloss.
- Thank you.

371
01:05:23,821 --> 01:05:26,619
- Well, I need my glasses.
- Well, you can take

372
01:05:26,701 --> 01:05:27,816
- your glasses and your watch, okay?
- Okay.

373
01:05:27,901 --> 01:05:31,371
We can use most of it. We just can't use
the credit cards, the ID or the phone.

374
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:33,656
- Don't even turn that on.
- Okay.

375
01:05:33,781 --> 01:05:35,817
And we'll take the cash, obviously.

376
01:05:35,901 --> 01:05:39,655
How will we get where we need to go
on $40 and no credit cards?

377
01:05:42,581 --> 01:05:45,334
Well, we could sell this.

378
01:05:45,421 --> 01:05:48,811
No. No, that's the only thing
you have left from her. No.

379
01:05:50,941 --> 01:05:53,535
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.

380
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:56,012
Federal is
already monitoring phones,

381
01:05:56,101 --> 01:05:58,251
plastic and Dr Ross's web accounts,

382
01:05:58,341 --> 01:06:00,491
and local PD have been placed on alert.

383
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:03,141
They'll pop up somewhere
and when they do, it comes straight to us.

384
01:06:03,221 --> 01:06:05,098
They're not gonna just pop up.

385
01:06:05,181 --> 01:06:08,093
He made it five years and got across borders
without making any mistakes.

386
01:06:08,181 --> 01:06:09,933
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.

387
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,013
<i>If he was trying to escape,</i>
<i>he'd be long gone.</i>

388
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,216
<i>He's not trying to escape this time.</i>

389
01:06:13,301 --> 01:06:15,690
<i>He's looking for help</i>
<i>and that's how we're gonna get him.</i>

390
01:06:15,781 --> 01:06:18,090
<i>We know what they're after and we know</i>
<i>he's been talking to somebody.</i>

391
01:06:18,181 --> 01:06:19,933
<i>You all have copies of the correspondence.</i>

392
01:06:20,421 --> 01:06:22,377
<i>The aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue</i>

393
01:06:22,461 --> 01:06:24,497
<i>have been added to the</i>
<i>SHIELD Operations Database.</i>

394
01:06:25,461 --> 01:06:27,099
<i>If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.</i>

395
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:30,417
<i>If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.</i>

396
01:06:30,501 --> 01:06:32,810
<i>And when he slips up, we'll be ready.</i>

397
01:07:13,941 --> 01:07:15,010
Hey.

398
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:17,930
Smile.

399
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:29,533
What is it like?

400
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:34,020
When it happens, what do you experience?

401
01:07:34,741 --> 01:07:37,209
Remember those experiments
we volunteered for at Harvard?

402
01:07:37,301 --> 01:07:39,292
Those induced hallucinations?

403
01:07:40,021 --> 01:07:43,297
It's a lot like that,
just a thousand times amplified.

404
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:48,815
It's like someone's poured
a litre of acid into my brain.

405
01:07:48,901 --> 01:07:53,531
- Do you remember anything?
- Just fragments. Images.

406
01:07:54,021 --> 01:07:57,058
There's too much noise.
I can never derive anything out of it.

407
01:07:57,141 --> 01:08:00,577
- But then it's still you inside it.
- No. No, it's not.

408
01:08:02,901 --> 01:08:06,894
I don't know.
In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.

409
01:08:07,621 --> 01:08:08,974
Maybe your mind is in there,

410
01:08:09,061 --> 01:08:11,575
it's just overcharged
and can't process what's happening.

411
01:08:11,661 --> 01:08:14,812
I don't want to control it.
I want to get rid of it.

412
01:08:27,501 --> 01:08:28,900
Are you ready?

413
01:08:28,981 --> 01:08:30,653
Let's even the playing field a little.

414
01:08:33,941 --> 01:08:35,169
Gentlemen.

415
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:42,496
Bruce, wake up.
There's something going on.

416
01:08:53,141 --> 01:08:56,053
We got to go. Walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast.

417
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:12,459
All right. Come.

418
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:29,853
It is a long way uptown.
I think the subway's probably quickest.

419
01:09:30,701 --> 01:09:32,532
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,

420
01:09:32,621 --> 01:09:34,976
with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city in the world?

421
01:09:35,061 --> 01:09:37,621
Right. Let's get a cab.

422
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:41,740
Come on, now! Let's go!
You're too slow! You drive like a woman!

423
01:09:46,461 --> 01:09:47,974
- Very nice. You see her?
- Oh, my.

424
01:09:48,061 --> 01:09:51,053
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!

425
01:09:51,141 --> 01:09:53,097
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

426
01:09:56,261 --> 01:09:58,821
Are you out of your mind?

427
01:09:58,901 --> 01:10:00,175
- What is wrong with you?
- What's the matter, baby?

428
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:01,899
You don't like a good ride?

429
01:10:03,661 --> 01:10:04,855
Asshole!

430
01:10:07,861 --> 01:10:10,250
You know, I know a few
techniques could help you

431
01:10:10,341 --> 01:10:14,380
- manage that anger very effectively.
- You zip it. We're walking.

432
01:10:14,781 --> 01:10:15,770
Okay.

433
01:10:23,021 --> 01:10:24,898
Excuse me. Dr Sterns?

434
01:10:24,981 --> 01:10:27,415
- Yes.
- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.

435
01:10:28,301 --> 01:10:30,212
Oh! Dr Ross!

436
01:10:30,301 --> 01:10:33,099
- I have someone who'd like to meet you.
- Okay.

437
01:10:35,501 --> 01:10:36,900
It's Mr Blue, isn't it?

438
01:10:38,661 --> 01:10:39,980
Mr Green?

439
01:10:42,141 --> 01:10:45,656
I got to tell you,
I've been wondering if you were even real.

440
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,413
And if you were, what would it look like?

441
01:10:47,501 --> 01:10:51,972
A person with that much
power lurking in him.

442
01:10:52,061 --> 01:10:53,619
Nothing could have surprised me more

443
01:10:53,701 --> 01:10:56,454
than this unassuming man
shaking my hand.

444
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:59,101
But, look. We're not strolling
into the park for a picnic, here.

445
01:10:59,181 --> 01:11:00,773
Even if everything goes perfectly,

446
01:11:00,861 --> 01:11:04,536
if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right,

447
01:11:05,501 --> 01:11:07,332
is that going to be a lasting cure

448
01:11:07,421 --> 01:11:10,618
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flare-up?

449
01:11:12,821 --> 01:11:14,220
I don't know.

450
01:11:14,941 --> 01:11:19,457
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer

451
01:11:20,381 --> 01:11:25,057
we're dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity.

452
01:11:25,141 --> 01:11:29,498
- You mean it could kill him.
- Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.

453
01:11:31,141 --> 01:11:33,177
You should know that there's
a flip side to this, too.

454
01:11:33,261 --> 01:11:36,651
If we miss on the low side,
if we induce me and it fails,

455
01:11:36,741 --> 01:11:39,096
this will be very dangerous for you.

456
01:11:40,821 --> 01:11:44,700
Look. I've always been
more curious than cautious,

457
01:11:44,781 --> 01:11:48,854
and that's served me pretty well.
So, are we going to do this?

458
01:12:41,661 --> 01:12:43,219
How you feeling, man?

459
01:12:44,901 --> 01:12:46,414
Like a monster.

460
01:13:05,501 --> 01:13:07,173
Okay. On the table.

461
01:13:07,901 --> 01:13:13,055
These will protect you from yourself
if you have a strong reaction.

462
01:13:14,261 --> 01:13:17,094
You can tell me later
if you thought it was strong.

463
01:13:21,141 --> 01:13:25,373
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.

464
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:30,890
Okay...

465
01:13:31,461 --> 01:13:32,860
You, you, you.

466
01:13:34,421 --> 01:13:37,731
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.

467
01:13:40,301 --> 01:13:41,734
We have begun.

468
01:13:43,501 --> 01:13:46,413
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote
with your blood.

469
01:13:46,501 --> 01:13:50,779
Except the antidote will only take hold
once we've achieved a full reaction.

470
01:13:50,861 --> 01:13:51,976
Just relax.

471
01:13:52,701 --> 01:13:55,898
Okay. We are comprehensive.

472
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:00,380
Here you go.

473
01:14:09,981 --> 01:14:11,892
All right. We set to pop?

474
01:14:14,301 --> 01:14:16,371
I'd take your hands off him.

475
01:14:35,381 --> 01:14:37,337
Oh, my God!

476
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,817
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!

477
01:15:03,181 --> 01:15:05,649
- Now. Okay, now!
- Wait.

478
01:15:05,741 --> 01:15:08,209
Now, do it! Do it!

479
01:15:15,421 --> 01:15:17,810
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.

480
01:15:17,901 --> 01:15:22,213
Stay with me. The antidote, now!
Sterns, do it now!

481
01:15:23,621 --> 01:15:27,455
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.
Please, look in my eyes.

482
01:15:28,621 --> 01:15:30,930
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

483
01:15:49,741 --> 01:15:50,890
Bruce.

484
01:15:50,981 --> 01:15:52,300
Oh, my God.

485
01:16:03,221 --> 01:16:06,099
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?

486
01:16:09,981 --> 01:16:11,096
Bruce?

487
01:16:19,581 --> 01:16:22,812
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.

488
01:16:26,101 --> 01:16:27,420
You did it.

489
01:16:27,581 --> 01:16:30,141
He's fine. This is fantastic.

490
01:16:30,221 --> 01:16:31,495
It's over.

491
01:16:32,381 --> 01:16:33,416
Hi.

492
01:16:33,741 --> 01:16:34,810
Hi.

493
01:16:42,821 --> 01:16:48,532
That was the most extraordinary thing
I have seen in my entire life!

494
01:16:48,621 --> 01:16:50,134
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.

495
01:16:50,221 --> 01:16:52,496
We need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there.

496
01:16:52,581 --> 01:16:56,210
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse
came from the amygdala.

497
01:16:56,301 --> 01:16:57,973
- I think Dr Ross's primer...
- Are you okay?

498
01:16:58,061 --> 01:17:01,178
...lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily, and then it abates.

499
01:17:01,261 --> 01:17:03,934
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago!

500
01:17:04,021 --> 01:17:06,615
Now, maybe we've neutralised
those cells permanently,

501
01:17:06,701 --> 01:17:08,532
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

502
01:17:08,621 --> 01:17:10,851
I'm inclined to think the latter,
but it's hard to know

503
01:17:10,941 --> 01:17:12,659
because none of our
test subjects ever survived.

504
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:14,299
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer!
- Wait, wait.

505
01:17:14,381 --> 01:17:15,734
- Wait, what did you just say?
- They weren't getting

506
01:17:15,821 --> 01:17:18,255
- the myostatin primer...
- No, no, no. Test subjects?

507
01:17:19,261 --> 01:17:20,933
What test subjects?

508
01:17:21,621 --> 01:17:22,610
Come with me.

509
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:42,775
- What's the activity level?
- Snipers are covering Alpha sector.

510
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:44,934
<i>We started on rats and mice,</i>

511
01:17:45,021 --> 01:17:47,489
<i>but it just completely fried them,</i>
<i>so we had to go bigger.</i>

512
01:17:47,741 --> 01:17:50,733
And we still don't know which is more toxic,
the gamma or your blood.

513
01:17:50,821 --> 01:17:54,416
- What do you mean, my blood?
- Bruce, this is all you.

514
01:17:55,221 --> 01:17:59,055
You didn't send me much to work with,
so I had to concentrate it and make more.

515
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:02,258
With a little more trial and error,
there's no end to what we can do!

516
01:18:02,341 --> 01:18:05,890
This is potentially Olympian!

517
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:09,337
This gamma technology
has limitless applications.

518
01:18:09,421 --> 01:18:11,377
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

519
01:18:11,461 --> 01:18:14,453
We will make humans
impervious to disease!

520
01:18:28,061 --> 01:18:29,653
No, no, we've got to destroy it.

521
01:18:30,101 --> 01:18:31,898
- Wait, what?
- All of it.

522
01:18:32,021 --> 01:18:33,340
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.

523
01:18:33,421 --> 01:18:35,571
- Is this the whole supply?
- What...

524
01:18:35,661 --> 01:18:37,140
We could get the Nobel for this!

525
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:39,337
You don't understand
the power of this thing.

526
01:18:39,421 --> 01:18:41,935
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.

527
01:18:42,581 --> 01:18:44,014
At your discretion, shooter.

528
01:18:44,101 --> 01:18:45,500
<i>three of us!</i>
<i>This is Promethean fire!</i>

529
01:18:45,581 --> 01:18:46,570
<i>It's just...</i>

530
01:18:46,661 --> 01:18:47,855
<i>No shot.</i>

531
01:18:51,061 --> 01:18:52,779
Blonsky's going in.

532
01:18:54,901 --> 01:18:57,654
<i>Blonsky, stand down.</i>
<i>My daughter's in there!</i>

533
01:19:00,141 --> 01:19:01,176
We have the antidote now.

534
01:19:01,261 --> 01:19:03,980
They don't want the antidote!
They want to make it a weapon!

535
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:12,492
And if we let it go, we will never get it back.

536
01:19:12,701 --> 01:19:14,657
<i>You don't know how powerful this thing is.</i>

537
01:19:14,741 --> 01:19:16,652
I hate the government
just as much as anyone,

538
01:19:16,741 --> 01:19:18,459
but you're being a little paranoid,
don't you think?

539
01:19:25,941 --> 01:19:27,374
Bruce! Bruce!

540
01:19:29,021 --> 01:19:30,215
Get out.

541
01:19:33,341 --> 01:19:35,980
Where is it? Come on, where is it?

542
01:19:40,021 --> 01:19:41,613
Show him to me.

543
01:19:43,061 --> 01:19:44,289
Blonsky!

544
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:53,456
Miss!

545
01:19:54,901 --> 01:19:56,220
Take this.

546
01:19:59,701 --> 01:20:04,092
If you took it from me, I'm gonna
put you in a hole for the rest of your life.

547
01:20:09,621 --> 01:20:10,736
Betty.

548
01:20:12,621 --> 01:20:15,499
I will never forgive what you've done to him.

549
01:20:15,581 --> 01:20:16,855
He's a fugitive.

550
01:20:16,941 --> 01:20:18,818
You made him a fugitive

551
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:22,257
to cover your failures
and to protect your career.

552
01:20:23,021 --> 01:20:25,740
Don't ever speak to me
as your daughter again.

553
01:20:27,901 --> 01:20:31,257
It's only because you're my daughter
that you're not in handcuffs, too.

554
01:20:35,981 --> 01:20:37,130
Are you telling me
you can make more like him?

555
01:20:37,221 --> 01:20:41,772
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces,
but it's not like I can put together

556
01:20:41,861 --> 01:20:45,058
the same Humpty Dumpty,
if that's what you're asking.

557
01:20:45,141 --> 01:20:48,850
He was a freak accident!
The goal is to do it better!

558
01:20:48,941 --> 01:20:50,772
So Banner's the only...

559
01:20:54,421 --> 01:20:58,653
- She's an annoying bitch.
- Why are you always hitting people?

560
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:05,850
Now what possibly could I have done
to deserve such aggression?

561
01:21:05,941 --> 01:21:08,535
It's not what you've done.
It's what you're gonna do.

562
01:21:09,461 --> 01:21:11,816
I want what you got out of Banner.
I want that.

563
01:21:15,181 --> 01:21:19,060
You look like you've got a little
something in you already, don't you?

564
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:23,811
I want more.
You've seen what he becomes, right?

565
01:21:24,501 --> 01:21:25,650
I have.

566
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:28,060
And it's beautiful.

567
01:21:28,861 --> 01:21:30,055
Godlike.

568
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:31,899
Well, I want that.

569
01:21:33,981 --> 01:21:35,972
I need that. Make me that.

570
01:21:36,821 --> 01:21:39,699
I don't know what you've got
inside you already.

571
01:21:39,781 --> 01:21:41,294
The mix could be

572
01:21:41,901 --> 01:21:43,380
an abomination.

573
01:21:46,901 --> 01:21:49,620
I didn't say I was unwilling.

574
01:21:50,141 --> 01:21:53,736
I just need informed consent.

575
01:21:56,141 --> 01:21:57,859
And you've given it.

576
01:22:37,301 --> 01:22:41,374
This is what I was trying to explain.

577
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:46,171
I don't know what you've been
ladling into yourself.

578
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,252
But clearly it worked.

579
01:22:48,341 --> 01:22:51,811
Let's assume you don't understand
a word I'm saying,

580
01:22:51,901 --> 01:22:56,531
but if you'll just get back on the table,

581
01:22:56,621 --> 01:22:59,010
I can fix this.

582
01:23:13,301 --> 01:23:14,939
Shoot it!
- Hey!

583
01:23:15,701 --> 01:23:16,736
No!

584
01:23:25,941 --> 01:23:27,897
Delta 4 to Leader.

585
01:23:27,981 --> 01:23:29,653
They took out two of our guys,
two of our guys!

586
01:23:29,741 --> 01:23:32,335
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!

587
01:23:35,101 --> 01:23:37,296
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

588
01:23:44,941 --> 01:23:46,454
It's over there!

589
01:23:48,181 --> 01:23:49,296
Drop them!

590
01:23:49,381 --> 01:23:51,531
What is that thing?
- Shoot it!

591
01:24:00,621 --> 01:24:04,250
Okay. All right! You... You, drive!
Let's go! Move, move!

592
01:24:04,341 --> 01:24:05,615
Delta 4 to Leader!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

593
01:24:05,701 --> 01:24:07,532
Something big
just went off down here!

594
01:24:08,061 --> 01:24:10,097
General, you should hear this!

595
01:24:10,181 --> 01:24:12,979
The Hulk is in the street!
I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!

596
01:24:15,461 --> 01:24:17,452
That's impossible.
You get a hold of yourself, young man.

597
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:19,372
You get it together. What is your position?

598
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:22,613
121st Street, heading north on Broadway!

599
01:24:22,701 --> 01:24:24,180
Turn us around.

600
01:24:30,861 --> 01:24:33,933
We're going back. Why are we going back?

601
01:24:34,021 --> 01:24:35,579
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!

602
01:24:35,981 --> 01:24:37,209
Yes, sir!

603
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:40,972
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

604
01:24:41,301 --> 01:24:42,859
Go, go, go!

605
01:25:05,461 --> 01:25:06,655
No!

606
01:25:22,261 --> 01:25:23,535
One of yours?

607
01:25:23,781 --> 01:25:26,739
Oh, my God. What have you done?

608
01:25:28,981 --> 01:25:30,733
Fire at him, fire at him!

609
01:25:34,901 --> 01:25:36,892
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?

610
01:25:37,301 --> 01:25:38,495
Come on!

611
01:25:41,861 --> 01:25:42,976
Sweet.

612
01:25:45,781 --> 01:25:46,930
Booyah!

613
01:26:04,221 --> 01:26:05,495
Get out of there, soldier!

614
01:26:08,701 --> 01:26:10,259
Stacy!

615
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:41,492
Give me a real fight!

616
01:26:49,261 --> 01:26:50,376
Sir?

617
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:54,010
Sir?

618
01:26:55,501 --> 01:26:58,379
Tell them to bring everything they've got
and head for Harlem.

619
01:27:01,621 --> 01:27:04,931
It has to be me.
You have to take me back there.

620
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:06,740
What are you saying?

621
01:27:06,901 --> 01:27:08,129
You think you can control it?

622
01:27:08,221 --> 01:27:11,213
No, no, not control it,
but, I don't know, maybe aim it.

623
01:27:11,301 --> 01:27:12,700
And what if you can't?

624
01:27:14,181 --> 01:27:15,853
We made this thing.

625
01:27:16,341 --> 01:27:17,615
All of us.

626
01:27:18,581 --> 01:27:19,730
Please.

627
01:27:24,501 --> 01:27:26,890
- Land us near it.
- No, no. No, keep us high.

628
01:27:28,421 --> 01:27:29,695
Open the back door.

629
01:27:35,221 --> 01:27:39,897
Bruce! Bruce, stop!
Stop! What are you doing?

630
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:43,530
Think about this!
You don't even know if you'll change!

631
01:27:45,461 --> 01:27:48,533
You don't have to do this!
Please, this is insane!

632
01:27:48,621 --> 01:27:50,293
Betty, I've got to try.

633
01:27:52,381 --> 01:27:53,655
I'm sorry.

634
01:28:15,381 --> 01:28:16,973
Oh, shit!

635
01:28:20,821 --> 01:28:23,540
- Get her in here!
- Come on, miss.

636
01:28:40,261 --> 01:28:42,217
There. Betty!

637
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:01,980
Hulk!

638
01:29:06,581 --> 01:29:08,219
Yeah!

639
01:29:50,661 --> 01:29:51,855
Come on!

640
01:30:22,781 --> 01:30:24,658
Is that all you've got?

641
01:30:37,821 --> 01:30:40,494
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!

642
01:30:40,581 --> 01:30:41,775
Which one?

643
01:30:41,861 --> 01:30:44,091
Help the green one, damn it!
Which one do you think?

644
01:30:44,181 --> 01:30:45,933
Cut the other one in half!

645
01:30:48,501 --> 01:30:49,616
Ross!

646
01:31:13,381 --> 01:31:15,053
Keep it on him!

647
01:31:42,101 --> 01:31:44,979
Look, I got to put it down!
- Hang on!

648
01:32:49,461 --> 01:32:50,530
Dad?

649
01:32:53,061 --> 01:32:55,450
Are you hurt? Let me help you.

650
01:33:02,901 --> 01:33:04,698
I'm all right. Just find a way out.

651
01:33:50,581 --> 01:33:56,975
You don't deserve this power!
Now watch her die!

652
01:34:45,621 --> 01:34:47,213
Look out!

653
01:35:16,781 --> 01:35:17,975
General?

654
01:35:23,981 --> 01:35:26,449
Any last words?

655
01:35:29,141 --> 01:35:32,417
Hulk smash!

656
01:36:18,021 --> 01:36:19,534
Stop!

657
01:37:36,981 --> 01:37:38,255
It's okay.

658
01:37:47,981 --> 01:37:49,573
Betty.

659
01:40:11,541 --> 01:40:12,815
Reload.

660
01:40:20,061 --> 01:40:21,210
Reload.

661
01:40:36,581 --> 01:40:39,618
The smell of stale beer and defeat.

662
01:40:39,701 --> 01:40:41,373
You know, I hate to say,
"I told you so," General,

663
01:40:41,461 --> 01:40:45,693
but that Super Soldier programme
was put on ice for a reason.

664
01:40:45,781 --> 01:40:48,534
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.

665
01:40:48,741 --> 01:40:50,936
- Stark.
- General.

666
01:40:53,181 --> 01:40:55,570
You always wear such nice suits.

667
01:40:56,501 --> 01:40:57,775
Touché.

668
01:40:58,661 --> 01:41:02,210
- I hear you have an unusual problem.
- You should talk.

669
01:41:02,301 --> 01:41:03,734
You should listen.

670
01:41:06,301 --> 01:41:09,007
What if I told you we were
putting a team together?

671
01:41:09,741 --> 01:41:11,254
Who's "we"?
