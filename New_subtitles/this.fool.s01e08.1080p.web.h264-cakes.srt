1
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,673
Well, it's kinda hard for me to say.

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,302
But since I got out,
there's this place I've been going to.

3
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:14,431
There's a minister there, Dr. Payne.

4
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:19,603
He's all about this shit called,
um, personal accountability.

5
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,149
And part of that is facing up to people
that you've hurt in the past,

6
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,027
making amends and shit.

7
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,696
So I came here today to,

8
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,533
to tell you that, uh,

9
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,287
that I deeply regret
shooting you in the ass.

10
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,601
You know, it was funny to me at the time,

11
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:45,045
but now I realize that
even though it was super funny,

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,673
it was also wrong.

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,860
So I just wanna say to you...

14
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,070
that I'm sorry...

15
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,720
You didn't shoot me in my ass.

16
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,267
It was the devil that shot me in my ass.

17
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,478
All that crazy shit
we did back in the day,

18
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,647
the devil made us do it.

19
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,084
Nah, homey, I'm pretty sure it was me.

20
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,173
'Cause I actually remember
I was gonna shoot you in the leg,

21
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,237
but then at the last second I thought,
"Ah, fuck it.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,553
It'll be funnier
if I shoot him in the ass."

23
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,817
And who do you think told you
the ass would be funnier?

24
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,515
The devil, bro.

25
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,583
That dude's got a sick sense of humor.

26
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:24,793
I was just like you.

27
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,939
Weighed down by
all the evil shit that I did.

28
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,692
But once I realized
that it was the devil's fault,

29
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,360
poof,

30
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,844
all that guilt washed away.

31
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,614
So I appreciate you coming here today.

32
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,348
But you don't owe me an apology.

33
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,559
The devil did us both dirty.

34
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,229
Hey, dawg, you sure
about this devil shit?

35
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,858
The devil is all around us, my dude.

36
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,985
And he's making you do shit.

37
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,199
Spread the gospel.

38
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,584
Ah.

39
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,764
This bed is so tiny.

40
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,452
A grown-ass man should not be sleeping

41
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,062
in the same place
where he got his first boner.

42
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,708
Nope. I got my first boner at church.

43
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,332
I had a crush on La Virgen de Guadalupe.

44
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,905
All covered up.
What's under those robes, Lupe?

45
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,074
Fuckin' nasty, dude.

46
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,763
We should get our own place.

47
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,832
With a big-ass bed.

48
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,794
And a giant toilet
for your huge-ass dumper.

49
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,629
Heh... heh.

50
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,568
Julio, I don't even know

51
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,427
the last time I saw your hair messy.

52
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,071
What are you trying to hide?

53
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,698
- Let it go.
- No, no, I'll show you right now.

54
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,116
- Hey.
- ANA and MAGGIE: Oh.

55
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,576
Oh!

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,244
Damn, okay. Ninja Warrior over here.

57
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,539
I've seen his hair messy
plenty of times.

58
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,273
Miren. I got pics.

59
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,029
It sticks straight up.

60
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,882
Oh, that reminds me,

61
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:03,285
Aiden, there's something you want to
ask your tío Julio and tía Maggie.

62
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,872
Will you be
my nino and Nina for my first communion?

63
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,750
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

64
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,686
Of course, mijo.

65
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,212
Ye-yeah, mijo, we'd love it.

66
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,940
Good luck getting rid of me now, Julio.

67
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,133
Hey.

68
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,927
Jesus! You fuckin' creeper.

69
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,470
Hey, do you really think
it's a good idea

70
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,846
to have Maggie as the godmother?

71
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,972
Why wouldn't it be?

72
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,600
Well, I think Ana's feelings are hurt
because you didn't ask her.

73
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,894
You know, she's family. Maggie's not.

74
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,646
Uh, not interested. God isn't real.

75
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,506
When you die you go into the ground.
End of story.

76
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,192
See?

77
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,654
Well, the other thing is me and Maggie
just got back together again.

78
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,113
You know our history.

79
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,115
Who knows how long
we're gonna be together this time?

80
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,368
And then Aiden could lose his Nina.

81
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,619
Poor little guy.

82
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,372
- Shut up, Julio.
- No one gives a shit about godparents.

83
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,082
Do you remember who your padrinos are?

84
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,834
Socorro and Vicente. Great people.

85
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:16,960
I'm actually gonna go see them later.

86
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,820
Oh, that's weird because they're dead
and those aren't their names.

87
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,589
Okay, so what are their names?

88
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,490
I'll go visit their graves
and pay my respects.

89
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,469
I don't even believe
in any of this Catholic shit anyways.

90
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,887
I'm just trying to get this over with.

91
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,454
- Wait, you don't believe?
- Ew, no.

92
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,933
Just doing it for my mom and abuelita.

93
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,168
- Wait. Do you believe?
- Of course not.

94
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,087
Why do you care if Maggie's madrina?

95
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,608
- Okay. Fine, then. Yeah. Great choice.
- I know.

96
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,985
I love it.

97
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,153
Maggie's the madrina.

98
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,303
You dumb-ass.

99
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,959
Oh, jeez. Jeez! Oh, jeez!

100
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,294
Oh, no, no, no.

101
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:00,485
No, no.

102
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,196
Aiden.

103
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,164
So I guess you're pretty excited to have
your tía Maggie as your godmother, huh?

104
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,558
Yeah.

105
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,959
The thing is,
I don't think you should be.

106
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,147
Your tía Maggie, she's bad.

107
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,399
She's mean to your tío Julio.

108
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,026
What does she do to you?

109
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,760
She calls me nasty names.

110
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,304
Like Pepperoni Tits.

111
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,642
- That's funny.
- Well, that's not all she does.

112
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:33,852
She also hits me.

113
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,705
She does?

114
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,315
Yeah, she hits me really hard,
and it hurts a lot.

115
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:42,277
And if you let her be your godmother,
she might start hitting you too.

116
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,757
Also, she worships the devil.

117
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,383
Does she drink your blood?

118
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,117
I've lost so much blood, mijo.

119
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,203
Is that why you look so old?

120
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,891
Yes.

121
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:55,975
Don't cry, tío.

122
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,417
- I'm not crying.
- Oh.

123
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,938
Kinda looked like
you were going to cry for a second.

124
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,439
- No, I wasn't.
- Oh.

125
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,340
Okay, kids, it's time to go.

126
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,903
Okay, just tell your mom
you don't want your tía Maggie

127
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,238
to be your madrina, okay?

128
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,013
- Okay.
- I'll protect you. Give me a hug.

129
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,266
Get outta here. Go, go.

130
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,230
We are all animals, my lady.

131
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,775
Most are too afraid to see it.

132
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,861
Hey.

133
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,047
How are the amends going?

134
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,507
I know that shit can be hard.

135
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,092
No, I'm not doing that shit anymore.

136
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,760
Turns out the devil made me
do all that stuff,

137
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,387
so it wasn't even my fault.

138
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,764
What are you talking about,
the devil made you do it?

139
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,016
Julio, you fucking pendejo!

140
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,436
Did you tell Aiden that Maggie hits you
and worships the devil?

141
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,647
- What?
- It was a joke.

142
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,232
That fuckin' snitch
wasn't supposed to tell.

143
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,359
And also, I was just giving you an out.

144
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,611
You know, just in case
you don't wanna be Aiden's godmother.

145
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,864
I didn't ask for an out.

146
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,323
What the fuck is wrong with you?

147
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,201
- You know what, Julio?
- You're fired as padrino.

148
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,452
Good. It's what you get.

149
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,036
Hey, Luis, you wanna be Aiden's nino?

150
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,648
Oh, wow. It's a lot of responsibility.

151
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,877
You know, protecting him
from the devil and all.

152
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,795
Just wonder
if I'm up for the task at hand.

153
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,299
- Just fuckin' say yes, goddamn it.
- Alright. Yes, I'll do it.

154
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,606
Sabes que? I could get him
a piñata for the after-party.

155
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:15,305
People don't buy piñatas
for a First Communion, dumb-ass.

156
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,848
You clearly don't know
what you're talking about.

157
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,016
You just got fired, bitch.

158
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,059
Why the fuck
would you tell Aiden I hit you?

159
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,084
It was a joke!

160
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,380
- Hey, I like your necklace.
- Oh, thank you.

161
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,965
Um, you look good too. Is this a new tie?

162
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,324
Nah, I jacked it from Julio.

163
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,386
It looks like I'd be
the manager of Circuit City.

164
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,537
Okay.

165
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,139
Ay, see you in there.

166
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,248
Damn.

167
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,416
So you're a padrino now?

168
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,353
Don't seem right to me.

169
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,938
Oh, shit, Johnny?

170
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,255
It's been a long-ass time.

171
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,632
The last time I saw you, you were skinny.

172
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,860
What happened, homey,
you got a set of twins in there or what?

173
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,094
Hey, fuck you, perro!

174
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,490
You got something you wanna say to me?

175
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:15,824
Like what?

176
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:18,350
Like a fuckin' apology
for doing me dirty back in the day.

177
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,662
Oh! Hey, you know what?

178
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:23,188
I recently found out
it wasn't me that did you dirty.

179
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,733
It was the devil.

180
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,419
I'm mad he did you dirty too.

181
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,046
That's some bullshit.

182
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,573
You're still a fuckin' asshole.

183
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,908
With a godfather like you,

184
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,412
I'm worried about
little dude Aiden over there.

185
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,415
Cabrón.

186
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,768
¿Sabes que?

187
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,295
I'm gonna be the best godfather
that little fool's ever had.

188
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,150
Aiden, where the fuck you going?

189
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,026
I-I gotta do my first confession.

190
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,945
Alright, then, I got you, mijo.

191
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,220
I'm your fuckin' nino.

192
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:57,890
Let's go.

193
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,604
Uh, hi, father,
this is my first confession.

194
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,541
Nothing to be nervous about, my son.

195
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,108
Just speak your sins.

196
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:10,819
Alleged sins, homey.

197
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,592
The sacrament of penance
is one that must be taken privately.

198
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,327
- It's cool, father, alright?
- I'm the nino.

199
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,870
Go ahead, mijo.

200
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,391
I make fart noises
with my armpit during school

201
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,268
when the teacher isn't looking.

202
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,145
I accused my brother Michael of farting

203
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,397
when it was actually me who farted.

204
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,840
And I farted on his face
while he was sleeping.

205
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:36,571
Well, my son,
farting itself is not a sin,

206
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,073
but doing so with malice is.

207
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,658
Nah, nah, nah, hold up, dawg.

208
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,476
The devil made him do those farts.

209
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:47,248
God gave us free will so that we may
choose between right and wrong.

210
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,875
Damn, father!

211
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,752
You're just gonna let
the devil off the hook like that?

212
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,213
And furthermore,
you're gonna victim blame a little boy

213
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:54,672
who was tricked by a demon?

214
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,050
The devil made him
throw those pedos. Satan as!

215
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,076
Let's forget about the devil right now.

216
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,078
Wish I could.

217
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,641
Tell me more about your sins, my son.

218
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,501
I also collect gum
from underneath the tables

219
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,771
and I put them in my brother's sandwiches.

220
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,523
Hey, homey, don't tell
this fool anything else.

221
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:12,548
Alright? We're done here.

222
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,400
You know what, Mr. Priest?

223
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,735
You got a lot to learn about the devil.

224
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,386
Here, read this pamphlet I just got.

225
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,513
Right here.

226
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,618
- Wait. You're gonna break it.
- What are you trying to do?

227
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,078
It doesn't fit.

228
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,704
Nah, nah, it'll get through there.

229
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,039
You could give it to me outside.

230
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,374
- Get it, get it, father.
- It won't fit.

231
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,042
Alright, well, just come around
and get it when we leave.

232
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,386
- Come on, let's go, mijo.
- No, you can't leave that here.

233
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:37,281
So you're saying
I'm possessed by the devil?

234
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,384
Yes.

235
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,994
But I'm your nino, okay?
I'm here to protect you from the devil.

236
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,597
And I'm not gonna let some ruco
who's never been laid

237
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,332
try to make you feel guilty
about something the devil made you do.

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,229
So whenever I do
something bad it's not my fault,

239
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,522
the devil made me do it?

240
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,065
You got it.

241
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,067
Damn, you know what?
You're super smart, mijo.

242
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,443
Just like me.

243
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,154
You know, they even made me
repeat the third grade

244
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,658
so I could help teach the other kids.

245
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,556
Because that's how smart I was.

246
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,673
You sure you wanna
sit next to your abuser?

247
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,800
Come on! Are you really still mad at me?

248
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,576
- It's been a week already.
- Shh.

249
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,138
Amen.

250
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,531
Maggie, I said I was sorry.

251
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,273
What do you want me to do,
some Hail Marys or something?

252
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,474
Why do you even care about
being godmother so much?

253
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,267
You don't even believe
in this Catholic stuff.

254
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,417
So? Neither do you.

255
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,754
Both of you shut up!

256
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,345
Fine. I'm sorry, Mags, you're fired.

257
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,950
Ana, you're the godmother now.

258
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,725
I don't wanna be the godmother.

259
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,579
You know I don't believe in this stuff.

260
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,457
- Well, today you do.
- So shut up and believe in God.

261
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,667
Do it for Mom.

262
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:36,709
Shh.

263
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,337
Hey. Congratulations.

264
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,989
...palabra de Dios.

265
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:51,874
Amen.

266
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,001
Ay!

267
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,879
The devil made me do it.

268
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,779
Congratulations, mijo.

269
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,448
You made the devil cry like a bitch
when you ate la hostia.

270
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,724
That's what's up.

271
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,518
Aiden!

272
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,353
What is this?

273
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,999
- It's not my fault!
- The devil made me do it.

274
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,542
He makes me do crazy things.

275
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,568
Like fart and steal.

276
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,629
No, no, no. He's right.

277
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,381
You know, the devil probably got pissed

278
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,758
'cause God's winning Aiden over,
so that red fool, you know...

279
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,510
Shut the hell up about the devil.

280
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,470
You've been talking
about that crap all week

281
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,055
and now you've put it
in my son's head too?

282
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,432
You're fired as padrino.

283
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,832
Oh, what?

284
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,836
No!

285
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,823
Son... can I get one of those?

286
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,682
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

287
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,397
Hey, father, can I ask you
for some fatherly advice?

288
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,941
Yes, my son.

289
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,461
Oh, you know,
I think I'm just confused 'cause,

290
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,129
you know, I missed
a lot of church growing up

291
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,673
'cause I was out there fuckin' around.

292
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,717
Your boy put it down on these streets.

293
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,981
But recently somebody told me that it was
the devil that made me do all that shit.

294
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:12,764
But then you were in there

295
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,934
saying how God gives us the power
to make our own choices.

296
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,018
So now I'm thinking that, like...

297
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:20,188
All you need to do
is confess your sins to God

298
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,898
and you shall be forgiven.

299
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,566
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

300
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,361
You're telling me all I gotta do is
confess to God and everything's cool?

301
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:29,179
Confession to God
is the path to redemption.

302
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,951
Yeah, this Catholic shit is dope!

303
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,619
No wonder why people
give you all their money.

304
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,603
Hey, hey, hey. ¿Sabes que, padre?

305
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,856
Can we do a confession like right now?

306
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,837
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

307
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,779
- Oh, shit.
- You're forgiven.

308
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,470
Hey. Gracias, padre.

309
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:53,495
Gracias.

310
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,914
Wait. Can I get a light?

311
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,458
Can I get a light?

312
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,138
- Hola.
- Hola.

313
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,557
I'm Julio's boss.

314
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,910
Soy, uh...

315
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,477
Soy el jefe de Julio.

316
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,831
- Ah! El jefe de Julio.
- Julio's boss.

317
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,356
Sí, sí, sí.

318
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,074
Sí.

319
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,638
Hey, Maggie, I talked to Rocio

320
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,223
and she says you're back
on madrina status

321
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,309
as long as I don't talk to her
for the rest of the day.

322
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,602
I don't care.

323
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,866
You threw me under the bus
in front of your whole family.

324
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,149
Okay, look, sorry for blowing up
your shit in front of my mom.

325
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,359
It's just you're always hanging around
with my fuckin' family.

326
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,529
That shit stresses me out.
We just got back together.

327
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:55,116
Dude, maybe I wouldn't
hang with your family so much

328
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,660
if you didn't still live at home
like a fucking scrub.

329
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,997
Until you cut the fucking umbilical cord
and move out of your mom's house,

330
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,773
that's just how it's gonna be.

331
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,902
- Alright, fuck it.
- Let's move in together.

332
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,782
No mames. Fuck off.

333
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:21,726
Why are you mad?

334
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,186
I'm mad because you're full of shit.

335
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,604
You always say whatever
you have to say in the moment

336
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:26,708
to get out of trouble,
and then you never back it up.

337
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,234
Hey, I'm serious this time.

338
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:30,985
I wanna move in with you,

339
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,904
but we're not moving into your place.

340
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,239
We're starting new.

341
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:38,934
Let's get our own place
with a big-ass bed and a huge-ass toilet.

342
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,705
You better not be
fucking with me this time.

343
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,814
Swear to God.

344
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,385
I can't believe
you told Aiden I hit you.

345
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,594
You do hit me.

346
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,054
And how many times have I told you

347
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,038
to keep your little whore mouth
shut about it?

348
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,916
No. Fuck that.

349
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,359
She's a virgin.
She needs to watch and learn.

350
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,528
Cállate, cochino.

351
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,033
Hey, Johnny.

352
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,473
I wanted to tell you
that shit that I did to you,

353
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,832
it actually was my fault.

354
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,102
But you know what, my boy?

355
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,420
Luckily, I confessed to God,
and that fool forgave me.

356
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:51,274
So now you and I are all good.
Come on, let's take a shot.

357
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:54,384
Dawg! You can't even say you're sorry.

358
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,804
You're pathetic.

359
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,866
Hey, hey, hey. You know what?

360
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,701
You're kinda being
a dick right now, Johnny.

361
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,852
You need to take this shot with me
and chill out.

362
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,813
Luis!

363
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,233
Fuck you, dawg!

364
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,642
Hey, Luis.

365
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,247
Rocio made me godfather.

366
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:48,981
I'm a nino now.

367
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,859
- Which one is Aiden again?
- Good for you.

368
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:53,777
Everyone here thinks I'm an asshole.

369
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,405
It's like, man, get over that shit.

370
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,218
So the amends aren't going well?

371
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:01,678
No, they're not.

372
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,429
You know, this one fool told me that

373
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,289
the devil made me do
all the shit that I did.

374
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,684
Turns out the devil ain't real.

375
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,168
Oh, no, the devil is real.

376
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,712
He's just up here.

377
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:15,591
And God is somewhere right over here.

378
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,820
All that stuff is in your head.

379
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,614
I mean, it can feel like there's
a battle between good and evil,

380
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,740
but really, it's just you.

381
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:23,807
It's just your mind.

382
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,103
You make choices,
you often live to regret those choices.

383
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,039
That's why you gotta say you're sorry.

384
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,667
And that's not gonna undo what you did.

385
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:35,086
But honestly, you're gonna
hate yourself a lot less.

386
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,030
So, you got that going for ya.

387
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:45,078
Sooner or later, you gotta
face that devil inside yourself.

388
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,543
That motherfucker.

389
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,353
Oh, my God. Oh, God!

390
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,083
- Oh, my God!
- Right there.

391
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,526
- Oh, fuck!
- Give it to me.

392
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:19,172
Oh, God!

393
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,996
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

394
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,345
Oh, fuck!

395
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,538
Oh, shit.

396
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,708
Hey.

397
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,627
Everybody, listen up.

398
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:37,381
I just want to apologize, alright?

399
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,009
I'm sorry for everything
I did to you in the past.

400
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:42,678
Rocio,

401
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,323
I'm sorry that I messed up
your son's primero communion

402
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,107
by telling him
he was possessed by the devil.

403
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,744
And I'm sorry that I tagged
a dick on your car in high school.

404
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,287
- I fucking knew it!
- Shh. Shh.

405
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,498
They called me dick girl
for a whole year.

406
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:54,565
I know.

407
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,985
I was also one of the fools
that called you that.

408
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,194
My primo Johnny,

409
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:01,947
sorry that I slept with your wife.

410
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:04,384
What up, Myra?

411
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:05,492
That wasn't right, primo.

412
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,929
Even if it was only because
you weren't putting it down.

413
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:10,974
Luis, stay on track, buddy.

414
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,878
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
- Nah, this feels good.

415
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,372
Right, minister, thank you.

416
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,170
To my tío Eugenio,

417
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:18,672
I'm sorry for robbing you

418
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,608
and for making fun of you

419
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,752
because you were so scared
that you pissed your pants.

420
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,428
That shit was hilarious.

421
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,305
But perdon, tío.

422
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,515
And, Ana,

423
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:31,035
I'm sorry I made your home girl Loretta cry

424
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,829
because she had a big forehead
and I called her Forhedda,

425
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,998
and all the homeys was like, Damn,
my boy has to go," and I say, "Yeah."

426
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,702
But looking back on it, that wasn't right.

427
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:40,194
I'm sorry to my homie Spider.

428
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,589
Sorry that I borrowed money from you.

429
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:45,049
And then paid you back
with money that I stole from you.

430
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,634
That wasn't right, big dawg.

431
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:49,578
But my advice is, you know,
keep your feria in a safe.

432
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,265
To my cousin Miguel,

433
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:55,584
I'm sorry that whenever we played,
I always socked you in your face.

434
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,253
But you gotta practice
your self-defense, my boy.

435
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,690
And my tía Sofia,

436
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:03,634
perdón por robarle
el catalítico a tu carro.

437
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,488
And to my cousin Ricky,

438
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:08,656
I'm sorry that one time
the police pulled us over

439
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,908
and I had that gun on me.

440
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:11,784
And, you know, I just said it was yours.

441
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:14,245
Because I remember you saying
you loved that movie Blood In, Blood Out.

442
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,247
So I said, fuck it,
let that fool experience

443
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,999
prison if he loves that movie so much.

444
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:19,441
Lo siento, primo.
