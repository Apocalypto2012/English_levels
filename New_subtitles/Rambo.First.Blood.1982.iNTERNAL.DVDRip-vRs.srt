1
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,470
Excuse me, can you tell me
this, where Delmare Berry lives?

2
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,822
He ain't here.

3
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,343
Go on inside, baby.

4
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:37,330
He's a friend of mine...

5
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:42,925
Well in fact, he wrote his
address down...right here.

6
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:45,738
Here.

7
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:48,341
You can see that's Delmare's writing.

8
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,487
I sure had a hard
time finding this place!

9
00:02:50,883 --> 00:02:54,132
- That's his writin'.
- Like I said, he's a friend.

10
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:58,798
My name is John Rambo. We served
on the same team together in Nam.

11
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:01,256
I don't know if he
ever talked about me...

12
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:06,213
I've got a picture of us together.

13
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:08,545
Somewhere...

14
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,171
This junk in my pocket!

15
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:13,962
Here...here it is.

16
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:19,296
That's me, that's Danforth,
Westmore, Bronson, Ortega,

17
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:21,649
and there's Delmare, right in the back.

18
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,503
We had to put him in the
back because he's so big,

19
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:25,773
if we didn't, he'd take
up the whole picture!

20
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:27,273
Delmare's gone.

21
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:32,186
- What time will he be back?
- He died.

22
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:33,540
What?

23
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:36,480
Died last summer.

24
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:39,771
Died how?

25
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,791
Cancer. Brought it back from Nam.

26
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,310
All that orange stuff
they spread it around.

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,372
Cut him down to nothing. I
couldn't lift him off the sheet.

28
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:04,600
I'm very sorry.

29
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:02,883
Morning Amy! How are you doing, girls?

30
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:04,945
- Great, thanks.
- Alright this morning?

31
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:09,549
- Andy!
- Howdy, Will!

32
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:24,691
- Good morning, Dave!
- Hi, Sheriff!

33
00:05:25,006 --> 00:05:26,734
Gonna take a bath this week?!

34
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:35,857
Morning!

35
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:43,814
You...you visiting someone around here?

36
00:05:45,356 --> 00:05:46,396
No.

37
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:52,230
You know, wearing that flag on that
jacket, looking the way you do...

38
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:55,312
you're askin' for
trouble around here, friend!

39
00:05:57,021 --> 00:06:00,562
- Headed North or South?
- North.

40
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:05,687
Jump in, I'll make sure you
head in the right direction, huh!

41
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:20,267
- Where you heading?
- Portland.

42
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:23,351
Portland is South, you said
you were headed North.

43
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:26,682
You got some place I
can eat around here?

44
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:31,496
There's a diner about
30 miles up the highway.

45
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,764
Is there a law against me
getting something to eat here?

46
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:38,034
Yeah, me.

47
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:41,806
Why are you pushin' me?

48
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:44,929
What did you say?

49
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:48,304
l said why are you pushing me,
I haven't done anything to you.

50
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:51,845
First of all, you don't ask the
questions around here, I do. Understand?

51
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:57,553
Secondly...we don't want
guys like you in this town.

52
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:00,968
Drifters.

53
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,467
First thing you know
we got a whole bunch

54
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:04,969
of guys like you in
this town. That's why!

55
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,507
Besides, you wouldn't like it here...

56
00:07:10,593 --> 00:07:12,258
It's a quiet little town.

57
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,300
In fact, you might say it's boring!

58
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:17,988
But that's the way we like it.

59
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,862
And I get paid to keep it that way.

60
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:24,341
Boring...

61
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:41,797
Portland, straight ahead!

62
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:46,234
If you want some friendly advice...

63
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:51,441
Get your hair cut and take a bath.
You wouldn't get hassled so much!

64
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:53,753
Hope this ride helped you out!

65
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,983
Have a nice day, huh!

66
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:42,393
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

67
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:45,473
Hey, I'm talkin' to you, goddammit!

68
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:51,995
Let's see some I.D.!

69
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,389
All right, you're under arrest!

70
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:57,806
You hear me? You put
your hands on the car.

71
00:08:58,265 --> 00:09:00,847
Now you put your hands on
the car, and you spread'em.

72
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:05,201
Are you gonna put
your hands on that car?

73
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:07,888
How you do it, you
decide, right now!

74
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:23,177
Put your legs back.

75
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,238
Back!

76
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:30,718
You try to be nice to some people!

77
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:36,966
Well, what do we have here, huh?

78
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,592
What would you be
carrying a knife like this?

79
00:09:43,636 --> 00:09:44,488
Hunting.

80
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:48,633
Don't be a wise guy! What
do you hunt with a knife?

81
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:51,465
Name it.

82
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:59,048
- Hi, Will.
- Lester.

83
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:01,358
Harry, buzz us in, will ya?

84
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:04,212
Hey, talk about your
sorry looking humanity!

85
00:10:04,713 --> 00:10:06,400
Just another smartass drifter.

86
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:13,295
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Will. What do you got?

87
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:15,751
I want you to book
this gentleman for

88
00:10:15,752 --> 00:10:19,836
vagrancy, resisting arrest,
carrying a concealed weapon.

89
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:21,772
He says he uses it for hunting.

90
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:25,085
Huntin'? What do you hunt, elephants?

91
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:29,084
See if you can clean him up a
little. He smells like an animal!

92
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,667
Hey, Mitch...Mitch!

93
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,083
Yo!

94
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:39,164
Escort this young man downstairs.

95
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:40,435
Yes, sir.

96
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,270
Right this way, partner.

97
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:44,417
Right here.

98
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:46,295
That's it.

99
00:10:52,454 --> 00:10:54,580
OK, here we go.

100
00:10:58,455 --> 00:10:59,963
You know, it looks
like it'll take old Leroy

101
00:10:59,964 --> 00:11:01,994
about 10 years to paint this hall!

102
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:04,390
Why don't you paint it your damned self?

103
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:06,308
Come on Leroy, sling that paint, boy!

104
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,079
Mr. Ward!

105
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:11,619
Would you take this for me, please?

106
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:21,034
Name?

107
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:27,366
Your name?

108
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:31,123
Your name!

109
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:37,176
Name!

110
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:42,342
Hey...you're lookin' to trouble?

111
00:11:43,178 --> 00:11:44,906
You came at the right place, buddy!

112
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,529
Oh, wait a second.

113
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:50,905
You got three seconds
before I break your face in!

114
00:11:51,782 --> 00:11:53,177
He means it.

115
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,113
Yeah, I do.

116
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:17,692
What do you know about that?
Old Harry here is a soldier!

117
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:20,691
Rambo...

118
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:22,397
John J.?

119
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,920
You're gonna talk to me.

120
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:30,421
I promise you're gonna
talk to me, soldier.

121
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:34,857
I'm starting to dislike you.

122
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:37,729
A lot.

123
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:41,772
I'm gonna run a make on him.

124
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,145
Put his name in the Teletype.

125
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,604
Just roll it across.

126
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:51,519
Roll it across!

127
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:54,351
Push it.

128
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:56,998
It won't work that way, it'll
only smear. Roll it across!

129
00:12:58,228 --> 00:12:59,956
Look, you son of a
bitch, if you don't put your

130
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:02,309
goddamned hand down
there, I'm gonna break it off!

131
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:06,768
- Put it down, goddammit!
- Art, what the hell's going on down here?

132
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:08,934
Nothing I can't handle.

133
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:11,683
He won't let us print him well.

134
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:14,265
Leave the ink on your hand!

135
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,160
Just what is your problem, huh?

136
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:21,515
Listen, hardass! As
things stand right now,

137
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:24,099
you're facing the ass end
of a 90 day incarceration!

138
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:28,411
Plus a 250 dollars fine, which you
don't look to me like you can pay!

139
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:31,326
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning,
you're going up in front of that judge.

140
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:33,430
And you think we're tough!

141
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:36,306
We're gonna make you
look more presentable

142
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:37,952
for your courtroom appearance.

143
00:13:39,305 --> 00:13:41,554
Between now and then, you can
just impress the hell outta me

144
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:43,907
by doing exactly as you're told.

145
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:51,325
Clean him up.

146
00:13:52,283 --> 00:13:54,449
All right, Preston,
I want you to go

147
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,135
over there and get that
hose ready, alright?

148
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:04,365
Holy shit, look at this!
What the hell's he been into?

149
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,217
Who gives a shit?

150
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,613
All right, put your hands on
top of your head and turn around.

151
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:18,403
Oh, Christ! We should report this
to Teasle, Gault! Look at that!

152
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:20,757
You just do what I tell you.

153
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,362
Gault, what the fuck was that?

154
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:30,380
Well, the Man said "clean him up".

155
00:14:33,777 --> 00:14:35,193
Clean him up!

156
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:49,857
Hey, Preston, don't forget
to get him behind the ears!

157
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,064
How'd you like that, huh?

158
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:01,063
What's the matter, Mitch?
Don't you like water sports?

159
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,311
All right, hurry it up, it's time for
my coffee break. Alright, sit down!

160
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:16,519
Sit down!

161
00:15:24,436 --> 00:15:26,954
Damn it, that boy's
hard to get a hold of!

162
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,580
That's OK, Ward, don't worry
about the soap, he's tough.

163
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:32,830
Just shave him. Dry!

164
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,665
All right...

165
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:38,370
How blind are you? Can't
you see this guy's crazy?

166
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,995
Can't you see I don't give a shit?

167
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:43,830
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Yeah, that's better.

168
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:46,659
See there, I knew that you...

169
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:50,598
We're just going to shave
you partner, take it easy!

170
00:15:51,538 --> 00:15:52,953
Take this, Mitch.

171
00:15:57,827 --> 00:15:59,139
Don't move...

172
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,285
I don't want you to cut your own throat!

173
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:17,926
You son of a bitch! Come on!

174
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:38,298
What the hell is...

175
00:16:42,473 --> 00:16:43,515
Art! Art!

176
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:01,259
Hey, you can't...

177
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:30,828
I'm gonna kill this asshole!

178
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:32,079
Art, don't shoot!

179
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:34,978
Don't shoot, there's people down there!

180
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,167
All right, get help! I'll go after him!

181
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,079
Get outta the way!

182
00:19:22,312 --> 00:19:23,668
Son of a bitch!

183
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:34,167
Lester, this is Will.
I'm right on his tail.

184
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:37,001
He's just east of Smith's farm,
headed towards Chapman Creek.

185
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:57,986
I know you can hear me!

186
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,437
You're finished!

187
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:05,972
You've gone as far as you're gonna go!

188
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:10,151
D'you hear me?

189
00:22:16,052 --> 00:22:16,782
Mitch!

190
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:18,241
Lester!

191
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:21,558
He's up there behind the draw.

192
00:22:22,494 --> 00:22:24,432
Mitch, get Orval on the radio.

193
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:28,038
Tell him to get out here with
his damned dogs right away.

194
00:22:28,537 --> 00:22:30,098
And tell him to bring the Dobermen!

195
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,493
lt's gonna rain, we'll need
dogs that can hunt on sight.

196
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:35,368
Lester, tell Paul to get
out to the lumber camp

197
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:36,848
to get the helicopter up here.

198
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:38,970
If they give him any shit, tell him to

199
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:41,742
site him for obstruction
right on the spot.

200
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,392
We'll get him!

201
00:22:46,202 --> 00:22:48,287
No problem.

202
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:22,903
Go on, Hooch! Thunder, lets get him!

203
00:23:24,818 --> 00:23:25,860
Come on, sweethearts!

204
00:23:26,694 --> 00:23:28,027
Let's go get him, babies!

205
00:23:30,194 --> 00:23:33,153
Won't be long before he's
stuffed and mounted, huh Will?

206
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:35,069
Make him into a bear rug!

207
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:36,838
Didn't we go hunting here up last year?

208
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,733
Yeah, I got a couple of bucks last year!

209
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:41,732
Hey Mitch, up the hill!

210
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,814
Get those hounds away from me,
Orval! I don't trust those bastards!

211
00:24:05,314 --> 00:24:09,105
Keep moving, my dogs can
eat and run at the same time!

212
00:24:09,562 --> 00:24:11,164
He's going straight to the top.

213
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:13,999
Isn't that supposed to be dangerous?

214
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,269
He's just dumb!

215
00:24:32,018 --> 00:24:35,516
Hey, you're spoiling the scent.
Let my babies do their job!

216
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:41,161
- This is no good.
- Why?

217
00:24:42,184 --> 00:24:44,246
There were three of us in
the cell block down there!

218
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:46,411
He went through us like
we weren't even there!

219
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:49,118
Oh, come on!

220
00:26:01,504 --> 00:26:03,982
We've got him, go ahead, he's trapped!

221
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:06,566
Art, Art! This is Teasle, he's
heading for Chapman's gorge.

222
00:26:07,171 --> 00:26:08,670
Chapman's gorge! Head him off!

223
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,831
There he is! On the cliff!

224
00:27:03,328 --> 00:27:04,744
Son of a bitch!

225
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,371
What the hell's going on?

226
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:16,824
What are you doing? We're
just supposed to spot him!

227
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:21,201
- Hold it steady.
- I can't! We're in a thermal draft!

228
00:27:21,699 --> 00:27:24,701
He's stuck there, he can't go any place.

229
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:30,801
If you don't ride this thing right,
I swear to God, I'll kill you!

230
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:34,574
Sheriff to Galt! Come in Galt.

231
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:41,383
Hold it steady, you son of a bitch!

232
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,071
Galt, come in, goddamn it!

233
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,340
Get closer and hold it steady!

234
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:49,800
Galt, talk to me, damn it! I
want to know what's going on!

235
00:27:54,023 --> 00:27:56,107
I got him...easy now.

236
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:42,603
There he is!

237
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:45,271
Over there, dummy! Come on!

238
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:51,622
Hey, soldier boy!

239
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,620
Galt, I'm tellin' you to get on this
radio! What's going on up there?

240
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:20,839
I don't want him dead, Galt,
I want him alive! You hear me?

241
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,883
Art, come in!

242
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:24,066
Art Galt, come in!
Helicopter, come in, goddamn it!

243
00:30:25,254 --> 00:30:26,296
Christ, look!

244
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:32,983
Jesus Christ, gimme the binoculars!

245
00:30:34,526 --> 00:30:36,983
Oh no, no, no! Shit!

246
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:26,054
I can't figure it...How did he fall out?

247
00:31:27,411 --> 00:31:28,348
Does it matter?

248
00:31:28,602 --> 00:31:31,267
Let's nail this sucker's
ass...He can't be far!

249
00:31:31,643 --> 00:31:32,578
Will!

250
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:37,202
Looks like he wants to turn himself in!

251
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:45,514
There's one man dead. lt's not my
fault. I don't want any more hurt.

252
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,619
Freeze!

253
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,867
Stay right where you
are and give yourself up!

254
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:52,240
But I didn't do anything!

255
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:55,471
I'm warning you, boy, don't make
a move, I'll blow your head off!

256
00:31:55,512 --> 00:31:57,011
I didn't do anything!

257
00:32:02,783 --> 00:32:05,075
Cease fire! Cease fire!

258
00:32:05,948 --> 00:32:08,239
Ward, goddamn it, cease fire!

259
00:32:10,486 --> 00:32:12,989
I think we hit him. Let
us get down there. Move!

260
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:17,241
Sheriff to base, come in.

261
00:32:21,365 --> 00:32:21,990
Go ahead, Will.

262
00:32:22,447 --> 00:32:24,061
Lester, we're down in the gorge.

263
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,176
Galt's dead, alright? Where the
hell is that goddamned chopper?

264
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:31,715
He won't come, Will. Says
there's a storm heading your way.

265
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:34,212
I don't give a goddamned
what's on its way.

266
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:35,985
I want that chopper back here right now!

267
00:32:36,565 --> 00:32:38,860
I don't want Gault's
body out here all night.

268
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:42,694
Listen, Will. You sure picked one
hell of a guy to mess around with!

269
00:32:42,773 --> 00:32:44,285
Just came over the
Teletype a few minutes ago.

270
00:32:44,286 --> 00:32:45,797
John Rambo is a Vietnam vet.

271
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:50,401
He's a Green Beret, Congressional
Medal of Honor! Guy's a war hero!

272
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,275
Jesus, that freak?!

273
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:54,608
I knew there was
something about that guy!

274
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:58,505
I double checked it, Will.
What do you want me to do?

275
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:05,459
I want you to do what I
told you to do, goddamn it!

276
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,961
Get that chopper back here now! Out.

277
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,295
Green Beret!

278
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:15,902
War hero!

279
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,707
- That's great! That's just great!
- Shut your mouth!

280
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:20,956
What the hell's the
matter with you guys?

281
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,354
He's one man...wounded!

282
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:27,976
Those Green Berets...they're
real bad asses.

283
00:33:28,437 --> 00:33:30,313
Why don't you let the
State Police handle this?

284
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,476
Look. Look at him...look at
him! That's Art Gault, boy!

285
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:44,393
He and I were friends when your

286
00:33:44,394 --> 00:33:46,768
momma was still wiping your nose!

287
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,825
Now he's dead. He's dead!
Because of that psycho out there!

288
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,232
Now you listen boy,
you listen to me good:

289
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:53,801
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch...

290
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:57,242
and I'm gonna pin that Congressional
Medal of Honor to his liver!

291
00:33:58,635 --> 00:33:59,677
And I'm gonna do it,

292
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:02,808
with you, or without you!

293
00:34:21,211 --> 00:34:23,297
We're closin' in, the
scent's getting stronger.

294
00:34:23,923 --> 00:34:25,381
All right, keep your eyes open!

295
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:32,484
It's gonna storm...it's all we need now!

296
00:34:32,485 --> 00:34:35,091
Will, c'mon, let's get out of
here before it gets too dark.

297
00:34:35,212 --> 00:34:36,986
What's the matter, you
afraid of the boogie man?

298
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,340
You goddamned pansy!

299
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,944
Put your gun down, I'll
show you who the pansy is!

300
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,440
Knock it off! Ward! Ward, move out!

301
00:34:47,441 --> 00:34:50,046
The fight is out here! He's
out there waiting for you.

302
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,839
Mitch, get on your feet and move!

303
00:34:54,795 --> 00:34:57,923
Go find this guy for Chrissakes!
Keep your eyes open!

304
00:34:58,502 --> 00:35:00,588
- I'll see you later, Ward!
- Shut up, Mitch.

305
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:10,460
There he is!

306
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:14,105
Let them dogs loose, Orval!

307
00:35:14,835 --> 00:35:16,921
Go get him sweethearts!
Here's your dinner!

308
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,916
Cease fire!

309
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,022
Goddammit, I'm hit!

310
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:40,289
Jesus, he's got a gun..

311
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:51,997
It's not him, it's a
goddamned scarecrow!

312
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,932
No scarecrow that
shot Orville, he's close.

313
00:35:57,492 --> 00:35:58,536
Kill him! Go get him!

314
00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:01,788
Go get him, Maggie!

315
00:36:14,578 --> 00:36:18,453
Mitch, Ward, come here!
Shingleton, you cover us.

316
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:21,199
Look at his leg!

317
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,868
Mitch, get your belt. Make
a tourniquet around that.

318
00:36:23,363 --> 00:36:24,876
We got to get this guy to a doctor!

319
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:27,326
Goddamnit, get your belt on that
fast! Where's the first-aid kit?

320
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:28,361
I left it in the car.

321
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:29,405
Shit!

322
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:32,219
- Where did he get that gun?
- It's gotta be Art Gault's gun.

323
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:34,332
- He's outta ammo...
- How do you know that?

324
00:36:34,647 --> 00:36:37,240
Because whatever killed Orval's
dog was no bullet, that's how!

325
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:40,052
Hurry up! Orval, listen
to me, now listen!

326
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:41,927
You have to stay awake, all right?

327
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:44,347
You have to release that
tourniquet every 15 minutes.

328
00:36:44,348 --> 00:36:47,318
We'll be right back! We go
get him now, he's outta ammo.

329
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:51,442
Get him! He had no right to shoot
my babies. Get the son of a bitch!

330
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:52,923
- Let's go!
- Go get him!

331
00:36:55,068 --> 00:36:57,610
All right, now listen up!

332
00:36:58,236 --> 00:36:59,330
We're right on top of him.

333
00:36:59,331 --> 00:37:01,364
We're gonna form a
skirmish line, 50 feet apart.

334
00:37:01,546 --> 00:37:03,840
Keep moving, there's no way
outta here, except through us.

335
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,894
OK, let's do some huntin'...

336
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:13,548
Huntin'? We ain't
huntin' him, he's huntin' us!

337
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:31,523
Spread out. Spread out,
dammit! I said 50 feet!

338
00:37:56,876 --> 00:37:57,919
I hate this!

339
00:39:11,988 --> 00:39:13,032
Will, it's Mitch!

340
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,528
Who is it?

341
00:39:51,395 --> 00:39:52,855
- What's goin' on?
- Shut up!

342
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:58,999
He's got Ward. Spread
out, I'll go this way.

343
00:40:09,013 --> 00:40:10,055
Will! Over here!

344
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:15,645
Who's firing?

345
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:18,391
Who's firing?

346
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:19,745
I got him!

347
00:40:20,516 --> 00:40:21,868
Shingleton, follow me!

348
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:28,848
Will, help me!

349
00:40:30,102 --> 00:40:31,144
Help me, Will!

350
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,914
Balford? Where the hell are you?!

351
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:52,036
Shingleton, over here!

352
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:10,763
Shingleton, where the hell are you?!

353
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:38,319
I could have killed'em all.
I could have killed you.

354
00:41:39,524 --> 00:41:41,714
In town you're the law,
out here, it's me!

355
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:47,462
Don't push it! Don't push it, or I'll
give you a war you won't believe!

356
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:51,734
Let it go.

357
00:41:53,898 --> 00:41:54,940
Let it go.

358
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,852
Move back, you guys, move back!

359
00:42:59,472 --> 00:43:01,974
How bad is the situation?
Captain, we need some...

360
00:43:02,928 --> 00:43:04,493
That's the only good thing about this,

361
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:06,056
is the business you're doing in town!

362
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:08,974
Reporters are drinking the place dry.

363
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,559
You look like you're
ready to keel over, Will.

364
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,635
Why don't you go
home? It's my problem now.

365
00:43:16,734 --> 00:43:19,237
Your problem? Listen Dave,
don't give me any of your

366
00:43:19,238 --> 00:43:22,052
horsehit about jurisdiction
in this one, you understand?

367
00:43:22,757 --> 00:43:25,364
- Should I step outside?
- Just finish up what you're doing.

368
00:43:26,902 --> 00:43:30,344
Somewhere in this rugged mountain
countryside, possibly above the snow line,

369
00:43:31,488 --> 00:43:34,617
shrouded in mist, the
fugitive John Rambo, is hiding.

370
00:43:34,657 --> 00:43:36,010
Units of the state
police along with local

371
00:43:36,011 --> 00:43:40,072
members of the National
Guard are now being mobilized.

372
00:43:40,688 --> 00:43:43,138
What still remains
unexplained by local authorities

373
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:45,068
is just how and where
the former Green Beret

374
00:43:45,525 --> 00:43:46,775
came into possession of the weapons

375
00:43:46,776 --> 00:43:49,697
with which he allegedly
killed one deputy sheriff,

376
00:43:50,104 --> 00:43:51,460
and tried to kill 6 others.

377
00:43:51,775 --> 00:43:53,651
Only their skilled training
in police enforcement

378
00:43:53,652 --> 00:43:55,529
techniques saved their lives.

379
00:43:55,607 --> 00:43:57,536
And word now is that
the fugitive will be

380
00:43:57,537 --> 00:43:59,674
in custody in a matter of hours.

381
00:44:01,753 --> 00:44:02,958
Maps, Will.

382
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,819
Will, there's something
I think you oughta know.

383
00:44:07,923 --> 00:44:09,278
I'll talk to you later, OK?

384
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:11,939
What is it, Lester? What is it
for Christ sake, spit it out!

385
00:44:14,878 --> 00:44:18,357
Well, I was just talkin' to
Mitch, and he was sayin' that

386
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:22,253
Gault and a couple of deputies
were...a little hard on the guy.

387
00:44:22,836 --> 00:44:23,879
Assholes!

388
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:28,374
It doesn't make one goddammed bit
of difference, Dave, and you know it!

389
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:34,425
If one of my deputies...gets
outta line with a prisoner,

390
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:35,833
then the prisoner
comes to me with it!

391
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:38,837
And if I find out it's like he
says, I kick the deputy's ass!

392
00:44:38,914 --> 00:44:41,312
Me, the law! That's
the way it's gotta be.

393
00:44:43,287 --> 00:44:46,623
People start fuckin' around with
the law, and all hell breaks loose.

394
00:44:49,993 --> 00:44:51,766
Whatever possessed God in
heaven to make a man like Rambo?

395
00:44:52,496 --> 00:44:53,851
God didn't make Rambo.

396
00:44:55,372 --> 00:44:56,415
I made him.

397
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:57,998
Who the hell are you?

398
00:44:58,597 --> 00:45:01,412
Sam Trautman. Colonel Samuel Trautman.

399
00:45:02,471 --> 00:45:04,973
We're a little busy this morning,
Colonel, what can I do for ya?

400
00:45:05,006 --> 00:45:06,883
- I've come to get my boy.
- Your boy?

401
00:45:07,511 --> 00:45:11,472
I recruited him, I trained him, I
commanded him in Vietnam for 3 years.

402
00:45:12,673 --> 00:45:13,716
I'd say that makes him mine.

403
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,324
I wonder why the Pentagon would

404
00:45:16,325 --> 00:45:19,347
send a full bird Colonel to handle this?

405
00:45:20,225 --> 00:45:22,310
The army thought I
might be able to help.

406
00:45:22,408 --> 00:45:24,180
I don't know in what way.

407
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:25,953
Rambo's a civilian now, he's my problem.

408
00:45:27,506 --> 00:45:31,573
I don't think you understand. I didn't
come here to rescue Rambo from you.

409
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,886
I came here to rescue you from him.

410
00:45:35,422 --> 00:45:37,612
Well, we all appreciate
your concern, Colonel.

411
00:45:38,342 --> 00:45:39,906
We'll try to be extra careful!

412
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,528
I'm just amazed he allowed
any of your posse to live.

413
00:45:44,365 --> 00:45:45,302
Is that right?

414
00:45:45,693 --> 00:45:49,134
Strictly speaking, he slipped up.
You're lucky to be breathing!

415
00:45:49,135 --> 00:45:50,177
That's just great!

416
00:45:51,847 --> 00:45:52,595
Colonel, you came out here

417
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:55,324
to find out why one of
your machines blew a gasket!

418
00:45:55,968 --> 00:45:57,957
You don't seem to want to
accept the fact that you're

419
00:45:57,958 --> 00:46:00,572
dealing with an expert
in guerilla warfare.

420
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:02,612
With a man who's the best.

421
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:05,341
With guns, with knives,
with his bare hands.

422
00:46:06,008 --> 00:46:09,883
A man who's been trained to
ignore pain, ignore weather.

423
00:46:10,757 --> 00:46:12,736
To live off the land...

424
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:15,132
To eat things that would
make a billy goat puke.

425
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:20,422
In Vietnam, his job was to dispose
of enemy personnel, to kill...period!

426
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:25,381
Win by attrition. Well,
Rambo was the best!

427
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,913
OK, Colonel, now you've
got us all scared to death.

428
00:47:23,914 --> 00:47:26,287
What do you and the Special Forces think

429
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:28,652
I oughta do about your psycho out there?

430
00:47:30,529 --> 00:47:31,539
Let him go.

431
00:47:31,622 --> 00:47:33,306
- Do what?
- For now.

432
00:47:34,703 --> 00:47:36,702
Defuse the whole situation, defuse him.

433
00:47:37,536 --> 00:47:39,848
Provide a little gap and
let him slip through it.

434
00:47:40,347 --> 00:47:43,223
Then put out a nation wide
APB. In a couple of weeks,

435
00:47:43,224 --> 00:47:45,993
you'll pick him up in Seattle or
someplace, working in a car wash.

436
00:47:46,035 --> 00:47:47,493
There'll be no fight and
nobody else will get hurt.

437
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:50,116
I do my own work. I don't
figure the best way to do that is

438
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,805
to close my eyes and then hope
he gets picked up in Seattle!

439
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:55,722
If you send your people in
there after him, they'll get killed!

440
00:47:55,804 --> 00:47:58,428
You know, we're just a small
hick town Sheriff's department,

441
00:47:58,429 --> 00:48:00,529
Colonel, but we're
expected to do our duty

442
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:02,653
just like our heroes
in the Special Forces.

443
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:06,114
In Special Forces, we teach our
people to stay alive in the line of duty.

444
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:08,097
No shit, I never thought of that!

445
00:48:08,137 --> 00:48:09,196
You want a war you can't win?

446
00:48:09,302 --> 00:48:13,488
Are you tellin' me that 200 men against
your boy is a no win situation for us?

447
00:48:13,796 --> 00:48:15,517
You send that many,
don't forget one thing.

448
00:48:15,622 --> 00:48:16,506
What?

449
00:48:16,819 --> 00:48:18,488
A good supply of body-bags!

450
00:48:22,071 --> 00:48:23,215
Trautman!

451
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:27,860
I don't know which side
you're on, Trautman...

452
00:48:28,486 --> 00:48:30,924
I still think you came out
here just to cover your ass.

453
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:35,421
But if you're serious about taking
Rambo out clean, follow me...

454
00:48:56,753 --> 00:48:59,961
State police calling John
Rambo. Acknowledge.

455
00:49:06,355 --> 00:49:11,333
State police calling John Rambo.
Come in please. Acknowledge!

456
00:49:13,188 --> 00:49:16,977
If you're listening, Rambo, here's
your situation: you are surrounded.

457
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:19,790
Every possible exit has been blocked,

458
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:22,353
every highway, every
road, every fire break.

459
00:49:22,576 --> 00:49:24,296
You have our word that
your services to your

460
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:26,017
country will be taken
into consideration.

461
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:27,765
And you'll receive fair treatment.

462
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,163
Just respond, we can
work everything out...over.

463
00:49:31,998 --> 00:49:32,787
Anything?

464
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:37,038
- He took a radio off one of my deputies.
- Then he has to be listening.

465
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:39,034
If I was in his position,
I'd try to pick up

466
00:49:39,035 --> 00:49:41,432
some information. Maybe
catch some cross talk.

467
00:49:41,954 --> 00:49:42,789
Of course, he's listening.

468
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:44,493
He's not gonna break radio silence.

469
00:49:44,494 --> 00:49:47,620
No, not for us, but he
might do it for you, Colonel.

470
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:49,826
He's your boy, isn't he?

471
00:49:52,704 --> 00:49:56,366
Maybe you can talk him into sparing
all our lives by giving himself up.

472
00:49:57,283 --> 00:49:58,345
I can try.

473
00:49:58,951 --> 00:50:01,326
At least, we'd get a
radio fix on his position,

474
00:50:01,327 --> 00:50:02,764
if you don't mind
setting him up for us...

475
00:50:02,805 --> 00:50:04,230
Setting him up for you?

476
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,803
It's like bringing the
pigeons to the cat!

477
00:50:12,784 --> 00:50:14,366
Thanks for bringing your people out.

478
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:15,323
Any time, Will.

479
00:50:15,407 --> 00:50:17,552
C'mon, Bobby, put the
magazine away, will ya?

480
00:50:17,553 --> 00:50:20,218
Pay attention. I mean we
may only get one crack at this.

481
00:50:25,363 --> 00:50:28,383
Company leader calling
Raven. Come on Raven.

482
00:50:31,216 --> 00:50:32,734
Company leader calling Raven.

483
00:50:37,255 --> 00:50:40,378
Company leader to
Raven. Talk to me, Johnny.

484
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:44,919
Company leader to identify Baker Team:

485
00:50:45,899 --> 00:50:50,357
Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta,

486
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:55,106
Jorgensen, Danforth, Berry, Krakauer.

487
00:50:55,814 --> 00:50:56,666
Confirm.

488
00:50:57,585 --> 00:50:58,832
This is Colonel Trautman.

489
00:51:01,104 --> 00:51:02,394
Talk to me, Johnny.

490
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:19,186
They're all gone, Sir.

491
00:51:19,686 --> 00:51:23,456
- That's him, get on it.
- Rambo. Are you alright? Over.

492
00:51:23,496 --> 00:51:25,288
Baker team, they're all dead, Sir.

493
00:51:26,621 --> 00:51:29,371
Not Delmare Berry, he made it.

494
00:51:29,871 --> 00:51:31,454
Berry's gone too, Sir.

495
00:51:32,893 --> 00:51:33,828
How?

496
00:51:34,536 --> 00:51:36,244
Got himself killed in Nam...

497
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:39,725
Didn't even know it. Cancer
ate him down to the bone.

498
00:51:41,036 --> 00:51:42,869
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

499
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,764
I'm the last one, Sir.

500
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:49,658
lt's good to hear your voice,
Johnny. It's been a long time!

501
00:51:51,618 --> 00:51:54,180
Look, John, you've
done some damage here,

502
00:51:54,181 --> 00:51:55,177
but they don't want any more trouble.

503
00:51:55,283 --> 00:51:56,638
He's north-west!

504
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,762
That's why I've come.

505
00:52:00,014 --> 00:52:01,678
I'm gonna come in
and fly you the hell out.

506
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:05,657
Just you and me. We'll work this
out together. Is that fair enough?

507
00:52:06,658 --> 00:52:07,927
Where'd you come from, Sir?

508
00:52:08,344 --> 00:52:09,407
Bragg.

509
00:52:11,157 --> 00:52:12,321
I tried to get in touch with you,

510
00:52:12,322 --> 00:52:14,530
but the guys at Bragg
never knew where to find you.

511
00:52:14,614 --> 00:52:16,904
Well, I haven't been spending
much time there lately,

512
00:52:16,905 --> 00:52:20,030
they've got me down in DC.
I'm shining a seat with my ass.

513
00:52:20,655 --> 00:52:22,488
I wish I was back in Bragg now.

514
00:52:25,488 --> 00:52:27,341
We'll talk about that when you come in.

515
00:52:27,342 --> 00:52:28,986
I can't do that, Sir.

516
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:34,372
Well, look, John, we can't have
you running around out there,

517
00:52:34,477 --> 00:52:35,840
wasting friendly civilians.

518
00:52:36,485 --> 00:52:39,443
- There are no friendly civilians.
- I'm your friend, Johnny.

519
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:42,850
I was there with you, knee
deep in blood and guts.

520
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:45,693
I covered your ass more than once!

521
00:52:48,694 --> 00:52:50,035
Seems like bailing you out of trouble

522
00:52:50,036 --> 00:52:51,691
is becoming a lifetime job for me!

523
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:54,546
There wouldn't be no trouble
except for that king shit cop!

524
00:52:55,629 --> 00:52:56,982
All I wanted was something to eat.

525
00:52:58,524 --> 00:53:00,253
But the man kept pushin', Sir.

526
00:53:01,297 --> 00:53:03,129
Well, you did some
pushin' on your own, John!

527
00:53:04,191 --> 00:53:05,750
They drew first blood, not me.

528
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:06,771
Look Johnny...

529
00:53:08,024 --> 00:53:09,916
Let me come in, and get
you the hell outta there.

530
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,104
They drew first blood...

531
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:24,666
Rambo! Are you still reading me?

532
00:53:29,477 --> 00:53:31,144
Company leader to Raven!

533
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:33,748
Rambo, acknowledge!

534
00:53:35,332 --> 00:53:36,809
He's all finished, Colonel!

535
00:53:37,978 --> 00:53:39,830
We've got a real good fix on him now.

536
00:53:40,248 --> 00:53:42,725
Come first light, I'm gonna put
every man I got upon that ridge.

537
00:53:43,558 --> 00:53:45,204
Then we'll get him my way!

538
00:53:51,016 --> 00:53:52,682
Goddammit.

539
00:53:54,348 --> 00:53:55,223
Goddammit!

540
00:54:05,514 --> 00:54:07,265
Come on, move it!

541
00:54:09,142 --> 00:54:09,977
Let's go!

542
00:54:12,012 --> 00:54:13,720
Does this guy got a gun?

543
00:55:24,689 --> 00:55:25,927
There's the guy the
cops are shootin' at!

544
00:55:25,928 --> 00:55:28,939
I see him over there,
I'll get him, I'll get him!

545
00:55:29,438 --> 00:55:30,646
Don't shoot!

546
00:55:31,877 --> 00:55:32,999
This way! Let's go!

547
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,354
There he is! Come on!

548
00:55:58,706 --> 00:56:00,454
Now we got him!

549
00:56:04,413 --> 00:56:07,184
Yes, I know exactly where it is.
Now listen to me very carefully.

550
00:56:07,706 --> 00:56:09,849
Surround the area with every
man you've got, but don't move in.

551
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,206
I repeat: don't move in!

552
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:14,162
Don't do anything till I get
there! And no shooting!

553
00:56:14,372 --> 00:56:15,932
I don't want him dead, I want him alive!

554
00:56:33,886 --> 00:56:35,635
Keep firing!

555
00:56:37,678 --> 00:56:39,594
Come on guys, shoot!

556
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:42,719
Come on!

557
00:56:45,031 --> 00:56:46,259
You guys are great!

558
00:56:47,384 --> 00:56:48,529
- All right, Steve.
- Yo!

559
00:56:49,051 --> 00:56:50,300
I want you and Bruce,
head around these trees,

560
00:56:50,301 --> 00:56:51,446
go to the front of that mine.

561
00:56:51,487 --> 00:56:53,457
Screw that Clint, but
I ain't goin' up there!

562
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:54,383
No way!

563
00:56:59,194 --> 00:57:00,359
- Brandon?
- What?

564
00:57:01,298 --> 00:57:04,009
- I want you to go into that mine.
- No, not me!

565
00:57:04,048 --> 00:57:04,986
What do you mean, not me?!

566
00:57:05,404 --> 00:57:07,694
Look, I do this part time, I
didn't come here to get killed.

567
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:10,611
He's probably just waitin' for us!

568
00:57:10,652 --> 00:57:12,047
What's wrong with you, Clinton?

569
00:57:16,652 --> 00:57:20,589
Rambo! This is
Lieutenant Clinton Morgan.

570
00:57:21,379 --> 00:57:23,045
National Guard leader.

571
00:57:24,546 --> 00:57:28,960
And I'm giving you just
3.0 seconds to come on out.

572
00:57:31,045 --> 00:57:33,002
Who's got the rocket launcher?

573
00:57:33,524 --> 00:57:34,961
- I do.
- Come here, Earl.

574
00:57:35,066 --> 00:57:35,900
Right!

575
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:40,502
Rambo! This is your
last chance to come out.

576
00:57:41,606 --> 00:57:43,417
Maybe we should wait.

577
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,333
Earl, this creep is a killer!

578
00:57:46,334 --> 00:57:49,000
Besides, I'm in charge
and I say we blow it up!

579
00:57:49,248 --> 00:57:52,956
Now fire that thing! Just let
me get outta the way first.

580
00:58:18,682 --> 00:58:19,911
Give that man a cigar!

581
00:58:20,641 --> 00:58:21,892
Bull's eye!

582
00:59:02,009 --> 00:59:05,093
- Where the hell are they?
- Up the hill about 500 yards.

583
00:59:08,509 --> 00:59:10,134
Move in a little closer,
just like Iwa Jima.

584
00:59:12,842 --> 00:59:15,341
I don't believe it! Idiots!

585
00:59:16,258 --> 00:59:18,608
All right, one more for
''Soldier of Fortune''!

586
00:59:18,713 --> 00:59:19,757
Soldier of Fortune?!

587
00:59:20,235 --> 00:59:23,340
Dammit, what the hell do you
think this is, some kind of a circus?

588
00:59:23,445 --> 00:59:24,777
Get the hell outta here!

589
00:59:26,985 --> 00:59:27,775
Clinton, Jesus!

590
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:30,255
Didn't you get the word, Clinton?

591
00:59:30,256 --> 00:59:32,214
I told you people to
wait until I got up here!

592
00:59:32,254 --> 00:59:33,628
Well, he was shooting at us, Will!

593
00:59:33,629 --> 00:59:35,942
Come on! I wasn't taking any chances.

594
00:59:38,567 --> 00:59:39,564
What a mess!

595
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:44,295
We have to dig his body
out of there right away.

596
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,168
You can't get a dozer up here,

597
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:49,025
you're gonna have to find
somebody to dig him out!

598
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,022
lt's your mess, Clinton!
You clean it up.

599
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,085
Will, come on...I gotta be back
at the drug store tomorrow!

600
00:59:54,129 --> 00:59:56,607
You'd better get started
right away, Clinton!

601
00:59:59,736 --> 01:00:00,779
Shit!

602
01:00:45,846 --> 01:00:48,428
Buried in a hole by a bunch of
goddamned weekend warriors!

603
01:00:49,928 --> 01:00:51,490
Thought you said he was
the best you ever trained!

604
01:00:52,471 --> 01:00:53,782
However he may have ended up,

605
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:55,614
there was a time when
he was very special.

606
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:59,001
'Special', my ass! He was just
another drifter that broke the law.

607
01:00:59,107 --> 01:01:00,573
Vagrancy, wasn't it?

608
01:01:01,031 --> 01:01:03,906
That's gonna look real good on
his gravestone in Arlington:

609
01:01:04,636 --> 01:01:08,032
''Here lies John Rambo, winner of
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

610
01:01:08,509 --> 01:01:11,466
Survivor of countless
incursions behind enemy lines.

611
01:01:12,654 --> 01:01:15,092
Killed for vagrancy,
in 'Jerkwater', USA.

612
01:01:15,966 --> 01:01:17,881
Don't give me any of
that crap, Trautman!

613
01:01:18,819 --> 01:01:22,089
You think Rambo was the only guy
who had a tough time in Vietnam?

614
01:01:22,235 --> 01:01:24,860
He killed a police
officer, for Christ sake!

615
01:01:24,861 --> 01:01:26,754
You're goddamned lucky
he didn't kill all of you...

616
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:46,482
This character! He
comes waltzing in here,

617
01:01:46,483 --> 01:01:48,063
full of all kinds of good advice.

618
01:01:48,273 --> 01:01:51,088
And wished we'd let that
goddamned maniac go on the loose,

619
01:01:51,089 --> 01:01:52,341
so we could save our own asses!

620
01:01:52,483 --> 01:01:55,730
Well, we saved our asses, Colonel!
And we didn't let him go on the loose.

621
01:01:56,293 --> 01:02:00,564
The best man lost!
And he doesn't like it!

622
01:03:33,717 --> 01:03:36,360
- How you doin', Will?
- Hold my calls.

623
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:58,209
Colonel?

624
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:03,754
Have a seat.

625
01:06:09,963 --> 01:06:12,484
Oh miss, can you do this again, please?

626
01:06:12,485 --> 01:06:15,005
- Oh sure!
- And for my friend...?

627
01:06:15,461 --> 01:06:18,004
A shot of wild turkey.

628
01:06:19,712 --> 01:06:24,545
If I was out of line before,
I just want to apologize.

629
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:28,897
None of that makes much
difference now, does it?

630
01:06:30,813 --> 01:06:32,167
No, I guess not.

631
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:36,710
I suppose...

632
01:06:37,749 --> 01:06:39,250
I just feel...

633
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:45,249
Like you were...cheated
outta your chance?

634
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,624
I wanted to kill that kid.

635
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,373
I wanted to kill him so
bad, I could taste it.

636
01:06:52,894 --> 01:06:54,975
Doesn't sit well with that badge.

637
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:58,684
It can get confusing sometimes...

638
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,974
In Vietnam, you can bet that Rambo and

639
01:07:02,975 --> 01:07:06,996
I got pretty confused. But we had orders.

640
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,537
When in doubt...kill!

641
01:07:14,786 --> 01:07:16,347
But what the hell, you're a civilian.

642
01:07:16,348 --> 01:07:19,109
You can go home to your wife,

643
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:20,724
and your house and
your little flower garden.

644
01:07:21,183 --> 01:07:23,118
You're under no pressure
to figure all this out.

645
01:07:23,238 --> 01:07:24,124
And what about you, Colonel?

646
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:25,636
What did you figure
out from all of this, huh?

647
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:28,871
I mean what would you have
done with him if he came in?

648
01:07:29,202 --> 01:07:31,596
Would you wrap your arms
around him to give a big sloppy kiss?

649
01:07:32,096 --> 01:07:34,033
Or would you have blown his brains out?

650
01:07:42,803 --> 01:07:45,593
I couldn't answer that
until I met him face to face.

651
01:07:48,949 --> 01:07:50,697
Well, there it is.

652
01:07:52,363 --> 01:07:55,947
Just as well we never
got a chance to find out.

653
01:09:47,096 --> 01:09:48,179
Drive!

654
01:09:50,846 --> 01:09:54,782
Don't look at me, look at the road.
That's how accidents happen!

655
01:09:55,844 --> 01:09:58,927
- What's your name?
- Cathcart, Robert A.

656
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:01,281
All right, what do you
got in the back, Robert A.?

657
01:10:01,804 --> 01:10:03,345
M60.

658
01:10:06,691 --> 01:10:09,714
- OK, Robert A., get out of the truck.
- I don't got no beef with you!

659
01:10:10,965 --> 01:10:12,008
Go home! Move, go home!

660
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:39,548
Want to turn that up?

661
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,254
What's your story, Steamboat?

662
01:10:45,753 --> 01:10:48,065
Looks like somebody
pulled the plug too soon...

663
01:10:48,274 --> 01:10:51,003
That Rambo guy? He's on the loose again!

664
01:10:51,004 --> 01:10:52,046
Shit!

665
01:10:55,399 --> 01:10:58,628
Hey Will, it's Rambo! He's still around!

666
01:14:40,553 --> 01:14:44,052
- Holy fuck!
- Get out there right away. Move!

667
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:11,173
What the hell is going on?!

668
01:15:14,298 --> 01:15:16,879
- Watch yourselves!
- They're all gonna blow!

669
01:15:27,047 --> 01:15:29,336
Attention, all civilians!

670
01:15:30,212 --> 01:15:34,316
For your own safety, please
evacuate the streets immediately.

671
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:38,876
Remain indoors until you
receive further instructions.

672
01:15:38,938 --> 01:15:41,771
I repeat: this is a police emergency.

673
01:15:41,772 --> 01:15:44,500
Please evacuate the streets immediately.

674
01:16:03,082 --> 01:16:05,041
They found Rambo's body...

675
01:16:05,744 --> 01:16:08,725
As a matter of fact,
he stole an army truck

676
01:16:08,726 --> 01:16:11,184
and blew up a gas station
on the other side of town.

677
01:16:11,956 --> 01:16:13,392
The kid is resilient.

678
01:16:14,623 --> 01:16:17,077
Why don't you forget what you're
thinking and clear out while you can?

679
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:20,102
Get the fuck outta here, Trautman!
You take your advice with you.

680
01:16:21,205 --> 01:16:22,911
When I talked to you
earlier this afternoon,

681
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,556
you knew he was still alive, didn't you?

682
01:16:26,954 --> 01:16:28,432
I suspected it.

683
01:16:28,786 --> 01:16:33,744
Sure...Sure, that's why you
stuck around. You trained him.

684
01:16:34,036 --> 01:16:36,534
You taught him how to get
out of places like that cave.

685
01:16:37,451 --> 01:16:39,369
But he's not gonna
get out of this place!

686
01:16:39,826 --> 01:16:42,284
Teasle, you and all your men
couldn't handle him before,

687
01:16:42,285 --> 01:16:44,116
what makes you think
you can handle him now?

688
01:16:45,244 --> 01:16:47,260
Because God knows what
damage he's prepared to do.

689
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,822
You're gonna die, Teasle.

690
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:03,156
Everybody dies!

691
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,594
There's only one man in this
room that has half a chance.

692
01:17:06,595 --> 01:17:08,531
That's not because
I'm better than he is.

693
01:17:08,989 --> 01:17:10,531
But it's because he trusts me.

694
01:17:10,988 --> 01:17:13,007
See, I'm the closest thing
to family that he has left,

695
01:17:13,113 --> 01:17:15,443
and that may be all the edge I need.

696
01:17:15,904 --> 01:17:18,194
Jesus Christ, where do
you people come from?

697
01:17:23,362 --> 01:17:26,172
This is my job Trautman,
this is my town!

698
01:17:26,526 --> 01:17:30,049
And I'm not giving it up to you,
or to Rambo or anybody else!

699
01:17:30,611 --> 01:17:33,944
Now you just stay the hell outta my way!

700
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:45,316
- Get a little closer!
- I can't!

701
01:17:45,358 --> 01:17:46,773
lt's too goddamned hot!

702
01:17:48,692 --> 01:17:50,541
Will, it's Lester, do you copy, over?

703
01:17:52,606 --> 01:17:55,772
Come on, let's go! Will, this
is Lester, do you copy, over?

704
01:17:56,982 --> 01:18:01,980
Listen Will, we've got some serious
problems. The highway's been cut off.

705
01:18:02,064 --> 01:18:05,272
The truck's out here, but
we couldn't find the body.

706
01:18:05,729 --> 01:18:07,332
I repeat: no body,
it's totally burnt out.

707
01:18:07,334 --> 01:18:09,248
Preston, get those people outta here!

708
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:12,310
Move them back to the south side.

709
01:18:14,062 --> 01:18:18,851
We don't know how many gas
tanks there are under the pumps...

710
01:24:10,506 --> 01:24:13,466
Go ahead...go ahead!

711
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:16,237
Go ahead, you crazy
son of a bitch, finish me!

712
01:24:16,342 --> 01:24:17,423
Rambo!

713
01:24:18,382 --> 01:24:19,921
Rambo, don't do it!

714
01:24:20,879 --> 01:24:22,191
Listen to me, Rambo!

715
01:24:22,546 --> 01:24:23,546
You have no chance.

716
01:24:25,047 --> 01:24:26,067
Drop your weapon.

717
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:31,086
We're gonna order a chopper
in and fly you back to Bragg.

718
01:24:33,379 --> 01:24:34,482
Hold your fire!

719
01:24:39,173 --> 01:24:40,106
Hold your fire!

720
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:42,192
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

721
01:24:43,293 --> 01:24:44,791
Think about what you're doin'.

722
01:24:46,794 --> 01:24:50,084
The building's perimeter's
covered. No exits.

723
01:24:50,751 --> 01:24:53,459
There's nearly 200 men
out there and a lot of M16s!

724
01:24:53,918 --> 01:24:56,164
You did everything to make
this private war happen.

725
01:24:57,499 --> 01:24:59,332
You've done enough damage!

726
01:24:59,749 --> 01:25:02,000
This mission is over, Rambo.
Do you understand me?

727
01:25:03,499 --> 01:25:04,644
This mission is over!

728
01:25:08,207 --> 01:25:09,538
Look at 'em out there.

729
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:13,892
Look at 'em!

730
01:25:16,996 --> 01:25:18,744
If you won't end this
happen, they'll kill you!

731
01:25:20,247 --> 01:25:21,685
Is that what you want?

732
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:27,932
lt's over, Johnny. lt's OVER!

733
01:25:28,287 --> 01:25:32,952
Nothing is over! Nothing!
You just don't turn it off!

734
01:25:33,621 --> 01:25:36,970
lt wasn't my war. You
asked me, I didn't ask you!

735
01:25:37,785 --> 01:25:40,972
And I did what I had to do to win,
but someone wouldn't let us win.

736
01:25:41,535 --> 01:25:44,014
And I come back to
the world, and I see all

737
01:25:44,015 --> 01:25:46,701
those maggots at the
airport, protestin' me, spittin'.

738
01:25:47,265 --> 01:25:49,677
Callin' me baby killer
and all kinds of vile crap!

739
01:25:51,034 --> 01:25:53,641
Who are they to protest
me, huh? Who are they?

740
01:25:53,822 --> 01:25:55,387
Unless they've been me and been there,

741
01:25:55,388 --> 01:25:57,054
and know what the
hell they're yellin' about?

742
01:25:57,095 --> 01:26:00,511
It was a bad time for everyone,
Rambo. It's all in the past now.

743
01:26:00,554 --> 01:26:03,167
FOR YOU! For me,
civilian life is nothing.

744
01:26:03,897 --> 01:26:05,571
In the field, we had a code of honor.

745
01:26:05,823 --> 01:26:09,052
You watch my back, I watch
yours. Back here, there's nothing!

746
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:13,093
You're the last of an elite
group...don't end it like this.

747
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:15,718
Back there I could fly a
gunship, I could drive a tank,

748
01:26:15,822 --> 01:26:17,779
I was in charge of a
million dollar equipment!

749
01:26:18,028 --> 01:26:21,050
Back here, I can't even
hold a job parking cars!

750
01:26:31,111 --> 01:26:32,171
Where is everybody?

751
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:41,066
I had a friend, who
was in the Air Force.

752
01:26:42,858 --> 01:26:47,149
There were all these guys, man.
Back there were all these fuckin guys!

753
01:26:47,608 --> 01:26:49,234
Who were my friends!

754
01:26:49,275 --> 01:26:52,480
Back here, there's nothing!
Remember Dan Forest?

755
01:26:54,065 --> 01:26:54,937
Wore this black headband.

756
01:26:55,148 --> 01:26:57,272
I took one of his magic
markers, and I said:

757
01:26:57,314 --> 01:26:59,814
"If found, you mail this to Las Vegas",

758
01:26:59,815 --> 01:27:01,583
'cause we were always
talkin' about Vegas,

759
01:27:01,678 --> 01:27:05,276
and this fuckin' car. This so
great '58 Chevy convertible!

760
01:27:05,277 --> 01:27:06,684
He was talkin' about his car,

761
01:27:06,685 --> 01:27:09,707
he said we'd get cruised
till the tires fell off!

762
01:27:17,645 --> 01:27:19,811
We were in this bar in
Saigon, and this kid comes up,

763
01:27:20,437 --> 01:27:22,497
this kid carrying a shoe shine box.

764
01:27:22,685 --> 01:27:25,290
And there, he says:
''Shine please, shine!''

765
01:27:25,851 --> 01:27:29,060
I said no, and he kept askin',
yeah, and Joe would say 'yeah'.

766
01:27:29,518 --> 01:27:31,370
And...I went to get a couple of beers.

767
01:27:32,101 --> 01:27:35,101
And the box was wired.
He opened up the box...

768
01:27:35,557 --> 01:27:37,412
Fucking blew his
body all over the place.

769
01:27:38,641 --> 01:27:40,100
He's laying there and
he's fucking screaming,

770
01:27:40,101 --> 01:27:41,661
there's pieces of him all over me!

771
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:47,036
And I'm trying to pull them off, you
know...my friend! It's all over me!

772
01:27:47,848 --> 01:27:49,160
I got blood and everything and...

773
01:27:49,161 --> 01:27:51,723
I'm trying to hold him
together, I put him together

774
01:27:51,765 --> 01:27:53,722
the fucking entrails keep coming out!

775
01:27:54,181 --> 01:27:56,015
And nobody would help!

776
01:27:56,514 --> 01:28:00,553
He's saying, sayin', ''I want to
go home!'' just calling my name.

777
01:28:01,012 --> 01:28:03,721
''I wanna go home, Johnny,
I wanna drive my Chevy!"

778
01:28:03,763 --> 01:28:05,971
I said: "Why I can't
find your fuckin' legs."

779
01:28:06,845 --> 01:28:08,344
''I can't find your legs!''

780
01:28:10,095 --> 01:28:14,720
I can't get it out of my
head. lt was seven years.

781
01:28:15,219 --> 01:28:16,718
Every day it hurts.

782
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:23,093
Sometimes I wake up and don't know
where I am. I don't talk to anybody.

783
01:28:23,885 --> 01:28:25,760
Sometimes a day.

784
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:29,342
Sometimes a week.

785
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:33,176
I can't put it outta my mind...
