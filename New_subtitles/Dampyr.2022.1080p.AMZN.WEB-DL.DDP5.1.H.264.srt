1
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,093
Draka!

2
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,055
Where are you?

3
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,396
Here he comes.

4
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,856
We'll take care of the mother.

5
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,274
You keep him out.

6
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,067
-Come on. Push, my dear.
-Come on, push.

7
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,462
Draka!

8
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:44,850
Push.

9
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,776
Draka!

10
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,347
The mother is dead.

11
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,390
The child lives.

12
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,705
Give me my son.

13
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,507
You can't have him.

14
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,177
He's under our protection.

15
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,639
It is our duty to raise him.

16
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,726
Until he's able to make his own choices.

17
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,401
The Dampyr lives.

18
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,522
Someone enjoyed themselves here.

19
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,232
Good of command to tell us
the town had been reclaimed.

20
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,371
Now we'll have to do
the gravediggers' job.

21
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,603
What the fuck happened to these bodies?

22
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,777
Where is the blood?

23
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,207
Looks like nobody was spared.

24
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,418
Military...

25
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,336
civilians.

26
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:48,881
Did they kill each other?

27
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:50,966
Don't talk shit.

28
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,011
Someone always survives a fight.

29
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,397
Looks like the work of wolves.

30
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:13,822
It was...

31
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,284
Easy.

32
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:19,786
...the devil.

33
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,249
It was the devil.

34
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,630
What happened here, old man?

35
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,799
They opened fire...

36
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,430
-my people in the church...
-Easy.

37
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:42,392
-...screams, "Blood, blood, blood."
-Easy.

38
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,061
Who was it?

39
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:46,730
Did you see them?

40
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:48,607
Dampyr.

41
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,819
You must call Dampyr.
You must call Dampyr.

42
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,905
-Dampyr?
-You must call--

43
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,034
Shut the fuck up.

44
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,327
Damn it, Stefan!

45
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,706
The fuck is the matter with you?

46
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,209
He was just some crazy old fool.

47
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:13,674
Call the others.

48
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,512
Get all the bodies gathered in one place.

49
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,015
We need to bury the dead.

50
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,061
Move!

51
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,701
Let's go.

52
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,452
Don't miss anyone!

53
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,247
Move them over there.

54
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:05,309
Harlan.

55
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,644
Come here to me.

56
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,448
-Another one of your nightmares?
-Yeah.

57
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,450
They're getting worse, Yuri.

58
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,792
Maybe if you quit drinking that crap.

59
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,503
You're too young to be my father.

60
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,172
But not too young
to be your manager, Harlan.

61
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,134
I want you in good shape.
We have a lot of work to do.

62
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,844
I'm in perfect shape. Can't you see?

63
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:42,721
Stop calling it "work."

64
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,889
It is work.

65
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:45,891
Puts food on the table.

66
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,811
-Where are you taking me?
-Jostanira.

67
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,688
Their cemetery is infested.

68
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,440
Weren't we there last week?

69
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:54,733
That was Jostalica.

70
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,695
-Come on, man. Try to concentrate, please.
-Easy.

71
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:00,864
I'm a professional.

72
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,701
The Dampyr.

73
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,750
Come closer. Please. Come closer.

74
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,836
The Dampyr is coming.

75
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:20,425
The Dampyr.

76
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,761
Citizens of Jostanira.

77
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,931
I know you're all worried.

78
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,976
Evil has reached your peaceful village.

79
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,938
And believe me when I tell you,
you are right to be afraid.

80
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,484
The devil's stench is everywhere,
infesting this place.

81
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,695
You are damned.

82
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,701
You heard me, you are damned
and you already know it.

83
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,705
But from now on, you will fear no evil.

84
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,623
Because today...

85
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:57,963
finally, here in your midst
stands the powerful...

86
00:13:58,797 --> 00:13:59,882
Harlan...

87
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,634
the Dampyr.

88
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,469
The Dampyr.

89
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,182
Take me to the cemetery.

90
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,059
Get back. Give him room to work.

91
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,984
Get back. The Dampyr feels
the presence of a vampire.

92
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:24,823
Get back.

93
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,494
Out, damned soul.

94
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,331
Return to the hell that spawned you.

95
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,791
You don't belong in this holy place.

96
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,511
-Margherita pizza...
-What is he saying?

97
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:50,599
Esoteric formulas to seal the cemetery
and make it impossible for evil to return.

98
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,019
God, I could use a fucking drink
right now, Yuri.

99
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,148
Millennial knowledge.

100
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,326
Return to your homes in peace.

101
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,496
The monster that infected your cemetery
has been defeated.

102
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,720
Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.

103
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,850
Okay. Okay. Thank you. Oh, thank you.

104
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:34,893
Yuri!

105
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,576
Commander Kurjak to command.

106
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,621
Commander Kurjak to command.

107
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,584
Commander Kurjak.

108
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,340
Commander Kur--

109
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,095
Fuck it.

110
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:17,519
Now what?

111
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:21,607
We stay here...

112
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,320
and maintain our position.

113
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,139
I don't get Kurjak.

114
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,893
What is the point
of staying in this town, huh?

115
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,188
This ghost town will help us win the war?

116
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:05,359
Since when did you become
a strategist, Petar?

117
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,653
Hey. Isn't that what I'm here for?

118
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,322
You're here because you have smokes.
Give me one.

119
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,033
Maybe it will stop me
freezing my nuts off.

120
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,377
Help!

121
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,507
I gotta be dreaming.

122
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,134
Oh, you're not dreaming.

123
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,219
Help!

124
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,933
-Help me, I'm scared.
-Sure, baby.

125
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,393
I'll help you.

126
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:41,687
Come to Daddy.

127
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,314
Wait, Petar. You don't know
who the fuck she might be.

128
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,652
All right.
It looks like she's dying to know me.

129
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,445
Petar.

130
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,451
Help.

131
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,175
Petar.

132
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:13,927
Petar.

133
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:17,681
Petar!

134
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:26,982
Move!

135
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,819
Commander!

136
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,155
Who's shooting?

137
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,284
Came from down there where
those two idiots, Petar and Janko, are.

138
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,496
-We're under attack!
-Move. Three with me!

139
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:43,415
Move!

140
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:07,523
Who's there?

141
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:15,822
Tito!

142
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:17,366
Tito!

143
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:42,057
-Move.
-Commander. We are under attack!

144
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,975
Commander!

145
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:44,852
Who attacked us?

146
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,406
Hey!

147
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,994
Hold your positions!

148
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,329
Hold!

149
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:05,914
What's going on?

150
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,041
What's going on?

151
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,178
Son of a bitch.

152
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,224
Commander!

153
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:25,976
Commander, we need help!

154
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,102
Come on!

155
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:28,562
Cover!

156
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,565
Get him down. Move.

157
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:39,364
Who did you see, Josif?

158
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,577
I shot him, but he didn't die.

159
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,246
He didn't die.

160
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,708
Josif. Josif!

161
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,335
Don't do that.

162
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:54,463
We have to call him.

163
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,132
Come on, asshole.

164
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,385
-The old man was right!
-Lazar.

165
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:01,929
Our enemies...

166
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,805
hellish creatures!

167
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:06,183
Undead!

168
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,812
-What is wrong with you?
-Our bullets are useless against them.

169
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,858
We have to find the one
who know how to beat them.

170
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,444
Who the fuck are you talking about?

171
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:22,449
I know him.

172
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,620
Let me go look for the one...

173
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:29,248
who can help us.

174
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,595
I hate it
when I have to do the whole show.

175
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,763
We're doing nothing wrong.

176
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,641
-You call this "doing nothing wrong"?
-The girl is already dead.

177
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:48,892
She won't feel a thing.

178
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,896
And her parents can go to sleep tonight,
knowing she won't wake up as a vampire.

179
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:56,483
That, in my opinion,
is what is called "doing good."

180
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,986
And it's all thanks to the great Dampyr.

181
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,490
Just give me the goddamn stake.

182
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:10,622
Save us.

183
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,165
-You're our savior.
-Dampyr.

184
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:13,375
Dampyr.

185
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:32,186
-Get back.
-Do you have to cut off her head?

186
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:35,814
She's my youngest daughter, Emina.

187
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,483
Save her soul, Dampyr.

188
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,611
Hey, let the Dampyr work, okay?

189
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:41,695
Please!

190
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,283
Forgive me, Emina.

191
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,544
Oh, my God.

192
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:06,803
Thanks. Thanks, but--

193
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,473
Thanks, but please keep quiet.

194
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,684
We are purifying the cemetery
of its evil spirits,

195
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:15,062
of which there are so many
at this time of death.

196
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,522
Thank you, thanks.

197
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:17,814
Show is over, kid.

198
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:19,691
You have to come with us.

199
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,696
We're arresting this fraud on orders
from our commander.

200
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:27,533
He won't be able
to fleece you suckers anymore.

201
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,243
Stay back!

202
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:30,661
Stay back!

203
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:32,955
Stay back!

204
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,542
If you arrest him,
then you have to arrest me too.

205
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,668
Beat it, kid!

206
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,672
-Down, boy.
-Not going anywhere without my manager!

207
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:58,689
I didn't recognize you.
Otherwise, I would have hit you harder.

208
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,108
You haven't changed a bit
since the day we met.

209
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,151
The advantages of living a healthy life.

210
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:07,030
You, on the other hand, look like shit.
The war does not agree with you.

211
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:09,366
You can't arrest us
for giving people hope.

212
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,702
"Hope." Too bad for those stupid fucks.

213
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,037
And we're not arresting you.

214
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,248
Our commander wants to talk to you.

215
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:17,791
Talk to us?

216
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:22,087
-What? Two useless, meaningless bums?
-Yeah, you're right, kid.

217
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,465
The truth is,
it's Harlan he wants to talk to.

218
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,259
What the fuck am I gonna tell him?

219
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:29,803
What's really going on here, Lazar?

220
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:03,253
Move.

221
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:08,133
Let's go.

222
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:11,553
Open up!

223
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:14,431
Hey, I'm his manager.

224
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:16,350
Butt out, kid.

225
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:25,943
Here he is, commander.

226
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:39,581
Well?

227
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:46,213
"Well," what?
You're the ones that brought me here.

228
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:48,966
I was better off
not seeing your ugly faces.

229
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,261
Show Commander Kurjak some respect.

230
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:55,889
Yes, sir, colonel.

231
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:58,433
Private Harlan reporting for duty.

232
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:03,522
No?

233
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,735
If we've finished with the introductions,
can someone tell me what I'm doing here?

234
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,280
I got nothing to do with this war.

235
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:16,827
Sit.

236
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:21,623
Please.

237
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:49,359
This war involves us all.

238
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:52,279
You too, Dampyr.

239
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,331
Something attacked us last night.

240
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,626
Killed my men.

241
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,713
Something not of this world.

242
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:13,884
I want to know what.

243
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:17,513
And they tell me that you know.

244
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,853
What exactly are you?

245
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:27,314
Me?

246
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:32,110
I'm a Dampyr.

247
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:35,072
A vampire hunter.

248
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,369
Me and my partner,
we go around making sure anyone bitten

249
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:43,539
by those hellish creatures
doesn't come back to life.

250
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,459
Then you know how to kill them.

251
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:49,795
Yeah.

252
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:55,467
But you really wanna know what I am?

253
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:01,598
I'm full of shit.

254
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,645
Vampires don't exist, you fucking fool.

255
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,373
Get him up.

256
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,584
I'm his manager. I have to be with him.

257
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,627
He has the right
to have someone defend him.

258
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:32,629
Hey. Harlan!

259
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,133
Harlan. You wanna tell me
what you did to my partner?

260
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:39,136
Here he is, all in one piece. For now.

261
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:49,855
Take a good fucking look.

262
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:55,068
I don't know who or what did this,
but the same could happen to you tonight.

263
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:56,653
Are you fucking crazy?

264
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:58,614
The Dampyr is bullshit!

265
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,073
Hey, leave him.

266
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:05,787
He's only saying that
just to save his own skin.

267
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,833
But we come from the same town
and we all know what he really is.

268
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,378
The son of the devil.

269
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:17,633
The proof is in the fact
that he hasn't aged a bit

270
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,092
since I first met him.

271
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:24,056
Let's see which of you
is telling the truth.

272
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,017
Lazar, give him your gun.

273
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:29,645
Move!

274
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,944
It's fully loaded.

275
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,363
Don't waste it.

276
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:45,536
Load up!

277
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:52,918
-You're gonna get him killed.
-Hey, we gave him a gun.

278
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:56,463
Your friend is the goat
to attract the wolf.

279
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:58,173
If he's what they say,

280
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,260
he's the wolf, not the goat.

281
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,724
Let's see how this plays out.

282
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,497
What a shitty night.

283
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:40,817
Help.

284
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:45,239
Hey.

285
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,243
-Hey, it's okay.
-Please don't hurt me.

286
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:51,036
What you doing in here?

287
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:54,164
I'm just trying to stay alive.

288
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:56,875
It's okay.

289
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:58,669
Please.

290
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:11,849
Hey, hey, hey.

291
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,477
Hey.

292
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:28,282
The smell of your blood.

293
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,827
-What are you?
-What--? What am I?

294
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,412
What the fuck are you?

295
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:46,633
On your feet, handsome.

296
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:47,718
Time for dinner.

297
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:54,850
Harlan?

298
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:58,228
-We need to see what's happened to him.
-No one leaves.

299
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,951
What have you got against my T-shirt?

300
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:16,580
-Now I'm gonna ruin yours.
-No, Bojan, no!

301
00:33:35,641 --> 00:33:36,975
He isn't human.

302
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:39,603
How the fuck did you do that?

303
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,201
Move!

304
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:57,412
Fire!

305
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:27,317
Kill him. Kill him! Kill him!

306
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:00,851
The Dampyr.

307
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:02,978
Dampyr.

308
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:38,180
Come back here, my children,
you cannot defeat him.

309
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:40,599
Not you.

310
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:45,854
You stay.

311
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,734
Stay with him and be my eyes.

312
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:27,729
He's still alive!

313
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:45,163
I thought I was gonna lose you.

314
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:51,086
Oh, my God, are you okay?

315
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:52,588
Yeah.

316
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:12,649
Kurjak, let's get the hell out
of this damn place.

317
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,526
If we stay here, we all die.

318
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,278
Yeah, they'll kill us all.

319
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:26,830
What the fuck did you do to him?

320
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:29,249
It was the sun.

321
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:32,127
There's a girl inside you should see.

322
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,881
Fuck.

323
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:38,509
Get inside.

324
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:46,975
You scared?

325
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:51,313
Are you fucking scared?

326
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:53,273
Lazar!

327
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:58,654
-Move! Inside!
-Move!

328
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,364
Move!

329
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:22,970
We have a prisoner.

330
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:27,224
Step back!

331
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:32,229
No one leaves.

332
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:39,611
Nothing personal, Kurjak,

333
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:43,740
but they didn't say anything
about fighting vampires when I signed up.

334
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:48,161
You want to face a court martial, Stefan?

335
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:51,331
You brought us
to this shithole of a village

336
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:53,333
to feed us to these monsters.

337
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:57,087
A bunch of our buddies are dead already!

338
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:01,341
Maybe you're the one
who should face a court martial.

339
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:02,301
And you...

340
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:07,389
if you really are a vampire killer,
then waste that thing.

341
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:12,060
Let's drag its ass out into the sun
and burn it like the other one!

342
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,313
Let's kill that mons--

343
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,774
-What the hell are you doing, asshole?
-Makes no sense killing her.

344
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,068
He's right.

345
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:24,448
That's the only thing that can tell us
what the fuck we are up against.

346
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:27,242
Let's leave Kurjak here with that thing.

347
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:29,661
-Right. They can kill each other.
-Fuck, yeah.

348
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:36,335
Let's get the hell out of here!

349
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:37,794
Let's go!

350
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,594
It's crazy to stay here, Emil.

351
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:48,055
Come with us.

352
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:51,183
-Let's cross the--
-I'm no deserter.

353
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:57,564
These things could kill us all...

354
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:00,359
and you want to walk away?

355
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,028
Pretend they don't exist?

356
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:07,115
Hey.

357
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:10,702
What the hell are we doing here
with this crazy soldier

358
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,246
and that monster over there?

359
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:16,625
Yuri, look, you...

360
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:22,381
You can't stay here, okay?

361
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:24,466
What?

362
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:30,389
There are some strange things
happening to me and I need to...

363
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,434
I need to stay here and figure them out.

364
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:37,563
-No, I...
-They'll be back. It's...

365
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:40,983
It's dangerous. It's not safe.

366
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:42,609
I'm not leaving you here.

367
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:46,196
-You gotta go.
-No.

368
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:47,865
No.

369
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:52,911
Harlan.

370
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,623
Take the boy with you.

371
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:58,876
Me and Harlan are a team.

372
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:01,420
Tell them, Harlan.

373
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:03,255
Harlan?

374
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:09,511
Hey, you said
we'd always stick together, you promised.

375
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:10,596
Let's go, kid.

376
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,347
-You promised me, Harlan.
-Let's go.

377
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,475
I thought we were family, Harlan.

378
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:16,602
Please, Harlan.

379
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:19,521
Please. Don't do this to me, Harlan.

380
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:21,565
Let me stay with you, Harlan, please.

381
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:24,276
Come away with us. Please, Harlan.

382
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:27,154
Harlan, please.

383
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,908
-Let go of me!
-Look at it this way, Kurjak.

384
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:35,954
Staying here could be the best way
to get yourself killed...

385
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,081
and see your son again.

386
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:42,211
Run as far as you can, Stefan.

387
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:47,257
Because as soon as command finds out
you're fucking chicken,

388
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,259
they will come for you.

389
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:53,138
Then we'll make sure
you can't tell anyone...

390
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:56,517
commander.

391
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:58,352
Door!

392
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:01,271
Lock them with the monster.

393
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:18,914
Let's go.

394
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:06,253
Fuck!

395
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,884
-How's that working out?
-Shut up.

396
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:14,553
Why?

397
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:17,848
You've got no fucking plan.

398
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:21,268
How about we start getting
some answers from that bitch?

399
00:43:28,817 --> 00:43:29,651
Move.

400
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,154
No.

401
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,781
Move.

402
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:37,284
It's Tesla.

403
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:42,414
Not "bitch."

404
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,835
You defended me before, soldier.

405
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:48,921
And you...

406
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:53,592
Dampyr, you could have killed me,
but I'm still alive.

407
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:56,803
I owe you.

408
00:43:56,887 --> 00:43:58,764
Remember whose side you're on.

409
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:03,310
You saw the hate in her eyes, right?

410
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:05,187
I don't hate you.

411
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:07,981
I hate Gorka.

412
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:13,278
Who's Gorka?

413
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:16,823
My master, Lord of the Night.

414
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:19,243
It's because of him I am what I am.

415
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:22,496
Lord of the what?

416
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:25,832
For a Dampyr, you don't know much, do you?

417
00:44:27,626 --> 00:44:29,670
Unlike us ordinary vampires,

418
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:32,506
Lords of the Night don't fear
the sunlight.

419
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:36,677
Only Lords of the Night have power
to give life to other vampires...

420
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:39,555
and to generate those like you.

421
00:44:39,638 --> 00:44:40,931
What do you mean, like me?

422
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:43,433
-Keep your distance from the beast.
-Shut up!

423
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:46,603
I need to know.

424
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:51,567
If a Lord of the Night mates
with a non-vampire woman,

425
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:53,902
she will give birth to a Dampyr.

426
00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:56,738
-I'm not-- I'm not a--
-Your blood tells a different story.

427
00:44:57,823 --> 00:44:59,241
I never knew my father.

428
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,077
He obviously hid the truth from you
to protect you.

429
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,581
The Lords of the Night kill
those like you at birth.

430
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:07,040
You're way too dangerous.

431
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:10,752
And now, from the moment
you killed one of his slaves,

432
00:45:10,836 --> 00:45:12,504
Gorka knows you exist.

433
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:13,589
Which means what?

434
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:15,674
He'll do anything to exterminate you.

435
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:45,037
Javor.

436
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:46,663
Shit.

437
00:45:53,295 --> 00:45:54,630
What's going on?

438
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:57,591
-Javor?
-What the fuck is happening?

439
00:45:57,674 --> 00:45:58,717
Why did you stop?

440
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:03,722
Javor.

441
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:06,767
Javor! Javor!

442
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:09,394
Javor! Javor!

443
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:37,548
Run, kid! Run!

444
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:51,395
Run, Yuri! Run!

445
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:16,587
Run, Yuri!

446
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:18,714
What's happening?

447
00:47:21,884 --> 00:47:23,927
-The fuck are you doing to him?
-It's him.

448
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:26,805
Gorka.

449
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:30,976
Run!

450
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:38,650
Run, Yuri!

451
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:40,277
Run!

452
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:56,043
Harlan!

453
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:07,179
He's got Yuri.

454
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:10,057
He's got your men.

455
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:16,605
It's my fault.

456
00:48:29,576 --> 00:48:30,744
Can you take me to him?

457
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:33,539
Please.

458
00:48:34,957 --> 00:48:37,793
Yes, bring him here to my slaughterhouse.

459
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:40,671
Our pack was going back to the city.

460
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:44,716
I can help you find him.

461
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:50,013
Why the fuck would you do that?

462
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:54,977
Only a Dampyr can kill
the Lord of the Night.

463
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:57,771
If Gorka dies...

464
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:00,023
I'm free.

465
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:14,162
I don't trust her.

466
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:20,043
She's one of them.
She'll jump us the first chance she gets.

467
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:22,129
No.

468
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:23,380
She's scared of me.

469
00:49:24,006 --> 00:49:25,007
I'll watch her, okay?

470
00:49:25,883 --> 00:49:29,011
First thing we have to do is find a way
out of this fucking church.

471
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,931
Well, that's easy, soldier boy.

472
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:32,783
Nice handbag.

473
00:50:33,867 --> 00:50:35,035
Come on, pretty boy.

474
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:42,125
I see you went shopping too.

475
00:51:18,954 --> 00:51:19,955
Leave it.

476
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:29,381
That mask you're wearing suits you.

477
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:34,720
Don't you know that sunlight is bad
for the skin, soldier boy?

478
00:51:42,895 --> 00:51:43,896
What are you?

479
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:46,982
Mom?

480
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:48,317
Monster! Monster!

481
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,986
You're damned.
And so is your mother, that filthy witch.

482
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:53,155
-My mother isn't a witch!
-Get out of here!

483
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:55,949
The smell of your blood. What are you?

484
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:57,784
-Mom!
-What exactly are you?

485
00:51:57,868 --> 00:51:58,911
Monster! Monster!

486
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:01,288
-What do you mean, like me?
-Mom!

487
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:03,832
What exactly are you?

488
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,502
The son of the devil.

489
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:12,174
Harlan.

490
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:14,301
Come here to me.

491
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:15,677
Be careful, Harlan.

492
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:21,683
What?

493
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,311
What happened?

494
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:26,980
You tell me.

495
00:52:27,773 --> 00:52:29,358
You blacked out in the car.

496
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:33,028
Started babbling like crazy.

497
00:52:34,363 --> 00:52:37,074
Shaking like you were possessed
or something.

498
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:42,788
I've always had nightmares.

499
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:46,041
Now they seem more and more real.

500
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:51,505
Like memories trying to re-emerge.
I-- I don't know.

501
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,384
You must think I'm fucking crazy.

502
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:57,594
What we've been through
would drive anyone crazy.

503
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:06,770
Fuck!

504
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:37,176
Hey, she said
she was going for something to eat.

505
00:53:37,259 --> 00:53:39,511
And we know what her diet consists of.

506
00:53:39,595 --> 00:53:41,763
Her friends could show up at any moment.

507
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:44,057
I don't have any friends.

508
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:48,562
But I can hear you whisper from far away.

509
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,025
Didn't your mother teach you it's rude...

510
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:55,986
to whisper about people
behind their backs?

511
00:53:58,363 --> 00:53:59,489
Soldier boy?

512
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:03,452
Besides, I've seen
the way you fight your war.

513
00:54:04,286 --> 00:54:06,997
Do you think you're better
than those like me?

514
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:14,338
You know nothing of war.

515
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:21,220
Would you two just fucking quit?

516
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:44,535
Your wounds are disappearing.

517
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:48,330
You're just like us.

518
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:53,252
You can't expect Kurjak
to accept it as normal.

519
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:56,880
It's hard for me too.

520
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:01,385
Blood has memories.

521
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:05,472
Believe me, I'd rather forget everything

522
00:55:05,556 --> 00:55:08,267
than live with the memory
of what Gorka forced me to endure.

523
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:12,521
And what he forced me to do.

524
00:55:21,446 --> 00:55:22,281
Tesla...

525
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,451
I'm trusting you.

526
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:33,417
Don't worry.

527
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:54,354
What the...?

528
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:36,438
It gives me such pleasure
to feel the fear pulsating in your veins.

529
00:56:37,356 --> 00:56:41,693
I shall never tire of playing
with your miserable lives,

530
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:44,488
whilst you pray in vain to be spared.

531
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:02,548
How does it feel
to know your life is coming to an end?

532
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:06,510
I have no idea what death feels like.

533
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:10,722
I can sniff a hint of it from your terror.

534
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:16,395
We have always existed,
and we always will,

535
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:20,649
being close to kings and emperors,
led them and killed them.

536
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:24,862
Whatever was necessary
to placate our thirst.

537
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:29,283
Past, present
and future are meaningless to us.

538
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:33,495
Only blood is important.

539
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:37,875
I will unleash you from your fear.

540
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:41,837
And you, faithful dog...

541
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:46,258
will join my army.

542
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,665
Everyone's trying
to get out of this hellhole...

543
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,295
and we're thinking of going in.

544
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:26,465
I know how to get us
around the roadblocks.

545
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:29,885
But once we're in...

546
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,472
once it gets dark...

547
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:37,684
if there really are more like the beast...

548
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:40,979
then this won't do any good.

549
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:54,868
You never know.

550
00:59:12,135 --> 00:59:13,971
Now that the bloodsucker is
more comfortable,

551
00:59:14,096 --> 00:59:15,973
you want to tell me what you have in mind?

552
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,285
You think it'll work?

553
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,745
You're the vampire, Tesla.

554
00:59:38,829 --> 00:59:39,997
What do you think?

555
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:42,708
It could.

556
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:44,668
Could?

557
00:59:46,128 --> 00:59:47,546
Let's fucking see.

558
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:50,549
Well...

559
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:53,635
guess we load them up.

560
00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:56,513
Not just a pretty face, huh?

561
00:59:58,599 --> 00:59:59,474
Here.

562
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:06,857
You want one?

563
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:08,859
Yeah.

564
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:10,903
The beast wants one.

565
01:00:13,864 --> 01:00:15,532
You're dangerous enough without one.

566
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:19,494
You're right, soldier boy.

567
01:00:20,913 --> 01:00:23,207
But if I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

568
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:29,671
But if I enter the city barehanded,
I'm dead meat.

569
01:00:29,755 --> 01:00:33,759
Suits me. I won't have
to watch my back for you anymore.

570
01:00:36,053 --> 01:00:38,764
You know,
you're really starting to piss me off.

571
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:43,685
Tesla! Just... let him go.

572
01:00:48,607 --> 01:00:52,903
How about we see
if these new bullets work, huh, Harlan?

573
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:54,112
Go ahead.

574
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:55,697
Shoot.

575
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,116
It'd only be a liberation for me.

576
01:00:59,826 --> 01:01:03,330
Your war is child's play
compared to what I've been through.

577
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:06,041
So do me a favor, soldier boy,

578
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:09,294
cut your macho-man bullshit.

579
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:17,010
Hey.

580
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,151
Tesla...

581
01:01:36,154 --> 01:01:37,781
you know I could have shot you, right?

582
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:40,659
I know.

583
01:01:43,912 --> 01:01:44,913
But you didn't.

584
01:01:47,249 --> 01:01:49,168
Because you know what it means
to be different.

585
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:57,092
Be careful.

586
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,761
It's my blood.

587
01:02:08,729 --> 01:02:10,189
Let's move, lovebirds.

588
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:46,702
I've done my bit.

589
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:50,163
Now it's the bloodsucker's turn.

590
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:54,668
Gorka's lair is under the old library.
We need to walk through this--

591
01:03:57,296 --> 01:03:58,130
Move!

592
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:12,102
Come on.

593
01:04:19,776 --> 01:04:20,819
Dad! Dad, wait!

594
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:22,696
Naya, come on!

595
01:04:23,822 --> 01:04:25,073
Hurry up, hurry up!

596
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:27,075
They're coming.

597
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:31,413
-Let's go, let's go!
-Let's go, they're coming!

598
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:34,499
Let's go, let's go!

599
01:04:37,794 --> 01:04:40,881
-What is it?
-It's better to avoid the busier streets.

600
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:42,424
Come on.

601
01:04:43,258 --> 01:04:44,259
Follow me.

602
01:04:45,177 --> 01:04:46,261
Something's wrong.

603
01:04:46,887 --> 01:04:47,763
Tesla!

604
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:04,321
We've been walking for hours.

605
01:05:05,656 --> 01:05:07,950
I think the bitch walked us
into a fucking trap.

606
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,035
I can't get you to him.

607
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:11,954
Gorka set it up.

608
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:14,998
-He knows we're coming.
-You warned him.

609
01:05:15,082 --> 01:05:16,083
I didn't have to.

610
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:18,293
Lords of the Night know everything,
you can't hide from them.

611
01:05:18,377 --> 01:05:19,795
You fucking warned him!

612
01:05:25,217 --> 01:05:26,051
They're here.

613
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:37,813
Son of a bitch.

614
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:47,990
Fuck!

615
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:52,286
Move!

616
01:06:04,423 --> 01:06:06,216
Stop, you bastards!

617
01:06:29,948 --> 01:06:32,326
It fucking works! I told you it would.

618
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:23,585
Our new master...

619
01:07:24,378 --> 01:07:26,505
wants you dead,

620
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,632
you son of a witch.

621
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:40,602
Told you war was bad for you,
you little shit.

622
01:07:56,243 --> 01:07:57,119
Fuck you!

623
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:19,725
Need some help there, old man?

624
01:08:21,768 --> 01:08:22,561
Fuck you.

625
01:08:24,062 --> 01:08:24,938
Come on.

626
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:28,942
There we go.

627
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:40,287
The only one I wanted to kill was Stefan.

628
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:41,246
I know.

629
01:08:42,456 --> 01:08:43,290
Wait!

630
01:08:48,337 --> 01:08:49,338
Fuck this.

631
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:52,007
It's okay.

632
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:53,550
Harlan.

633
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:02,768
It's Gorka.

634
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:06,563
He's making me do this.

635
01:09:14,947 --> 01:09:16,281
You can fight him, Tesla.

636
01:09:19,243 --> 01:09:20,244
You're wrong.

637
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:22,996
He's too strong.

638
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:26,708
Move out of the fucking way.

639
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:39,638
You are not his slave.

640
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:41,890
I can't help it.

641
01:09:43,308 --> 01:09:44,142
Move.

642
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:45,978
Kill me.

643
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:49,982
Please kill me. Please kill me.

644
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:52,359
Fuck it!

645
01:09:54,278 --> 01:09:55,529
I'm sorry.

646
01:09:55,612 --> 01:09:56,780
Harlan!

647
01:09:56,864 --> 01:09:58,156
Hey. Come.

648
01:09:58,866 --> 01:09:59,658
Come.

649
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:01,785
Fuck.

650
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:07,499
Okay. Clean the wound.

651
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,169
-It is going to sting.
-Okay.

652
01:10:10,252 --> 01:10:11,378
-Ready?
-Yeah.

653
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:18,969
There we go.

654
01:10:19,052 --> 01:10:20,637
Okay, okay.

655
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:23,515
-Drink.
-Yeah.

656
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:25,934
That's it.

657
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:27,811
You're gonna be okay.

658
01:10:31,315 --> 01:10:32,774
-Brave boy.
-Yeah.

659
01:10:44,286 --> 01:10:45,621
That photo in your pocket...

660
01:10:49,082 --> 01:10:50,542
it was your wife and son, right?

661
01:10:55,214 --> 01:10:57,674
Miklos and Miljiana.

662
01:11:06,183 --> 01:11:09,394
Miklos was 9 when he was killed.

663
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,732
I'm sorry.

664
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:17,110
This is war.

665
01:11:29,456 --> 01:11:30,707
Keep the pressure on.

666
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:42,344
From the moment you're born...

667
01:11:44,179 --> 01:11:46,849
they tell you
that their way is the right way.

668
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:53,647
They teach you to the point that
not only do you believe it yourself...

669
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:57,442
but in the end...

670
01:11:59,152 --> 01:12:01,572
it becomes you who teaches it to others.

671
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:05,409
To command it, even.

672
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:08,912
Maybe there is no right team.

673
01:12:13,876 --> 01:12:15,961
Maybe we're all destined
to be on the wrong side.

674
01:12:18,797 --> 01:12:23,218
Or maybe this is the only war
that deserves to be fought.

675
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:35,415
Please, don't!

676
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:05,529
You can't rebel.

677
01:14:06,196 --> 01:14:08,031
We belong to the same master.

678
01:14:24,715 --> 01:14:26,175
I belong to no one.

679
01:14:39,396 --> 01:14:40,397
It's okay.

680
01:14:52,492 --> 01:14:54,953
Love is so overestimated.

681
01:14:57,164 --> 01:14:58,665
I prefer fear.

682
01:15:03,337 --> 01:15:05,881
And you are scared now, Tesla.

683
01:15:07,466 --> 01:15:10,427
Because you know, like a dog,

684
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:12,930
you have bitten the hand that feeds you.

685
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:38,372
A vampire and a Dampyr.

686
01:15:40,499 --> 01:15:42,459
Don't you see the irony of that?

687
01:15:43,627 --> 01:15:46,338
You are insignificant!

688
01:15:55,514 --> 01:15:58,475
A puppet who only moves
when I pull the strings.

689
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:01,395
My property.

690
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,022
And mine alone.

691
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:07,985
The Dampyr will find you...

692
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:13,991
and he will kill you.

693
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:19,329
I want him to find me.

694
01:16:20,414 --> 01:16:26,962
And then I will remedy the mistake
they made in allowing him to live.

695
01:16:45,355 --> 01:16:46,648
You're not much of a nurse.

696
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:49,651
Is this how you watch over the dying?

697
01:16:49,735 --> 01:16:52,613
You got a death wish? No?

698
01:16:57,451 --> 01:17:00,495
Nice to see that when you were
patching me up, you took more of my blood.

699
01:17:06,293 --> 01:17:07,377
Let me see the wound.

700
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:12,883
Shit.

701
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:16,011
-And it doesn't hurt.
-Never seen anything like it.

702
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:23,060
I partnered up
with a fucking superhero, huh?

703
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:23,977
Yeah.

704
01:17:27,731 --> 01:17:29,107
Or maybe a monster.

705
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:47,417
This looks like the place.

706
01:17:50,629 --> 01:17:52,297
What now, pretty boy?

707
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:54,424
Go in,

708
01:17:55,092 --> 01:17:56,218
kill Gorka,

709
01:17:57,344 --> 01:17:58,345
free Yuri.

710
01:17:59,638 --> 01:18:00,639
Simple.

711
01:18:01,849 --> 01:18:02,850
Simple.

712
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:24,413
It's quiet.

713
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:26,498
Too quiet.

714
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:30,919
Let's meet upstairs.

715
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:14,421
Daddy?

716
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:17,007
Miklos?

717
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:20,636
Daddy?

718
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:24,598
Fucking hell!

719
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:27,643
Daddy...

720
01:19:28,852 --> 01:19:30,187
why did you leave me?

721
01:19:33,524 --> 01:19:34,775
Why did you leave me?

722
01:19:37,945 --> 01:19:39,363
Why did you leave me?

723
01:19:58,757 --> 01:19:59,758
Kurjak?

724
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:33,727
Tesla?

725
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:38,899
Tesla.

726
01:21:54,206 --> 01:21:55,832
Have a good nap...

727
01:21:57,209 --> 01:21:58,210
commander?

728
01:22:14,893 --> 01:22:15,727
Leave her.

729
01:22:18,564 --> 01:22:19,356
Leave her!

730
01:22:21,316 --> 01:22:22,776
Fucking leave her!

731
01:22:27,364 --> 01:22:28,365
Stop!

732
01:22:45,424 --> 01:22:46,884
You fucking piece of shit.

733
01:22:52,306 --> 01:22:53,599
Stop!

734
01:23:07,237 --> 01:23:10,991
I've always despised you, Kurjak.

735
01:23:13,076 --> 01:23:18,457
You and your obsession with rules.

736
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:23,253
Your fucking sense of honor.

737
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:49,446
They might have turned you
into a monster, Stefan...

738
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:54,117
but one thing will never change.

739
01:23:57,663 --> 01:23:59,498
You're still a fucking pussy.

740
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:07,376
Gorka!

741
01:26:12,005 --> 01:26:13,006
Yuri!

742
01:26:30,941 --> 01:26:33,485
I've been expecting you, Dampyr.

743
01:26:39,825 --> 01:26:41,159
You're too slow.

744
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:46,164
And now,

745
01:26:46,957 --> 01:26:48,375
in my kingdom,

746
01:26:49,251 --> 01:26:50,961
I can finally kill you.

747
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:03,515
You can try it, you fucking monster.

748
01:27:04,558 --> 01:27:05,559
Monster?

749
01:27:08,061 --> 01:27:08,896
Me?

750
01:27:12,191 --> 01:27:15,152
You're the only abomination here.

751
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:24,661
Now that I have you in front of me,

752
01:27:25,704 --> 01:27:31,210
your stink confirms
what I have always suspected.

753
01:27:33,086 --> 01:27:35,672
You belong to Draka's lineage.

754
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:38,509
Draka was a fool.

755
01:27:38,592 --> 01:27:43,805
He should never have let you
into this world or live so long.

756
01:27:44,515 --> 01:27:48,435
And if he wanted to use you
solely for revenge...

757
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:51,730
then he miscalculated.

758
01:27:53,524 --> 01:27:57,861
Just as I drove him from here
centuries ago...

759
01:27:59,196 --> 01:28:02,741
now I will kill you.

760
01:28:04,034 --> 01:28:07,496
Blood of his blood...

761
01:28:09,373 --> 01:28:11,834
how dare you live so long?

762
01:28:19,383 --> 01:28:20,759
Impressive.

763
01:28:21,385 --> 01:28:23,554
Don't you think it's sublime...

764
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:34,231
the futility of all this?

765
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:57,296
No, don't faint yet.

766
01:28:58,547 --> 01:29:01,717
I have someone who wants
to say goodbye to you.

767
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:09,057
A special friend.

768
01:29:22,946 --> 01:29:23,739
Harlan?

769
01:29:27,451 --> 01:29:28,452
Yu-- Yuri.

770
01:29:37,085 --> 01:29:38,545
Yuri, forgive me.

771
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:42,799
For what? I knew you'd come for me.

772
01:29:49,473 --> 01:29:51,350
Unfortunately, it's too late.

773
01:29:55,145 --> 01:29:55,979
Yuri.

774
01:29:58,607 --> 01:29:59,650
No!

775
01:30:15,499 --> 01:30:17,084
I'm sorry, old friend.

776
01:30:18,544 --> 01:30:20,128
Gorka is my master now.

777
01:30:29,721 --> 01:30:33,475
I couldn't stop him. He was in my head.

778
01:30:36,395 --> 01:30:37,271
I know.

779
01:30:42,776 --> 01:30:46,446
I don't wanna live like this.
Please, Harlan.

780
01:30:55,247 --> 01:30:56,623
It's okay, Yuri.

781
01:30:57,791 --> 01:30:58,792
I'm here.

782
01:31:02,713 --> 01:31:04,464
You're a true Dampyr, my friend.

783
01:31:06,425 --> 01:31:10,304
It was great... working with you.

784
01:31:40,959 --> 01:31:43,879
What a heartbreaking farewell.

785
01:32:27,965 --> 01:32:30,300
The soldier and the traitor.

786
01:32:31,385 --> 01:32:32,803
You fucking bastard.

787
01:32:43,981 --> 01:32:45,941
You will remain buried here...

788
01:32:46,692 --> 01:32:49,820
drenched in the suffering
these walls have seen.

789
01:32:51,530 --> 01:32:54,408
And you will live
that suffering for eternity...

790
01:32:55,284 --> 01:32:59,496
with every fiber of your being.

791
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,572
It's time to choose, Harlan.

792
01:33:39,912 --> 01:33:40,913
I must know.

793
01:34:11,568 --> 01:34:14,488
Harlan. Come.

794
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:18,116
Come here to me.

795
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:33,632
What is wrong, Harlan?

796
01:34:36,635 --> 01:34:38,804
Are you afraid of your own father?

797
01:34:43,058 --> 01:34:47,104
Or should I perhaps be afraid of my son?

798
01:34:50,482 --> 01:34:53,026
Listen to your blood, my son.

799
01:34:55,654 --> 01:34:57,698
Listen to who you are.

800
01:36:57,276 --> 01:36:59,736
Why did Draka let you live, Dampyr?

801
01:37:00,529 --> 01:37:01,363
Why?

802
01:37:24,928 --> 01:37:30,267
I have lived like a god amongst creatures
that are destined to die.

803
01:37:33,061 --> 01:37:34,980
But because of you, Dampyr...

804
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:38,108
now I know...

805
01:37:40,694 --> 01:37:42,696
the brilliant glare...

806
01:37:45,699 --> 01:37:46,825
of death.

807
01:38:30,786 --> 01:38:31,954
You fought well, soldier.

808
01:38:55,352 --> 01:38:56,186
Come on.

809
01:39:42,441 --> 01:39:43,692
What is this place?

810
01:39:44,985 --> 01:39:47,279
This can't have anything to do with Gorka.

811
01:39:48,739 --> 01:39:50,824
Gorka said it once belonged to my father.

812
01:40:16,433 --> 01:40:17,559
This is my father.

813
01:40:19,019 --> 01:40:20,646
That's how I see him in my visions.

814
01:40:21,813 --> 01:40:24,149
I guess ugly runs in the family, then.

815
01:40:44,002 --> 01:40:45,921
There are many others like him.

816
01:40:47,297 --> 01:40:49,675
Then it's going to be a long war.

817
01:40:51,009 --> 01:40:53,136
Welcome to the world of nightmares,
soldier boy.

818
01:40:55,472 --> 01:40:57,099
We're gonna become their nightmare.

819
01:41:51,528 --> 01:41:54,364
Our son has made his choice, Velma.

820
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,244
He has become...

821
01:42:00,412 --> 01:42:01,496
the Dampyr.

822
01:42:02,539 --> 01:42:05,584
But he didn't agree to follow you.

823
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:08,337
Nor to become your ally.

824
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:10,923
He might try to kill you.

825
01:42:13,008 --> 01:42:14,009
Perhaps.

826
01:42:15,427 --> 01:42:16,428
Or...

827
01:42:17,554 --> 01:42:20,349
perhaps he will heed
the call of his blood.

828
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:25,312
My blood.

829
01:42:32,778 --> 01:42:34,363
For this is only the beginning.

830
01:42:37,366 --> 01:42:39,535
The beginning of my war.
