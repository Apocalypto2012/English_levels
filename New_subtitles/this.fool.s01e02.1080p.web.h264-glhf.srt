1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,522
Does no one respect

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,298
your busted-ass ride?

3
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:10,302
Call Rent Your Rims
so your wheels could have some drift.

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:14,640
Coming up next is another
throwback classic from back in the day.

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,745
Ooh! Damn!

6
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,080
Yeah, I love this jam, homey.

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,458
Oh! I can't believe
they're calling this a throwback.

8
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,360
- It's an oldie.
- You fools are oldies now.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,821
Tsk. You're the oldie
with your ancient Mayan face, like...

10
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,448
Old Benjamin Button face-ass.

11
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,827
I'm still young and delicious.
I'm like a cupcake.

12
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,414
Damn, I haven't felt this good in years.

13
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,042
You know, this Hugs not Thugs shit
ain't that bad.

14
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,944
I actually like making cupcakes,
you know, it's therapeutic.

15
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,256
Sorry I gave you
a hard time at first, primo.

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,442
Thanks for getting me on the program.

17
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,819
Don't even mention it.

18
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,529
We're family.

19
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:53,554
I got your back.

20
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,473
Damn, y'all corny.

21
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,143
Let's drop off these cupcakes, man.

22
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,899
Hey, Julio!

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,730
You gonna help us out or...

24
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,231
What the fuck are you doing?

25
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,465
You never heard of it?

26
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,008
It's this new thing called a stretching.

27
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,969
What are you, the fuckin' elderly?

28
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,345
You need a Viagra?

29
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,138
Probably not right now
'cause we're at work but maybe later, huh?

30
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,890
Hey. Hey.

31
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,351
Y'all hurry the fuck up and decide
whether your dicks is old or not

32
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,210
so y'all can help me
deliver these cupcakes.

33
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,213
Shit. Y'all talk more than
the motherfuckin' View.

34
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,429
Look at this bitch made motherfucker.

35
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,098
Davonte.

36
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,827
Thought your ass
would be dead by now.

37
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,412
On the contrary, bitch.

38
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,063
As you can see, I'm alive and thriving.

39
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,460
So you one of them
pink cupcake bitches now, huh?

40
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,796
Hey, playboy. We're called Huggers.

41
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,047
Hey, hey, Julio.

42
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,966
- I got this shit.
- Shit.

43
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,427
You even more bitch than I remember.

44
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,180
And you was always quite the bitch.

45
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,432
Hey, remember
that time me and my boys

46
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,142
beat your ass
outside your grandma's house?

47
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,352
You must have
Alzheimer's, homeboy.

48
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,604
It was outside Magic Mountain.

49
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,606
It was me and my boys who beat your ass.

50
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,316
Dawg, that would have never happened!

51
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,151
Black people don't fuck
with Magic Mountain.

52
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,111
We Knott's Berry Farm people, fool.

53
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,198
- Nah, nah, nah. You forgot.
- Your ass was at Magic Mountain.

54
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,824
Maybe a sock to the face
will remind your ass, huh?

55
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,141
Hey, hey, hey!

56
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,119
Enough of this shit.

57
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,038
We got cupcakes to deliver.

58
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,731
At least your old boys used to be tough.

59
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,193
Now you roll around
with soft motherfuckers like this bitch.

60
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,840
Look at him. He got "rob me" face
and fucked-up teeth.

61
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,258
Couldn't fight if he wanted to.

62
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,117
- Man, fuck you!
- Hey, hey!

63
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,596
We're gonna handle this shit,
we're gonna do it right.

64
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,139
Imma gather my boys, you gather yours.

65
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,724
I'll meet you at the park at sunset.

66
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:45,850
Throw some putasos.

67
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,685
Oh, yeah, me and my boys will be there.

68
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,356
But be warned,
my boys ain't boys anymore, they're men.

69
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,732
Yeah, my boys are soldiers.

70
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,216
Well, my boys are warriors.

71
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,347
Bitch-ass mark.

72
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,309
Why'd you flinch?

73
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,604
Stop flinching!

74
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,232
Fuck!

75
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,852
Damn, I can't wait to see my boys.

76
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,544
Haven't seen those fools in forever.

77
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,148
You're for real gonna go
fight in the park?

78
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,381
Like you're in junior high?

79
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,443
Hey, if you're not down,
I'll go fuckin' do it myself.

80
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,070
Guess you were lying
when you said all the shit about family

81
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,512
and always having my back, huh?

82
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,599
Goddamn it. Fine.

83
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,536
I'll drive you.
But I'm not fuckin' fighting.

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,788
I don't want
you to throw down anyway.

85
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,248
I ain't trying to lose.

86
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,332
Man, fuck you.

87
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,168
Goddamn, you bitches ain't finished yet?

88
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,753
Hurry the fuck up so I can get home
in time for Judge Mathis.

89
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,673
Dawg, you gotta get
on that Judge Judy train,

90
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,924
that bitch is mean.

91
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,510
- Nah, nah, nah, nah. Fuck that.
- I only support black judges.

92
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,887
Except for Clarence Thomas.

93
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,805
I hope that bitch dies.

94
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:06,955
Hey, hey, hey, chef.

95
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,143
You wanna help us
go fight some fools at the park?

96
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,227
No, no, no, no, no.

97
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,397
See that goes against every single thing
that I've worked so hard to achieve.

98
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,174
Oh, come on, dawg, please!

99
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,612
A'ight, fuck it. You've convinced me.

100
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:21,863
Yeah!

101
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,323
Come on, now.

102
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,699
Yeah, we got seven more trays to go, man.

103
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,016
We've been here how long?

104
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,915
A'ight, so who we about to go fight?

105
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,250
One of my old enemies
from back in the day.

106
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,943
Some bitch-ass fool named Davonte.

107
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,631
Well, wait, there's a Hispanic dude
out there named Davonte?

108
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,031
Nah, nah, nah, nah. He's Black.

109
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,468
Oh, fuck that.

110
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,637
I'm not gonna help two Mexicans
beat up a Black dude.

111
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,347
Look, I'll still roll with you,

112
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,307
but when we fight,
I'm gonna have to fight on his side.

113
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,100
Okay, I can respect that.

114
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,936
- You've gotta back up your people.
- Yeah.

115
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,003
When the fight comes,
you could take Julio.

116
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:56,940
Hell, yeah!

117
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,691
I've been meaning to fuck you up.

118
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,443
But we work together.

119
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,510
Exactly.

120
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,489
Alright, the first homey
we're gonna pick up, pff,

121
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,700
it's my ride or die homey,
my A1 since day one.

122
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,476
The boy to end all boys.

123
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,051
You're all stretched out now.

124
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,115
- Stop fighting, stop fighting.
- Cut that shit out.

125
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,539
Hey, what's up, Vero?

126
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,351
Um, we're actually here to see Fat ass.

127
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,270
Hey, Luis.

128
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,378
It's been too long.

129
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,173
That's so nice
that you decided to stop by.

130
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,175
Come on in.

131
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:42,926
Come on.

132
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,440
My boy.

133
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,380
These were his favorites.

134
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,903
Mm. I like your style.

135
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,512
Quick and easy.

136
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,433
Man, can't believe he died.

137
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:33,912
Really?

138
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,812
I mean, his name was Fat ass.

139
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,874
What you trying to say?

140
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,877
You don't exactly meet
a lot of old fools named Fat ass.

141
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,713
Obesity does account
for 18% of all male deaths

142
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,797
over the age of 40.

143
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,365
Excuse me.

144
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:50,452
But my husband's weight
had nothing to do with his passing.

145
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,704
It was a car crash.

146
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,249
Texting and driving.

147
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,644
The silent killer.

148
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,438
- Wow.
- That is a lot to take in, Luis.

149
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,191
I think you should take the day
to process this loss.

150
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,693
I don't think you're in the right space
to fight that fool Davonte.

151
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,094
- Davonte?
- Yeah.

152
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,222
Fat ass hated that motherfucker.

153
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,242
You gotta kick that fool's ass.

154
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,226
I'll be honored to kick his ass.

155
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,062
For Fat ass.

156
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,124
You know, Luis,
right before Fat ass died,

157
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,501
he said something about you.

158
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:22,901
For real? What did he say?

159
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,196
Yeah, he said you owed him $20.

160
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,300
Oh, yeah, uh...

161
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,243
No problem. Give me $20.

162
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,038
You, uh, you think
I could get your number?

163
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,332
Respectfully.

164
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,502
For Fat ass.

165
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,254
Motherfuckers are good.

166
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:51,156
Damn, got some nasty
throat acid or some shit.

167
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,575
That's what you get
for eating all those Bagel Bites.

168
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,309
You probably fucked up your esophagus.

169
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,853
Esopha these nuts.

170
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,063
- Wait. What?
- Shut up.

171
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,483
Luckily, I got a homey
who lives just a few blocks from here.

172
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,403
Assuming he's not dead,
he'll roll with us for sure.

173
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,781
Hey, goddamn.

174
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,970
That shit smell like some cheap-ass
Chef Boyardee shit, man.

175
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,714
Crack the motherfucking window
in this shit.

176
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,436
Man, fuck Davonte, homey.

177
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,296
I'm still banned from Magic Mountain
from that last time we jumped him.

178
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,317
You know I'd love to kick
that fool's ass one last time,

179
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,860
fuck, but I can't, dawg.

180
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,677
My sciatic nerve's
been acting up, homey.

181
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,364
That's bullshit.

182
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,575
Quit making excuses
and come back up your homeboy.

183
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,993
Hey, hold up.

184
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,644
Sciatic nerve pain is no joke.

185
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,497
Where's the problem?

186
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,415
It's in my L4, L5, dawg.

187
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,334
Damn, mine's L5 and S1.

188
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,753
- Damn.
- Wait. Does yours radiate down your leg?

189
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,296
Shit, like a motherfucker, homey.

190
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,589
Oh, shit, I feel you, man.

191
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,633
My spine specialist said
I probably gotta get

192
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,218
one of those microdiscectomies.

193
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,844
- Oh, shit, for real?
- Yeah!

194
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,513
- Man, I'll pray for you.
- Please.

195
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,597
That's rough, homey,

196
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,140
but it might not all be bad news.

197
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,808
My homeboy had that same operation.

198
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,894
He said a couple of months
of physical therapy, he was right back...

199
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,604
Hey, come on, y'all, stay focused!

200
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,774
We're talking about busting heads,
not broken backs and shit.

201
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,401
Damn, my boy. I wish I could join you.

202
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,885
I really can't risk it, dawg.

203
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,113
You know... Hey, do me a solid, homey.

204
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,573
Take my son.

205
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:16,997
He needs to get toughened up, dawg.

206
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,202
Oh, yeah, I forgot you had a morro.

207
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,495
How old is he now?

208
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,039
I don't fucking know, dawg,
like 12 or some shit.

209
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,481
Hey, Junior, come here!

210
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,782
Junior, this is my homeboy Luis.

211
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,828
You ready to get into
a gang fight, Junior?

212
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,348
Like West Side Story?

213
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,498
I'll go get changed.

214
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,752
Fuckin' loves that movie, dawg.

215
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,132
By the way, you still owe me
20 fucking bucks, homes.

216
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,342
Yeah, don't trip on me, I got it.

217
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,686
So are you like the Sharks or the Jets?

218
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,415
Whichever one you want.

219
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,650
Okay. Then we're the Sharks, obviously.

220
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,945
What the fuck are you talking about?

221
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,073
Hey, you good?

222
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,094
My stomach and my throat
are pretty fucked up.

223
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,221
Dawg, you probably got acid reflux.

224
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,098
My dad has acid reflux.

225
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,333
He says that's what happens
when you get old.

226
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,312
Hey, if you're not feeling good,

227
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,938
we should just reschedule the fight.

228
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:29,939
Fuck, no!

229
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,090
This ain't Google Calendars,
this is real life.

230
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,278
We should at least stop by the store
and get you some probiotics.

231
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,488
Those always help me.

232
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:37,739
Alright, alright.

233
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,824
Give me some of those antibiotics
they put up your culo.

234
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,075
It's not how you take them, idiot.

235
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,285
You take them orally.

236
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,703
I'm not taking shit orally.

237
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:44,913
But that's how you take them.

238
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:47,231
Yeah, yeah, that's how
you take them. Ugh!

239
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,210
Did you just say you take a shit orally?

240
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,443
Yo, y'all are nasty.

241
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,821
There's a little boy in this car.

242
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,492
Fuckin' his little brain up.
Mm-hmm-hmm.

243
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,568
Hey, kid.

244
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,353
This is what me and your jefe
used to do all the time back in the day.

245
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,242
You used to steal Tums with my dad?

246
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,118
We used to steal all kinds of shit
from this store.

247
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,787
They got a no chase policy.

248
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:28,456
So once you make it past the exit,
you're untouchable.

249
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,708
Code green on aisle two.

250
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,818
Code green on aisle two.

251
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,302
Here, Julio, help me
sell some of these cupcakes.

252
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,369
I got you.

253
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,558
Boy, oh, boy!

254
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:49,585
These sure are some yummy-ass cupcakes.

255
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,688
And for a great cause?

256
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:52,796
Don't mind if I do.

257
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,091
Cupcakes. Cupcakes.

258
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,512
Bitch, do you want me to relapse?

259
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,991
Do you realize how high
of a motherfucking recidivism rate

260
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,933
I'm up against?
Do you?

261
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,537
Why don't you buy a fuckin' cupcake?

262
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,979
Keep a nigga off the streets.

263
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,566
Thank you.
Red velvet is an amazing choice.

264
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,627
Alright, let's hit these calles.

265
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,153
Wait, you didn't buy anything?

266
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:22,910
Run, bitch.

267
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,059
Hugs Not Thugs is does not condone this,

268
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,293
but the cupcakes are bomb.

269
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,649
Toma! Pssh!

270
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,634
Fuck you, Officer Krupke!

271
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,720
Get in the car!

272
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,537
- Luis, you fuckin' idiot.
- You could have got us arrested.

273
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,956
Hey, his pops wanted me
to toughen him up.

274
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't want the poor kid
to grow up and be like you.

275
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:57,086
I love being in a gang.

276
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,278
Yeah, you fuckin' do.

277
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,923
Hey, mijo, check this out.

278
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,990
Me and your pops used to do this
to freak girls out.

279
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,803
My fuckin' neck!

280
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,972
Fool, this is why you gotta stretch.

281
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,432
Shut up, bitch!

282
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,267
Fuck. I'm fine, alright?

283
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,627
- I'm still down to fight.
- That's the spirit!

284
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:17,464
After all, did Maria give up
after Tony murdered her brother?

285
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,175
No. She dated him.

286
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:23,571
Yo, I don't know what
this little motherfucker talkin' about,

287
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:24,989
man, but it's motivatin'!

288
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,991
Hey, hey, make a left right here, Julio.

289
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,615
We still got plenty more boys to hit up.

290
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,017
I'm tired of hearing this stupid-ass song.

291
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,955
Oh, fuck!

292
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,190
Oh, man, it sounded like
you pinched a nerve.

293
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,501
Dawg, can we quit this shit yet?

294
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,961
This ain't working.

295
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,880
- No, no, no, no.
- I still got one last boy, alright?

296
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,655
This fool used to be down for anything.

297
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,407
He was our wild card.

298
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,643
Damn, he probably
doesn't even live here anymore.

299
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,252
Hmm.

300
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:39,939
Luis?

301
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,566
Hey, I know you probably moved on

302
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,884
and evolved as a person or whatever,

303
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,637
uh, but if you're down,
which I'm sure you're not,

304
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,181
a few of us are gonna go
fuck up that fool Davonte.

305
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,912
Oh, fuck yeah, perro!

306
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,497
I'm down.

307
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,356
I'm tired of this square-ass life.

308
00:14:58,649 --> 00:14:59,816
- Really?
- Yeah.

309
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,587
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey!

310
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,380
Let's kill this motherfucker!

311
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,882
Slow down, perro.

312
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,550
We're just trying to throw some putasos.

313
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,052
Hey, no half measures.

314
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,745
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna fuckin' do right!

315
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,458
- Right. No, no, yeah.
- No, you're right.

316
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,020
Uh, the only thing is, homey,
we forgot our cuetes,

317
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,355
so that's the only problem.

318
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,939
- Oh, don't worry about it.
- I got you fools. How many you need?

319
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,009
Uh... maybe four.

320
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,446
I want a knife.

321
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,471
A knife?

322
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,974
I wanna feel it.

323
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,312
Yeah, homey, so I guess
three cuetes and a filero.

324
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:39,773
And a glass of water.

325
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,192
Coming right up.

326
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,820
We gonna die tonight, my boy!

327
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,673
Yeah.

328
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,591
Honey, I'm going out with the boys.

329
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,616
Don't wait up.

330
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,303
Run, bitch!

331
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,871
Shit!

332
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,333
Hey, wait!

333
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,045
Luis!

334
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,424
You still owe me 20 bucks!

335
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,063
What the...

336
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,628
Hey.

337
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,797
Why the fuck are we back
at Hugs Not Thugs?

338
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,632
Because you fell asleep
like a fucking grandpa

339
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,010
after your psycho-ass boy
almost killed us.

340
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,077
Dawg, enough's enough.

341
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:38,016
I'm sad I didn't
get the fuck you up, Julio.

342
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,042
Shit, man. Until next time, man.

343
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,395
Wa-da-ba-da, boom, boom!

344
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,980
Clink, clink, boy.

345
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,881
I'd have rearranged your whole shit.

346
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:47,966
Yeah.

347
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,052
All my boys abandoned me.

348
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:52,763
I'm all alone in this world.

349
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:54,765
No boys to call my own.

350
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:58,119
Dawg, I'm your boy.

351
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,686
You're not my fuckin' boy.

352
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,689
You're my bitch-ass cousin
who's been complaining all day.

353
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,235
Too scared to throw putasos.

354
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,300
What the fuck?

355
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:15,428
- Fuck you, dawg!
- I'm not your fuckin' boy?

356
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,138
I've been driving you around
all fuckin' day.

357
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,640
I'm doing my best to help you.

358
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:19,724
You're the one being a little bitch.

359
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,184
Let's go throw down.

360
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,728
For what? We're just
gonna get our asses beat.

361
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,797
Then let's go get
our asses beat together, like boys.

362
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:28,775
'Cause you might know
about winning fights,

363
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,027
but I'm an expert
in getting my ass whooped.

364
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,262
You ain't shit in this city
if you haven't beat my ass.

365
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,140
And I'm down 100 bucks,
so now I wanna fuckin' fight.

366
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,065
Damn. You're serious.

367
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:46,900
Goddamn right.

368
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,462
What the fuck?

369
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,029
Are we gonna do this or what?

370
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,701
Let's go.

371
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,329
In the back, Junior.

372
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:11,842
Come on, Luis.

373
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,115
Hey.

374
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,265
They're here.

375
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,393
- So where your boys?
- Where are your boys?

376
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,021
- They were preoccupied.
- I got busy boys.

377
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:52,108
But the boys I did bring
are finna beat your ass.

378
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,652
- You wanna bet?
- Yeah.

379
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,595
Imma do you like Chino did Tony.

380
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,642
- Yeah, let's do this.
- I'll fuck you up, old man.

381
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:03,310
Who are you?

382
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,164
Where am I? What's going on?

383
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,624
We talked about this, Grandpa.

384
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,043
I'm your grandson. You my boy.

385
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:13,070
And I busted you outta that nursing home
so we could whoop on some Mexicans.

386
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,365
What happened to Fat ass?

387
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,912
- He's not with us anymore.
- Damn.

388
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,540
What happened to Bust-a-Nut?

389
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,835
He's in heaven now.

390
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:29,878
With my Uncle Charles.

391
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,274
Texting and driving.

392
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:34,842
It's an epidemic, homey.

393
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,970
- Sorry for your loss.
- Yeah. You too.

394
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,849
So I guess shit's different now, huh?

395
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,746
Hey, I came here for a gang fight.

396
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,148
If we ain't gonna bust heads,
I wanna go home.

397
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,946
Hold up. Look over there.

398
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,284
Ohh!

399
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,047
- Take that motherfucker!
- Get him!

400
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,011
Come on, man!

401
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,639
Yeah, kick his ass.

402
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,058
Come on, come on.

403
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:50,226
Ohh!

404
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,294
