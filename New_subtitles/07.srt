00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,520
"Thanks to the Studio, Author and others for creating this beautiful masterpiece"

2
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:07,870
[Previous episodes]

3
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,910
Surrender all of your monstrous essences.

4
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:12,340
so many people
harassed some students,

5
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,700
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at?

6
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,100
Report.

7
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,579
There's one more chase team.

8
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,550
that Xue Tu killed.

9
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,079
They are interested

10
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,310
to work with me?

11
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,040
¿Fruta Yuling madura?

12
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,110
exploding pearls

13
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,640
even if he could hurt the Ice Monkey King,

14
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,270
but could not kill him.

15
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,400
Add more,

16
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,810
there are still other ice apes.

17
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,480
As long as you can hurt the Ice Monkey King,

18
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,220
the rest leave it to me.

19
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,390
Episode 7

20
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,680
A la Xue Tu.

21
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,310
You...

22
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,480
You can not scape.

23
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,470
¡Argh!

24
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,780
He's been following me for a long time

25
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,350
Aren't you tired?

26
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,610
This place is pretty good.

27
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,860
You guys just rest here.

28
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,120
Xue Tu.

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,750
We have reported your track

30
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,730
to the Third Master.

31
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,430
Obey and surrender.

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,830
¿Oh?

33
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,170
Then,

34
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,840
I have to be more agile.

35
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:18,990
You...

36
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,829
Don't be careless.

37
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,550
Attack him!

38
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,720
Base.

39
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,380
I have to find a way
to get away from them.

40
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,210
Although the members of the Liu Territory are like dogs,

41
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,079
they will be controlled by me this time.

42
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,110
This place is not far
from the Valley of Snows.

43
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,120
You must get the Yuling fruit soon

44
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,540
to treat this [ __ ] wound.

45
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,750
So I can go far.

46
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,150
Was it the Ice Monkey King?

47
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:57,810
Intermediate...

48
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,830
Intermediate level monsters.

49
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,730
Unexpected anesthetic pearl
doesn't work for him

50
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,500
On the contrary, making it even more fierce.

51
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,530
And if

52
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,870
Shall we go back?

53
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,180
We can't run
if he finds out.

54
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,300
Mu Chen.

55
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,370
What do you think?

56
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,700
Are you willing to give up like this?

57
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,600
Of course he is not willing.

58
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,610
I can't go home empty handed.

59
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:37,720
Report.

60
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,980
There is a sign of pursuit.

61
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,350
The safe villain

62
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,790
fled into the Beiling Plains.

63
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,000
Inland Beiling Plains?

64
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,600
there are many there

65
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,300
high level monsters
that is comparable to the level of Shenpo.

66
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,220
if entered,

67
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,290
most likely to die.

68
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,670
Xue Tu really was quite cunning.

69
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,430
He thought we were going to back off.

70
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,920
if he goes into the interior of Beiling Plains?

71
00:05:59,420 --> 00:05:59,980
Correct.

72
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,570
even the bastard

73
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,340
hide In High Level Monster Cave,

74
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,070
we also have to catch him.

75
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,070
Chase!

76
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,630
GOOD!

77
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,450
If you want to get Yuling Fruit
from this monster's hand,

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,090
we have to divide the task.

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,390
Leiyin.

80
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,030
Lin Zhong.

81
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:22,840
MoLing.

82
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,150
You lure him away
from the Yuling fruit tree.

83
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,280
I will look for opportunities to fight him
with explosive pearls.

84
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,410
Hermana Qian's.

85
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,340
You hide.

86
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,550
When the opportunity comes,

87
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,630
immediately pick up Yuling Fruit.

88
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,060
GOOD.

89
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,020
We will do it as soon as possible.

90
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,020
Back off immediately if something goes wrong.

91
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,610
exploding pearl,

92
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,250
I would consider it wasted.

93
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,600
GOOD.

94
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,150
Mover.

95
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,190
Lin Zhong.

96
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:50,630
Support it.

97
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:50,960
GOOD.

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,340
MoLing.

99
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,010
Return.

100
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,440
GOOD.

101
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,490
Ray.

102
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,909
Stupid creature.

103
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,950
Where are you looking?

104
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,090
Lightning Boomerang!

105
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,010
Hurts?

106
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,840
Stupid creatures, come get us.

107
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,560
this creature

108
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,170
not as stupid as you think.

109
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,860
It doesn't seem like it will disappear even if I die.

110
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,000
Hermana Qian's.

111
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,290
Turn around in silence.

112
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,010
It seems that you can not fish.

113
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,880
Attack together.

114
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,980
I have to break his defense.

115
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,510
it's time

116
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,750
Get out of the way!

117
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,320
It worked.

118
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,860
Don't be careless.

119
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,790
keep an eye on it

120
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,260
Hermana Qian's.

121
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,320
Can you even bear this?

122
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,590
place.

123
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,560
They are almost awake.

124
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,900
Quickly notify the team leader,

125
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,570
back immediately.

126
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,840
Eve of this creature

127
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,790
should have made it to the top
Intermediate level monsters.

128
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,900
It seems to eat a lot of Yuling fruit.

129
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,910
his skills

130
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,860
comparable to Linglun level of late phase.

131
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,560
However,

132
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,480
He's already hurt.

133
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,630
Let's fight again.

134
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,170
Buying time for Sister Qian'er.

135
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:36,940
GOOD.

136
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,660
Hermana Qian's.

137
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,290
Ey,

138
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,990
stupid monkey.

139
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,610
Here.

140
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,200
Come here.

141
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,120
catch me!

142
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm in a hurry.

143
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,840
Finally I got it.

144
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,520
¡ Mu Chen!

145
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,530
I have it!

146
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:21,920
¡Hermana Qian's!

147
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:22,750
Hurry!

148
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,800
you beast!

149
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,780
Arrest.

150
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,410
I will fight you!

151
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,110
Art of the Great Pagoda.

152
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,660
Team leader.

153
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,140
The ice monkey outside had woken up
being bullied by the Ice Monkey King.

154
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,190
Go, hurry up.

155
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,460
Otherwise, there will be no time.

156
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,260
¡ Mu Chen!

157
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,820
Hurry back!

158
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,820
The Ice Monkey King is here,

159
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,940
we can't run away

160
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,100
The Ice Monkey King cared the most about
This Yuling Fruit.

161
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:36,920
I'll get over it.

162
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,730
Leave immediately.

163
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,460
Just me.

164
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:41,770
- You go.
- Should not.

165
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,890
It's very dangerous!

166
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:46,900
¡Ey!

167
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:47,920
Giant creature.

168
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,120
Watch this.

169
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,190
I love you?

170
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,300
Come on, chase me.

171
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,260
Mu Chen.

172
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,360
Leiyin.

173
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,550
Take Sister Qian'er
and Senior Mo Ling back alive.

174
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,280
Otherwise, I won't forgive you!

175
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,920
Go, hurry up.

176
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,350
Let's go.

177
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,190
Mu Chen.

178
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,230
Fast.

179
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,940
Back off.

180
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,490
Apparently,

181
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,950
this creature will stop at nothing
before getting Yuling Fruit.

182
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,900
I have to find a way to get away from it.

183
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,820
Beiling Plains inland is ahead.

184
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,300
There should be a lot of high level monsters.
who could match the Ice Monkey King.

185
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,740
Apparently,

186
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,400
high-level monsters have entered the jurisdiction .

187
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,500
It should be
high level monster cave.

188
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,520
Get in first.

189
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,120
Why are you so quiet?

190
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,950
If you see the frightened look of this creature,

191
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,680
Monster level in this cave
must be very high.
