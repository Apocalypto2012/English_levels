1
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:54,607
Mr. Wilson.

2
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:57,531
This came for you through
the Carlson cover address.

3
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:00,453
There was no card.

4
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,204
There's been a potential compromise down south.

5
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:57,135
Ulysses

6
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:00,304
We can't wait another 24 hours.

7
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:02,714
If you can guarantee that all assets are in place

8
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:03,782
and prepare to move on my order

9
00:02:03,783 --> 00:02:04,783
I'm prepared to move as well.

10
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:11,553
Go back to bed.

11
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:14,555
What were you talking about?

12
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,209
It's grown up talk.

13
00:02:17,825 --> 00:02:19,926
I had a nightmare.

14
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:21,335
Everything's fine.

15
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,855
Can you stay with me another minute?

16
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:32,303
Try to get some sleep.

17
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:36,671
Yes

18
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:40,404
We haven't got time to be sure of this.

19
00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:41,505
This whole thing hinges on support.

20
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:44,870
If we don't have the support I
can't guarantee the outcome.

21
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:45,871
I guarantee the support.

22
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:50,478
That's not a guarantee.
That's not an answer.

23
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:54,644
<i>unintelligible conversation</i>

24
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,084
Margaret tells us that
you work for the CIA.

25
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:11,008
My wife has a vivid imagination.

26
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,373
I'm a trade advisor.

27
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:14,189
Civil servant.

28
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:25,540
Good night.
Good night.

29
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,444
How dare you speak to me that way.

30
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:35,445
Don't ever tell anybody

31
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:37,901
what I do. How dare you.

32
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:38,902
You are never to tell anyone

33
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,201
what is that I do.

34
00:03:41,602 --> 00:03:43,090
Never. Do you understand?

35
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:43,642
Never. What you do?

36
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:45,092
I don't know what you do.

37
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:46,093
You leave at 5, you get home at 10

38
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:47,094
7 days a week.

39
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:48,797
You don't say a dam word to me.

40
00:03:48,873 --> 00:03:49,864
I live with a ghost.

41
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:51,393
I don't know what you do.

42
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:52,394
<i>phone ringing</i>

43
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:00,509
Call back.

44
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:09,210
You're ready?

45
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:10,235
Launch the operation.

46
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,065
Say something.

47
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:14,424
Say something.

48
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,370
I have to go now.

49
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:17,371
Say. Say something.

50
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,372
Talk to me.

51
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:18,690
Say something.

52
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:19,691
Look at me. Say something.

53
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,855
Remember what I said.

54
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:51,732
Don't touch anything.

55
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,471
Merry Christmas Margaret.

56
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:58,196
Edward.

57
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:58,939
Merry Christmas.

58
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,474
Is this young Edward?

59
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:01,475
Would you like to come inside

60
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:03,848
and meet a very special
guest this evening?

61
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:09,225
Oh. Santa Claus

62
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:11,427
Would you like to meet Santa?

63
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,353
Toddy is wonderful with children.

64
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:16,554
Yes. She is.

65
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,913
Would you like a drink Edward.

66
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,446
Thank you.

67
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:26,844
I believe congratulations are in order.

68
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:30,184
The doctor has no more patients.

69
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:31,101
The cost of malpractice.

70
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:35,923
Gentlemen.

71
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:36,991
Edward.

72
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:41,329
Hello.

73
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:42,751
Bill.

74
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:44,250
Gentlemen.

75
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:47,120
You can all be very proud

76
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:48,737
of what you've started.

77
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,296
Merry Christmas.

78
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:54,297
Merry Christmas Bill.

79
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:16,430
Say something.

80
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,122
Surprises are the best part of Christmas

81
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:22,969
Don't you think?

82
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:26,193
How about, games?

83
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,593
How about, ball games?

84
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:32,780
Oh!

85
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:35,545
Can I get you a towel?

86
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,095
I'm, I'm so sorry.

87
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:37,477
Are you all right?

88
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:39,949
All right, you poor thing.

89
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:42,796
I think we should go home.

90
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:43,367
Lower your voice.

91
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:44,795
You can use our bathroom if you like.

92
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:45,796
I might have some dry clothes.

93
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:46,497
Thank you.

94
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:47,209
Come with me Edward.

95
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:48,537
It's all right. Come with me.

96
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:51,077
Can I help you up Mrs. Wilson?

97
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:54,008
No.

98
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,109
Did you know that Philipp is going to be

99
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:56,952
on the Mayan Coffee
Company's board of directors?

100
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,519
Remember what I said
to you about friends?

101
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:16,892
You look good Edward.

102
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:19,223
How long has it been?

103
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,396
Seven, eight years?

104
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:22,972
A lot of water under the bridge.

105
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,223
Carolina and I, we just bought our first house.

106
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:31,214
And everything is already broken

107
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,025
and I spend my weekends fixing things.

108
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,789
By the time I get everything fixed

109
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:36,916
it'll be time to sell the fucking house.

110
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:41,525
Maybe you can give me
a heads up on somebody.

111
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,012
You're asking be to give you FBI files

112
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:51,013
on an American citizen?

113
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:52,014
You know I can't do that.

114
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:53,918
It’s against the law to spy on citizens.

115
00:08:55,863 --> 00:08:56,830
Keep it.

116
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:59,396
Maybe someday you'll change your mind.

117
00:09:24,684 --> 00:09:25,773
<i>door knocking</i>

118
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:28,762
May I come in?

119
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:45,203
You know,  I've never been in your office.

120
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,609
How was the fishing?

121
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,530
It was a bad year.

122
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:51,531
The water is too high.

123
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:58,437
I understand you wanted to personally give
me the operation Zapata list yourself.

124
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:04,472
There isn't one, is there?

125
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:11,099
You know it was a silent operation.

126
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,925
It wasn't silent enough.

127
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:19,100
I've been asked, by the President,

128
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:21,451
to suggest who we no
longer need with us.

129
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:27,689
Who would you recommend, Edward.

130
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:30,168
I serve at the pleasure
of the director, sir.

131
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,929
I'm just a gate keeper.

132
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:36,725
Why is it that people like us

133
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,931
chose to serve

134
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:40,306
for nickels a day.

135
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,158
In a profession that makes us

136
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:44,708
constantly look over our shoulder

137
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:46,588
to see who is watching us.

138
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:48,318
When will you make your decision?

139
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:52,454
Decision?

140
00:10:56,566 --> 00:11:00,374
I serve at the discretion of the
President of the United States.

141
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:04,283
I will do what I think
is best for the country.

142
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,810
It's important that we
find out who's responsible.

143
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:19,273
Good night.

144
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,472
Good night.

145
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:37,665
At 22:42 call received on Berlin
base chief's operational line

146
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,476
man says he is senior officer KGB.

147
00:11:40,477 --> 00:11:41,477
Would not give name.

148
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:43,929
Open up. Thanks.

149
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:52,700
KGB officer asked when Mr.
Edward Wilson is coming.

150
00:11:52,735 --> 00:11:54,894
He wants to know Mr.
Edward Wilson's response.

151
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,651
Tell him Mr. Edward Wilson is here

152
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:01,388
and would like to know what he
intends to provide us with in return.

153
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:10,306
He says, in return for safe journey

154
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,144
he will provide Mr. Wilson

155
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:16,133
will clear understanding of
last three losses in Moscow.

156
00:12:16,922 --> 00:12:20,450
and identities of soviet agents in your country,

157
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:23,868
penetrations of Moscow's station.

158
00:12:25,057 --> 00:12:28,909
Will also speak personally
with Mr. Edward Wilson about

159
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,274
Ulysses.

160
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:34,582
Things that only he knows of Ulysses.

161
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:35,811
How he thinks.

162
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:36,584
What he plans to do.

163
00:12:37,652 --> 00:12:41,883
And what he wants Mr.
Edward to think he is doing.

164
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:46,021
To establish bonafides, he will carry with him

165
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:51,573
KGB surveillance photographs
of all CIA officers in Moscow.

166
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:55,417
I will be more than happy

167
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:56,744
to take

168
00:12:57,517 --> 00:12:58,659
polygraph.

169
00:13:07,183 --> 00:13:08,315
Ulysses.

170
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:14,627
Ask him what his weakness is.

171
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:31,180
The cold.

172
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:34,566
Let's get him over here.

173
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:36,266
My name

174
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:39,256
is Valentin Gregorovich Mironov.

175
00:13:39,257 --> 00:13:40,257
My children's names

176
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:43,350
are Anatoly and Sergei.

177
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:44,753
My father played the cello

178
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:45,891
I play the violin.

179
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:46,892
But, you know this.

180
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,878
I risk my life to come all
the way to tell you this.

181
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,333
To confirm what you already know.

182
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:53,548
You failed the polygraph Mr.Mironov.

183
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:55,934
You know every Russian fails polygraph.

184
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,259
Your polygraph doesn't
understand the Russian soul.

185
00:14:04,703 --> 00:14:06,260
What more do you want?

186
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:08,238
I've given you my bonafides.

187
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:09,844
The names of agents.

188
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,813
Who has been compromised.

189
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,559
Who you need to know about.

190
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:16,969
I wanted to speak to Mr. Edward Wilson.

191
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,021
We were told Mironov was with these men

192
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:21,771
the day the photo were taken.

193
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:24,228
We're not even sure that any
of the circled men are him.

194
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,229
I told you these 3 time already.

195
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,230
?????

196
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:30,144
I want to speak to Mr. Edward Wilson.

197
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:35,882
I would like some tea.

198
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:41,218
The isn't any.

199
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,174
I get thirsty when I say too much.

200
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:47,012
You are going to keep up this
inane questioning for much longer?

201
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:50,684
There is nothing you've told
us we don’t know, Mr. Mironov.

202
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,716
I think you better try a little harder.

203
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,063
I didn't come here to deal with children,

204
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,064
Mr. Lutz.

205
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:00,696
Or is it, Mr. Brocco.

206
00:15:03,515 --> 00:15:04,820
We do our homework too.

207
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,006
Hello Mr. Mironov. I'm Mr. Wilson.

208
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:24,308
Hello.

209
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:25,412
Mother.

210
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:30,118
Ulysses is obsessed with you.

211
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:31,397
Night and day.

212
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:32,412
You are always on his mind.

213
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:35,350
He trusts nobody.

214
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,622
The only one whom he lets close,

215
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:38,833
is his aid.

216
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:40,001
Sasha.

217
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:41,584
He is methodical.

218
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:43,940
He plans things years in advance.

219
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:45,556
For instance

220
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:49,565
you should he has developed a friendship with a certain neighbor of yours

221
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:51,285
Fidel Castro.

222
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,129
A young man.  He has high hopes for him.

223
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:56,268
I understand you had a most

224
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:58,301
interesting fish swim your way.

225
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:02,436
Mr. Allen thought it may be
possible for me to speak with him.

226
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:04,388
With your chaperon of course.

227
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:07,588
I brought him a little gift I'm sure he'll appreciate.

228
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:08,928
Send Mironov immediately.

229
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,653
It'll be nice to be closely
working with you again.

230
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:14,702
I expect you to show me Washington.

231
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:16,636
We can paint the town red together.

232
00:16:19,185 --> 00:16:20,330
Valentine Mironov.

233
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,294
Arch Cummings.

234
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:23,993
It is a great pleasure to meet you.

235
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:24,994
My pleasure.

236
00:16:24,995 --> 00:16:25,830
Now please sit down.

237
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:28,425
Nice to have someone like
you on our side of the street.

238
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:32,322
I thought you may enjoy this.

239
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:34,167
It's something you might appreciate.

240
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:35,444
I hope you haven't read it.

241
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:38,098
Very clever.

242
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,308
Thank you.

243
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,915
All Russian is our orchard.

244
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,724
The land is great and beautiful.

245
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,076
There are many wonderful places in it.

246
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:54,381
Think Anya.

247
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:55,836
Your grandfather.

248
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:57,492
Your great grandfather.

249
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,115
This is very bad translation.

250
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:01,541
It is much funnier in Russian.

251
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:31,581
I'm due at a meeting.

252
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:56,855
Are you Laura?

253
00:17:58,288 --> 00:17:59,129
What?

254
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:02,102
Are you Laura? I'm suppose
to offer you a ride.

255
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,473
Hello Edward.

256
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:30,198
Hello Laura.

257
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,760
Why all the mystery?

258
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:38,652
Do you have children?

259
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:40,344
I have a boy.

260
00:18:42,073 --> 00:18:43,093
Edward Jr.

261
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:49,987
Do you have anybody?

262
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:54,691
A cat.

263
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:04,099
I often imagine what my life
would have been like with you.

264
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:06,885
And what do you imagine?

265
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,304
I thought you might teach.

266
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:12,996
Probably poetry.

267
00:19:14,908 --> 00:19:18,378
I saw us living in a small college town.

268
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:35,340
You once said to me you were afraid

269
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:37,991
your life was already
planed out for you.

270
00:19:42,203 --> 00:19:44,274
Are you doing what you want to do?

271
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,686
Life has been full of surprises.

272
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:17,399
You owe me a day at the beach.

273
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:02,787
How long do you think you'll be.

274
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:05,272
As long as it takes.

275
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:11,995
I think maybe I'll go ahead.

276
00:21:12,282 --> 00:21:13,332
All right.

277
00:21:28,576 --> 00:21:29,531
Mother?

278
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,313
There's an envelope for you on the desk.

279
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,475
Hey, you look lovely.

280
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:39,300
Thank you.

281
00:22:27,603 --> 00:22:30,354
It's not enough that you
ignore me our whole life

282
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:31,355
you have to humiliate me?

283
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:33,074
You disgust me.

284
00:22:33,974 --> 00:22:34,801
Your disgusting.

285
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:02,653
Let’s start from the last ?????

286
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:37,197
Mother forgot some of her things.

287
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:51,383
I'll see you at home.

288
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:52,329
Are you Laura?

289
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:54,599
Yes.

290
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,555
I was asked to give you this.

291
00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:13,829
In an unprecedented effort
to improve US-Soviet ties

292
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,401
premier Khrushchev began his 10
day tour of the United States today.

293
00:25:17,436 --> 00:25:21,445
The visit will start with a tour by President
Eisenhower of our nation's capital...

294
00:25:23,888 --> 00:25:25,536
All right. Now set it down.

295
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,748
It's perfect.

296
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:47,433
Our glee club has been chosen to
compete in the national competition.

297
00:25:49,356 --> 00:25:51,006
Won't you come with me?

298
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,370
Would you like me to?

299
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:55,518
Very much.

300
00:26:30,618 --> 00:26:31,959
I'll get your things.

301
00:26:35,348 --> 00:26:36,509
It's good to have you home.

302
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:04,386
How was your trip?

303
00:27:05,363 --> 00:27:06,844
As smooth as silk.

304
00:27:07,324 --> 00:27:12,464
Why FBI escort made the
trip her very pleasant.

305
00:27:25,588 --> 00:27:26,744
Which one is your son?

306
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,468
Top row. Third from the right.

307
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:35,386
He's a handsome young
man. My congratulations.

308
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:40,121
We're particularly concerned about Cuba.

309
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,014
Your friend.

310
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,316
He's too close to home.

311
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:49,091
You don't appreciate him
breathing down your neck.

312
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:53,299
If we continue down this road.

313
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,560
There will be a third World War.

314
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:58,816
I don't think either
of us wants a real war.

315
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,052
What would you do for a living then?

316
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:07,146
If he keeps calling attention to himself

317
00:28:07,147 --> 00:28:08,147
at some point

318
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,335
we might be forced to
send him a surprise.

319
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:15,012
and I don't want that to come
as a surprise to your people.

320
00:28:15,213 --> 00:28:17,272
He is very important to us.

321
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:20,559
We would not like to be surprised.

322
00:28:26,784 --> 00:28:27,909
Be well.

323
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:31,884
Be well.

324
00:28:49,003 --> 00:28:50,149
I am today

325
00:28:50,473 --> 00:28:51,607
announcing my candidacy

326
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:54,164
for the presidency of the United States.

327
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,379
The presidency is the most powerful office

328
00:28:57,457 --> 00:28:57,879
in the free World.

329
00:28:58,714 --> 00:29:01,606
Through its leadership
can come a more vital life

330
00:29:02,094 --> 00:29:03,343
for all of our people.

331
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:06,568
In it are centered the
hopes the globe around us

332
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,770
for freedom and a more secure life.

333
00:29:10,401 --> 00:29:13,298
Senator Kennedy, if you don't
win the presidential nomination,

334
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:14,299
will you accept the vice presidency.

335
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,688
I shall not, under any condition,
be a candidate for vice president.

336
00:29:18,689 --> 00:29:24,152
If I fail in this endeavor I shall return
and serve in the United States Senate.

337
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:27,079
We have a secure
?????, Stockholm Station.

338
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
Station reports they have a coronel,

339
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:30,433
directorate K, counter intelligence.

340
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:31,496
Do we have a name?

341
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:33,289
May I help you sir?

342
00:29:33,324 --> 00:29:36,481
I'm a coronel with KGB requesting asylum.

343
00:29:36,962 --> 00:29:37,834
What is your name?

344
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,142
My name is Valentin Gregorovich Mironov.

345
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:53,521
My name is Valentin Gregorovich Mironov.

346
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:57,068
This other man who says he is Valentin Mironov

347
00:29:57,085 --> 00:29:58,508
is not who he pretends to be.

348
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:00,828
Right? His real name is Yuri Modin.

349
00:30:02,108 --> 00:30:03,537
He was Ulysses right hand

350
00:30:03,455 --> 00:30:04,668
he is Ulysses'....

351
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,542
Will you just tell me your real name.

352
00:30:07,612 --> 00:30:10,006
It is just Ulysses trying to discredit me.

353
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:17,819
My real name is Valentin
Gregorovich Mironov.

354
00:30:19,248 --> 00:30:21,701
I was born in Brabusk in 1924.

355
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:24,733
Attended the State Institute of International Relations.

356
00:30:24,897 --> 00:30:27,064
Served for 3 years in naval intelligence.

357
00:30:27,222 --> 00:30:29,404
My wife's name is Tamara Nakovsky.

358
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:32,724
My children's name are Anatoly and Sergei.

359
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:36,854
My father is a cellist, I play the violin.

360
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:40,479
All I want is my freedom.

361
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:47,301
Pick him up.

362
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:50,321
Are you alright?

363
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:52,075
I'm sorry.

364
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:53,538
You see what you made me do?

365
00:30:54,507 --> 00:30:55,262
Now just

366
00:30:55,851 --> 00:30:56,716
tell me the truth.

367
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:01,916
Because, we're going to be here

368
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:03,909
as long as it takes.

369
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,910
I already told you.

370
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:05,911
I want to know

371
00:31:05,912 --> 00:31:06,712
the truth.

372
00:31:06,713 --> 00:31:07,613
Tell me

373
00:31:07,614 --> 00:31:08,558
You know may name.

374
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:09,315
your real name.

375
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,611
Mr.  Please. I'm not lying.

376
00:31:10,646 --> 00:31:11,931
I'd like to believe you

377
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:12,932
but I don’t believe
you. You understand?

378
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:14,901
Now tell me your name.

379
00:31:14,902 --> 00:31:15,902
My name is Mironov.

380
00:31:16,924 --> 00:31:18,960
It's Valentin Gregorovish Mironov.

381
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:19,677
Is that your name?

382
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:20,236
Yeah.

383
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:21,309
Is that your real name.

384
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,310
Yes. This is my name.

385
00:31:22,311 --> 00:31:23,311
Tell me your real name.

386
00:31:23,312 --> 00:31:24,312
I told you my name.

387
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:25,313
Tell me your name.

388
00:31:25,314 --> 00:31:26,314
I told you a 100 times...

389
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:27,315
Because we're not going anywhere

390
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:28,316
I just want you to know that

391
00:31:28,317 --> 00:31:29,317
we are not going anywhere

392
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:32,084
Today, tomorrow, next week, next month

393
00:31:32,085 --> 00:31:34,195
He is your mold, I'm not your mold.

394
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:34,968
You understand?

395
00:31:34,969 --> 00:31:36,269
I'll be right in front of you.

396
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:36,970
The same position.

397
00:31:37,968 --> 00:31:38,747
What is your name?

398
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:41,885
Tell me your name.

399
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:44,986
Tell it.

400
00:31:45,325 --> 00:31:46,087
Tell it.

401
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:46,788
Tell it to me.

402
00:31:46,924 --> 00:31:47,689
Tell it to me again.

403
00:31:48,276 --> 00:31:48,990
Tell it to me again.

404
00:31:49,582 --> 00:31:52,192
Tell me your fucking name.

405
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:02,636
Shut up! Shut up!

406
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:04,199
Tell me your name.

407
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:06,455
Tell me your name.

408
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:07,484
Tell

409
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:08,385
me

410
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:09,286
your

411
00:32:09,189 --> 00:32:09,987
fucking

412
00:32:09,982 --> 00:32:10,688
name.

413
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:12,189
Tell me your name.

414
00:32:12,727 --> 00:32:13,490
Tell me your name.

415
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:17,857
Come on. Get it off. Get it off.

416
00:32:20,703 --> 00:32:21,862
Put him down.

417
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:31,460
Your name.

418
00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:39,037
Tell me your name.

419
00:32:52,988 --> 00:32:55,765
What is your name?

420
00:32:55,966 --> 00:32:59,417
Sir, this is Lysergic acid diethylamide.

421
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,773
It's called LSD.

422
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,396
We've had some very favorable
results as a truth serum.

423
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:16,428
<i>signing in Russian</i>

424
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:32,152
<i>speaking Russian</i>

425
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,830
Soviet power it a myth.

426
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:34,906
A freak show.

427
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,172
There are no spare parts

428
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:39,267
nothing is working, nothing

429
00:34:39,438 --> 00:34:42,786
it's nothing but painted rust.

430
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:47,787
But you.

431
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:52,881
You need to keep the Russian myth alive

432
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:56,152
to maintain your military
industrial complex.

433
00:34:56,752 --> 00:34:59,210
Your system depends on Russia being perceived

434
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:00,541
as a mortal threat.

435
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,292
It's not a threat.

436
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,819
It was never a threat

437
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,521
it will never be a threat.

438
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:14,038
It is

439
00:35:15,385 --> 00:35:16,201
a rotted

440
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,224
bloated

441
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:20,684
cow.

442
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:33,903
I am

443
00:35:34,957 --> 00:35:36,788
Valentin Gregorovish Mironov.

444
00:35:38,635 --> 00:35:40,098
And I am

445
00:35:40,983 --> 00:35:41,768
free.

446
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,396
Shit.

447
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:49,466
Shit.

448
00:36:04,104 --> 00:36:05,513
If you would like

449
00:36:06,937 --> 00:36:09,447
I'd be willing to take
the truth serum at once.

450
00:36:12,093 --> 00:36:13,317
I've nothing to hide.

451
00:36:15,904 --> 00:36:17,616
I am who I say I am.

452
00:36:25,578 --> 00:36:26,705
I know.

453
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,332
We sent those who are leaving us

454
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:48,050
to go into the World, with the knowledge

455
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:49,529
wherever they go

456
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,050
whatever they do

457
00:36:51,729 --> 00:36:52,948
They will never be alone.

458
00:36:53,976 --> 00:36:55,643
They will always be one of us.

459
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:57,645
And we sing

460
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,206
Bonesmen, all here.

461
00:36:59,241 --> 00:36:59,902
All here.

462
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,445
<i>singing</i>

463
00:37:11,286 --> 00:37:12,880
I didn't know you smoked.

464
00:37:14,444 --> 00:37:16,704
There are a few things
you don't know about me.

465
00:37:25,087 --> 00:37:27,261
I've spoken to a recruiter here.

466
00:37:28,629 --> 00:37:31,041
I would like, very much, to join CIA.

467
00:37:32,615 --> 00:37:34,936
There a lot of things you can do, Edward.

468
00:37:36,143 --> 00:37:38,073
I'd like you to think about this carefully.

469
00:37:38,074 --> 00:37:39,074
I have thought about it very carefully.

470
00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:40,397
It's what I want to do

471
00:37:40,461 --> 00:37:41,579
I want to join the agency.

472
00:37:44,616 --> 00:37:46,092
I want to make you proud of me.

473
00:37:46,127 --> 00:37:47,265
I am proud of you.

474
00:37:47,695 --> 00:37:49,500
Well I've made up my mind father.

475
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:53,537
You can stop him.

476
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,550
He doesn't understand what he's getting into

477
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:57,584
you can stop him.

478
00:37:57,585 --> 00:37:58,585
I can't tell him what to do.

479
00:37:58,586 --> 00:37:59,275
Yes you can.

480
00:37:59,303 --> 00:37:59,962
No.

481
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,638
Yes you can because

482
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,358
he is doing it for you.

483
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:04,936
Because he wants you to be proud of him

484
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,427
and he wants to feel closer to you.

485
00:38:06,428 --> 00:38:07,290
You can have them rejected him.

486
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:08,836
Absolutely not. I won't do that to him.

487
00:38:08,837 --> 00:38:09,837
Of course you won't.

488
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:11,038
You won't do anything for anyone but yourself.

489
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:13,485
That is unfair.

490
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:14,486
Unfair.

491
00:38:14,487 --> 00:38:15,287
That is unfair.

492
00:38:15,288 --> 00:38:16,998
You abandon people when
they need you the most.

493
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:18,133
I don't abandon people.

494
00:38:18,134 --> 00:38:18,834
You abandon people.

495
00:38:18,885 --> 00:38:20,125
I do not abandon people.

496
00:38:20,126 --> 00:38:20,826
It's true.

497
00:38:20,927 --> 00:38:21,627
I've stood by you.

498
00:38:21,628 --> 00:38:22,473
Stood by me?

499
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:23,889
For 22 to years I've stood by you.

500
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:24,890
You don't what it is to stand by somebody.

501
00:38:24,891 --> 00:38:26,916
I've stood by you and I've stood by him.

502
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:27,917
You ignored him.

503
00:38:27,918 --> 00:38:29,338
I've done everything to
be a good father to him.

504
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:30,339
You have done no such thing.

505
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,172
I married you because of him.

506
00:38:57,913 --> 00:38:59,533
I know you don't love me.

507
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:01,561
But you love him.

508
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,786
And no matter what

509
00:39:03,787 --> 00:39:06,050
you should stand by him
and you should protect him.

510
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:07,949
I don’t need you to tell me
I have to protect my son.

511
00:39:08,287 --> 00:39:09,768
Promise me that you will protect him.

512
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,235
I'll protect him.

513
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,979
Today, in Havana, Fidel Castro expelled

514
00:39:23,006 --> 00:39:24,750
high profile crime figures from Cuba.

515
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:27,390
He's taking control of their hotels and casinos.

516
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:29,843
Popular vacation destinations
for many Americans.

517
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:32,610
Castro has nationalized over a billion dollars

518
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:34,450
from US businesses in the past six months.

519
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:36,290
And there is not telling what the communist dictator

520
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,771
I want to see a man about a hat.

521
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:41,487
He had 3 casinos down there
until Castro sent them home.

522
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:44,667
These people know how to be discreet.

523
00:39:45,939 --> 00:39:47,875
With the right encouragement, he could help.

524
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:49,525
And he's very patriotic.

525
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,068
Jimmy.

526
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:52,729
Mr. Carlson.

527
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:56,037
Tina. The kids.

528
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,305
Alright. Come on kids.

529
00:40:03,353 --> 00:40:04,053
Sit down.

530
00:40:04,554 --> 00:40:06,159
Some water, some coffee, whatever?

531
00:40:07,726 --> 00:40:09,143
Is there someplace else we could go.

532
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:15,050
All right daddy. We're going down to
the beach. We'll be back in a while.

533
00:40:15,051 --> 00:40:18,680
Make sure they don't go into the
water unless somebody is watching them.

534
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:20,356
No, I'm going to let them down.

535
00:40:20,357 --> 00:40:23,255
Make sure they put their shoes
on. They'll burn their feet.

536
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,724
Yea. We're getting their shoes.

537
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:26,311
All right come on. Let’s go.

538
00:40:30,654 --> 00:40:32,350
So, what do you want
to talk to me about?

539
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:35,305
The government is about to deport
you, for certain activities.

540
00:40:36,206 --> 00:40:38,421
I've been in this country
since I'm two months old.

541
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,735
What’s that make me. Italian?

542
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:42,075
I'm American.

543
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:44,926
And they are trying to send me back?

544
00:40:45,013 --> 00:40:47,259
They can have the deportation order reviewed.

545
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:50,930
Have you classified as highly sensitive

546
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:52,225
for national security.

547
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,593
I can take the government off
your back it you can help us.

548
00:40:55,715 --> 00:40:57,491
You are the guys that scare me.

549
00:40:58,651 --> 00:41:00,498
You're the people that make big wars.

550
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:03,695
No. We make sure the wars
are small ones, Mr. Palmi.

551
00:41:05,691 --> 00:41:06,817
Let me ask you something.

552
00:41:07,945 --> 00:41:11,159
We Italians, we got our
families and we got the church.

553
00:41:12,714 --> 00:41:14,411
The Irish, they have the homeland.

554
00:41:15,385 --> 00:41:16,704
The Jews, their tradition.

555
00:41:18,335 --> 00:41:20,572
Even the niggers. They've got their music.

556
00:41:22,585 --> 00:41:24,810
What about you people, Mr. Carlson?

557
00:41:25,011 --> 00:41:25,811
What do you have?

558
00:41:28,248 --> 00:41:29,584
The United States of America.

559
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,645
The rest of you are just visiting.

560
00:41:39,302 --> 00:41:42,559
The president wants the noise
level on the operation turned down.

561
00:41:45,996 --> 00:41:47,461
How many men are involved?

562
00:41:49,418 --> 00:41:50,338
Fifteen hundred.

563
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:55,382
Tell them we are going instead to Bahia de Cochinos.

564
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:57,107
Noise level will be way down.

565
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,151
See you inside.

566
00:42:28,734 --> 00:42:30,760
Could you hear what
we were talking about?

567
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:32,215
No. I didn't hear anything.

568
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,706
If something was heard.

569
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:38,820
It has to stay in this room.

570
00:42:39,696 --> 00:42:40,773
Oh, I know that, father.

571
00:42:44,918 --> 00:42:45,809
All right.

572
00:43:03,685 --> 00:43:04,796
Bonesmen.

573
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:12,820
All here.

574
00:43:14,745 --> 00:43:15,780
Agency first.

575
00:43:16,672 --> 00:43:17,323
God second.

576
00:43:17,324 --> 00:43:18,324
Thank you Lord.

577
00:43:18,325 --> 00:43:19,325
For bringing us here safely here

578
00:43:19,326 --> 00:43:22,191
to be with our brothers
and loved ones again.

579
00:43:23,106 --> 00:43:25,314
Our prayers are with our brothers

580
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:27,418
whom God has seen fit to take

581
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,008
into his gentle arms this year.

582
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:33,089
The honorable Senator
John Russell Senior.

583
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:36,027
Mr. Stephen Lummis Evans.

584
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,753
Would you like to dance Clover?

585
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:14,546
I haven't been Clover for a long time.

586
00:44:49,025 --> 00:44:51,116
I'm going to Phoenix
to live with my mother.

587
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,985
Based on the ringing of the church bells

588
00:45:03,011 --> 00:45:04,828
we're going to assume the recording was made

589
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:06,795
at the same time the photograph was taken.

590
00:45:06,796 --> 00:45:09,664
We've check the schedules for
flights leaving major airports

591
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:12,551
at or around 10 o'clock at
night for a two week period.

592
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:14,820
There were flights leaving nine cities.

593
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:19,697
Six were places that would also
potentially have a fan made in Belgium.

594
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:23,883
Five of those places were also either
tropical or in their summer seasons.

595
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:26,930
Three of those were places
where French is spoken.

596
00:45:28,198 --> 00:45:30,001
We think the tape was made in either

597
00:45:30,053 --> 00:45:33,595
Dakar,  Abidjan or Congo Leo.

598
00:48:28,245 --> 00:48:29,353
It is all gone.

599
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:36,882
Hello mother.

600
00:48:39,178 --> 00:48:40,011
Let me show you.

601
00:48:46,773 --> 00:48:50,002
As you see, no cameras,
no tape recorders.

602
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:54,945
There is nothing else to know.

603
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:00,889
Can I play something for you?

604
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,728
Everything is a secret.

605
00:49:11,647 --> 00:49:13,604
?????

606
00:49:13,804 --> 00:49:16,546
What was such a big secret
that his own son couldn't know?

607
00:49:19,584 --> 00:49:21,150
He was standing outside talking.

608
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,921
I heard something I wasn't supposed to,

609
00:49:24,949 --> 00:49:26,755
and he knew I'd listened his conversation.

610
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:31,247
I heard him say something in Spanish.

611
00:49:33,242 --> 00:49:34,242
Bahia de Cochinos.

612
00:49:35,101 --> 00:49:37,058
Bahia de Cochinos.

613
00:49:38,236 --> 00:49:39,442
I'm afraid of him.

614
00:49:41,897 --> 00:49:43,995
Your are safe here with me.

615
00:49:45,662 --> 00:49:48,542
People who really love each
other don't have secrets.

616
00:49:50,627 --> 00:49:52,727
I have something for you.

617
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:03,075
I love you so much.

618
00:50:05,057 --> 00:50:06,368
I love you so much.

619
00:50:13,864 --> 00:50:17,627
She's been an active asset
of ours for some time.

620
00:50:21,181 --> 00:50:22,139
Until now.

621
00:50:24,305 --> 00:50:25,666
She loves your son.

622
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:32,040
Sometimes even

623
00:50:32,267 --> 00:50:33,267
spies fall in love.

624
00:50:37,088 --> 00:50:38,897
We can protect him.

625
00:50:39,557 --> 00:50:40,771
Make him safe.

626
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:42,950
Nobody would know. Not even him.

627
00:50:47,268 --> 00:50:49,898
All it would require is for you

628
00:50:52,213 --> 00:50:52,936
to help us.

629
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,085
When your help is needed.

630
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:13,458
I thought you would like to see this.

631
00:51:17,858 --> 00:51:20,606
She is a very pretty girl.

632
00:51:21,169 --> 00:51:23,580
It is easy to see why he fell for her.

633
00:51:39,442 --> 00:51:42,586
I know it is an extremely
difficult situation for you.

634
00:51:47,439 --> 00:51:50,357
But I am afraid I'm going to need your answer very soon.

635
00:51:53,712 --> 00:51:55,497
You must decide

636
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:58,818
what is of more importance to you

637
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,219
your country or

638
00:52:07,522 --> 00:52:08,345
or your son.

639
00:52:38,842 --> 00:52:40,547
She is not who you think she is.

640
00:52:42,754 --> 00:52:44,645
She's not a friendly, Edward.

641
00:52:45,798 --> 00:52:46,819
I don't believe you.

642
00:52:48,217 --> 00:52:49,604
Why should I believe you?

643
00:52:50,903 --> 00:52:52,952
You told me yourself not to trust anybody.

644
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,843
You're the master of creating the truth.

645
00:52:59,152 --> 00:53:00,205
I love her.

646
00:53:01,459 --> 00:53:02,763
I've asked her to marry me.

647
00:53:03,752 --> 00:53:05,309
I will not let you
take that away from me.

648
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:07,027
I can't protect you anymore.

649
00:53:07,028 --> 00:53:08,028
I can't keep you safe.

650
00:53:08,029 --> 00:53:09,029
Safe?

651
00:53:11,714 --> 00:53:12,430
Safe?

652
00:53:11,447 --> 00:53:13,673
I never felt safe.

653
00:53:13,674 --> 00:53:15,281
I was always frighten.

654
00:53:15,316 --> 00:53:16,820
I always lived in fear that something

655
00:53:16,855 --> 00:53:18,063
awful was going to happen to you.

656
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:20,139
Or if not, to mother or to me.

657
00:53:20,249 --> 00:53:23,083
I was always afraid because
everything was a secret.

658
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:43,670
Edward.

659
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:44,657
Hello, may I come in.

660
00:54:44,658 --> 00:54:45,658
Yes, of course.

661
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:47,414
Is everything all right?

662
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:50,878
I was on my way home from work

663
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,627
and I had this overwhelming desire

664
00:54:52,628 --> 00:54:54,127
to hear you play the violin.

665
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:55,108
Play the violin?

666
00:54:57,022 --> 00:54:58,510
Edward, I am so tired.

667
00:54:58,511 --> 00:55:00,041
Can't this way until tomorrow?

668
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:02,042
I'd appreciate it if you played it now.

669
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,672
Now.

670
00:58:19,303 --> 00:58:21,635
I just wanted to hear something
from you that was true.

671
00:58:32,003 --> 00:58:33,359
He was careless.

672
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,716
FBI.  You're under arrest. Stand up.

673
00:58:38,773 --> 00:58:41,015
Didn't learn how to hide in plain sight.

674
00:58:41,216 --> 00:58:42,016
Where are they taking me?

675
00:58:42,896 --> 00:58:43,830
I can't go home.

676
00:58:43,865 --> 00:58:45,725
You know they can trust me anymore.

677
00:58:46,212 --> 00:58:47,779
You know what they will do to me?

678
00:58:48,511 --> 00:58:49,481
Sorry Edward.

679
00:58:51,889 --> 00:58:53,822
I truly did like you.

680
00:58:55,428 --> 00:58:56,887
In another world we actually

681
00:58:57,095 --> 00:58:59,175
would have been quite good friends.

682
00:59:02,685 --> 00:59:04,162
Hey.  Are you still there mother?

683
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,794
Your worst fear has come true.

684
00:59:11,205 --> 00:59:12,968
Alone and friendless.

685
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:16,852
Without a country of your own.

686
01:00:29,704 --> 01:00:32,514
We have a whole new place to fight over.

687
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,835
The stars.

688
01:00:41,192 --> 01:00:42,036
Your offer.

689
01:00:46,048 --> 01:00:47,300
I have to decline.

690
01:00:59,069 --> 01:01:02,171
You've succeeded in stopping
us from taking back Cuba.

691
01:01:06,194 --> 01:01:07,577
The damage is done.

692
01:01:11,181 --> 01:01:13,011
There is no need for you to hurt my son.

693
01:01:19,858 --> 01:01:21,579
Let’s just leave it between you and me.

694
01:01:26,532 --> 01:01:27,742
Very well.

695
01:01:29,961 --> 01:01:30,883
I will wait.

696
01:01:33,495 --> 01:01:35,079
But there will come a time

697
01:01:37,762 --> 01:01:40,076
when I will ask you with a problem

698
01:01:41,275 --> 01:01:43,051
that wouldn't cost you much

699
01:01:43,194 --> 01:01:45,168
but would be of some value to me.

700
01:01:48,981 --> 01:01:51,194
You never know what
the future will bring.

701
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,730
Friends can be enemies

702
01:01:55,731 --> 01:01:57,499
and enemies friends.

703
01:02:14,218 --> 01:02:15,537
This girl.

704
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:20,183
Neither of us can be sure about her.

705
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:26,979
But she's about to be
a part of your family.

706
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:31,636
I believe in family.

707
01:02:37,138 --> 01:02:39,259
You want her to be a
part of your family.

708
01:02:41,484 --> 01:02:42,464
Don't you?

709
01:03:07,912 --> 01:03:09,205
It was good to see you.

710
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:13,736
We will talk again.

711
01:03:14,831 --> 01:03:15,814
My dear friend.

712
01:03:18,106 --> 01:03:20,137
<i>speaking Russian</i>

713
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:25,792
Sorry to bother.

714
01:03:26,029 --> 01:03:28,359
I want to buy a little
souvenir to my daughter.

715
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,305
They have no change.

716
01:03:29,457 --> 01:03:30,867
<i>speaking Russian</i>

717
01:03:30,902 --> 01:03:33,450
What does it cost?

718
01:03:35,486 --> 01:03:36,763
Here. It's a gift.

719
01:03:36,764 --> 01:03:38,876
Regards from the United
States government.

720
01:03:40,603 --> 01:03:43,322
It's a cardinal rule to
be generous in a democracy.

721
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:49,635
Thank you.

722
01:04:43,507 --> 01:04:44,894
So where is she?

723
01:04:45,629 --> 01:04:46,992
We are going to meet her at the church.

724
01:04:47,507 --> 01:04:48,395
I can't wait to meet her.

725
01:04:53,196 --> 01:04:54,118
Yes. That's good.

726
01:05:10,174 --> 01:05:11,142
Come on in.

727
01:05:20,633 --> 01:05:21,515
Hello Margaret.

728
01:05:26,844 --> 01:05:27,906
Well let's celebrate.

729
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:29,375
I'll get some champagne

730
01:05:36,871 --> 01:05:38,032
How was the flight?

731
01:05:40,876 --> 01:05:41,961
It was long.

732
01:05:52,346 --> 01:05:54,076
How do you like living in Phoenix.

733
01:05:58,547 --> 01:06:00,315
It's the first time I've slept in years.

734
01:06:05,126 --> 01:06:06,082
Here we go.

735
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:33,193
To your happiness.

736
01:06:33,659 --> 01:06:34,702
To your happiness.

737
01:08:22,585 --> 01:08:23,472
Your wife.

738
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:25,506
What have you done.

739
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:29,999
Will you go inside mother?

740
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,049
You can go inside, mother.

741
01:08:35,438 --> 01:08:36,915
Please, just go in the church.

742
01:08:47,797 --> 01:08:49,328
She's pregnant.

743
01:09:07,862 --> 01:09:09,812
You can't know the difference.

744
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:12,998
No.

745
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:14,834
I love you.

746
01:09:16,714 --> 01:09:17,698
I love you so much.

747
01:09:42,854 --> 01:09:43,770
Mr. Wilson?

748
01:09:43,771 --> 01:09:44,547
Mr. Hayes.

749
01:09:45,872 --> 01:09:47,152
You've been here before Mother?

750
01:09:47,153 --> 01:09:48,153
No I haven't.

751
01:09:49,262 --> 01:09:50,520
Who's idea was that?

752
01:09:51,794 --> 01:09:52,998
It's classified.

753
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:58,930
Mr. Allen has notified
the President he'll resign.

754
01:10:01,256 --> 01:10:03,136
Something about Swiss bank accounts.

755
01:10:05,131 --> 01:10:06,665
Where did these come from?

756
01:10:06,948 --> 01:10:07,718
They were in the car.

757
01:10:08,074 --> 01:10:09,650
I thought you had them sent down, sir.

758
01:10:10,785 --> 01:10:12,120
Seems the greedy bastard has

759
01:10:12,121 --> 01:10:13,921
been hiding money away for years.

760
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:16,163
Whoever had the statementsm

761
01:10:16,346 --> 01:10:18,477
sent it to him in a box of Swiss chocolates.

762
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:22,842
Wasn't you, was it.

763
01:10:26,542 --> 01:10:28,467
The President asked me to become director

764
01:10:28,527 --> 01:10:30,699
and do a complete
housecleaning at my discretion.

765
01:10:31,355 --> 01:10:32,589
I need someone I can trust.

766
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:35,296
After all, we're still brothers.

767
01:10:37,512 --> 01:10:39,539
This building doesn't get built without you.

768
01:10:40,177 --> 01:10:41,707
Your're CIA's heart and soul.

769
01:10:42,971 --> 01:10:43,897
Who knows.

770
01:10:44,104 --> 01:10:46,237
You might have a secret about
me in that safe of yours.

771
01:10:48,931 --> 01:10:50,213
This whole wing

772
01:10:50,971 --> 01:10:52,218
will be your part of the World.

773
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:53,532
Counter intelligence.

774
01:10:54,816 --> 01:10:56,685
Take a look around. I've
got an oversight meeting.

775
01:10:57,269 --> 01:10:58,227
Can you imagine?

776
01:10:59,162 --> 01:11:00,515
They think they can look into our closet.

777
01:11:01,362 --> 01:11:02,555
As if we'll let them.

778
01:11:06,502 --> 01:11:08,596
I remember a senator once asked me,

779
01:11:09,573 --> 01:11:11,187
when we talk about CIA

780
01:11:11,222 --> 01:11:13,317
why we never use the
work THE in front of it.

781
01:11:14,738 --> 01:11:15,579
And I asked him,

782
01:11:15,614 --> 01:11:18,094
do you put the work THE in front of God?

783
01:12:07,509 --> 01:12:09,114
They are right what they said about me.

784
01:12:10,386 --> 01:12:11,730
I was weak.

785
01:12:12,867 --> 01:12:13,722
A coward.

786
01:12:17,315 --> 01:12:18,955
I compromised myself

787
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:22,058
My honor, my family.

788
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,267
My country.

789
01:12:26,564 --> 01:12:27,985
I am ashamed of myself.

790
01:12:30,356 --> 01:12:31,257
To my wife.

791
01:12:32,486 --> 01:12:33,996
I'm sorry I've done this to you.

792
01:12:36,638 --> 01:12:37,291
To my son.

793
01:12:38,606 --> 01:12:40,826
I hope you will grow to be a courageous man.

794
01:12:42,078 --> 01:12:43,315
A good husband.

795
01:12:44,514 --> 01:12:45,393
A good father.

796
01:12:51,975 --> 01:12:53,632
I hope whatever you decide to do

797
01:12:53,733 --> 01:12:54,926
you lead a good full life.

798
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:03,252
I hope whatever your dreams may be,

799
01:13:04,119 --> 01:13:04,768
come true.

800
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:10,812
Your loving husband and father.
