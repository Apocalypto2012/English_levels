1
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:58,875
<i>After surviving
relentless attacks from mercenary forces</i>

2
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:00,543
<i>in the escalating oil wars,</i>

3
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:03,792
<i>sources tell us that pleas
have finally been answered</i>

4
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:07,375
<i>for the besieged employees of
Yutime Chinese oil refinery</i>

5
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:08,583
<i>in the Middle East.</i>

6
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:11,750
{\an8}<i>Professor Cheng, Yutime's
Director of Operations,</i>

7
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:15,250
{\an8}<i>tells us that a private security
team from China has volunteered</i>

8
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:19,083
{\an8}<i>to carry out the high-risk mission of
extracting her trapped oil workers,</i>

9
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:20,708
{\an8}<i>who are facing certain death,</i>

10
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,542
{\an8}<i>and escorting them to the
safety of the Green Zone.</i>

11
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:38,917
Commander Luo,

12
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,459
we're approaching the LZ.

13
00:02:41,793 --> 00:02:42,793
Copy, Captain.

14
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:10,667
- Dragon Luo.
- Yes.

15
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:12,042
Professor
Cheng, head of Yutime Oil.

16
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:13,000
Hello, professor.

17
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,417
Thank you
for coming to rescue us.

18
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:17,083
Can you
bring me up to speed?

19
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:19,625
- Of course, follow me.
- HaiMing, unload.

20
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:20,667
You two, follow me. Hurry up.

21
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:21,583
Yes, sir.

22
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:24,417
We are
only safe inside the refinery.

23
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:27,125
Don't worry,
we're here to escort you out.

24
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:30,043
Our planes are waiting
for you in the Green Zone.

25
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,042
Do you know who the rebels are?

26
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:33,208
I don't know.

27
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,251
They want us to give
up the refinery.

28
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:37,208
We've been surrounded
for two weeks.

29
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,583
They launch an attack
every couple of days.

30
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:41,875
We've increased our security

31
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:43,917
but if they launch another
attack like yesterday,

32
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:45,583
we won't make it.

33
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:47,001
We must evacuate immediately.

34
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:49,750
How many
are we evacuating?

35
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,351
Four hundred and
ninety eight including the children.

36
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,458
There's a lot
of things to do before we go.

37
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:57,793
We plan to leave at dawn.

38
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:03,500
Gets it all and
is happy with it.

39
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,959
Looks happy, looks concerned.
He's concerned now.

40
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:08,584
It's in the sand.

41
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:11,501
I made it.

42
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,000
How's it going, Chris?

43
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,417
You're late, Henry.

44
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:19,876
Jesus, Chris.

45
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:23,834
Here's your money, as promised.

46
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:27,918
We go in and out. Nobody hurt.

47
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:31,667
You're gonna count it?

48
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:33,417
Hell yeah, I'm gonna count it.

49
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:35,250
Listen, you're family
but you're a thief.

50
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:36,083
Ah.

51
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:38,164
Bald Eagle over there, he
doesn't care if I count it.

52
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:42,625
Bit of a misread on me, I think
he does care if I count it.

53
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:43,917
Or-or was it the nickname?

54
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:45,001
You guys do nicknames?

55
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,709
You guys don't do nicknames.

56
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,542
Are you kidding me? Nicknames are
like the heart of team camaraderie.

57
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:54,333
Huh, you guys are in luck,
nicknames are like my superpower.

58
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:55,750
I've been giving 'em out
since peewee football.

59
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:56,667
Yeah, bro,

60
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:58,083
these guys are a
little bit on edge.

61
00:04:58,084 --> 00:04:59,333
I'm gonna take the edge off.

62
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:00,083
Okay,

63
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:01,167
Bald Eagle,

64
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,418
like the one from the Muppets.

65
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,625
Toothpick.

66
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:06,167
There's a double meaning.
You'll figure it out.

67
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:07,000
Uh,

68
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:08,876
Tomb Raider, because I just...

69
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:11,542
I just feel like you'll
haunt me long after I'm dead.

70
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:17,751
Uh...

71
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:22,293
Full disclosure, there's
a lot going on here, uh...

72
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:24,833
I'm drawn to "Graffiti"

73
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:27,209
'cause it looks like some
teenagers vandalized your face.

74
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,042
That's not it.

75
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:30,917
It's just a start for
me, but I got you.

76
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:31,793
Bro,

77
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:33,793
can you be serious
for one second?

78
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,708
Have you given any more
thought to my plan?

79
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:39,209
Like, one more mission,
five times the money?

80
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:41,333
Can't do it. I've already
done way too much.

81
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:44,208
You're telling me this place couldn't
use more money to fix things up?

82
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,126
Don't start.

83
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:47,250
Yeah, well, it's a big job.

84
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:48,500
- No.
- Moving target.

85
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:49,208
No.

86
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:50,917
And it's for Unicorp, bro.

87
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:51,917
Not interested.

88
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,876
You remember that rebel attack
on Area Seven, don't you?

89
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:57,751
When five of our
guys got popped.

90
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,751
This is the son of a
bitch who armed them.

91
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,875
And right now

92
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:06,625
a team of mercenaries is escorting
this dirtbag back to China.

93
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:07,958
You wanna take on the Chinese?

94
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,959
No, no, no. It's
not the Chinese.

95
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:12,875
It's an international
criminal, all right?

96
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:15,000
She's being extracted
on the Highway of Death

97
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,542
back to the Green Zone.

98
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,823
Big Dog, come on.

99
00:06:18,293 --> 00:06:19,876
Stay there, I'll pick you up.

100
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:22,418
Highway of Death?

101
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:24,833
The most dangerous
road in the country.

102
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:25,918
You know that.

103
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:28,181
You're an idiot for
even thinking about it.

104
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:31,750
Yeah, Dad would've
done it, though.

105
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:39,209
That was low.

106
00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:43,293
Even for you.

107
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:55,668
Keep your eye on the ball, okay?

108
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,333
Almost, almost.

109
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:01,293
Now let's let it
rip. Hit the mitt.

110
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:03,084
Whoa.

111
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:05,126
Fantastic.

112
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:12,834
You got it, Funhouse, come on.

113
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:15,876
Hey, Soraya.

114
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:18,168
Hello, Owen.

115
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:21,376
You look beautiful today.

116
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:23,542
What? No!

117
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,667
I hope you don't mind me
saying, but that, um, abaya,

118
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:29,042
it really makes
your, your skin glow.

119
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:30,376
Owen, stop.

120
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:33,375
Always working.

121
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:34,875
No harder than you, my friend.

122
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,584
So what about the pipe?

123
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,501
It's bone dry.

124
00:07:42,084 --> 00:07:43,458
And you're wasting your time.

125
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:44,626
Pump's rusted.

126
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:47,042
Pipe's disconnected.

127
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:56,001
Damn, I hate this company.

128
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,292
Well, I hate we
don't have water.

129
00:07:58,293 --> 00:07:59,376
Yeah.

130
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:00,583
I mean, I have a little.

131
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:03,064
I got buckets and charcoal, so
we bring a little at a time, but

132
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,667
it's not enough. I mean,
they built that dam.

133
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:07,268
They cut this place off.

134
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:11,583
If you want, I can go talk
to Unicorp headquarters

135
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:13,500
but you know how that goes.

136
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:14,917
You want us to
bribe 'em for water?

137
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:17,459
There's only one thing
more expensive than oil.

138
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:19,583
Water.

139
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:22,042
The more desperate,
the more expensive.

140
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,001
How much?

141
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:27,000
Probably a 100 grand.

142
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:31,750
I'm sorry, I'm doing all I can.

143
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:33,293
It's just that it...

144
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:43,918
I'll get a crew together if
you guys can get the money.

145
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:46,001
Okay.

146
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:47,876
Do what you can.

147
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:51,723
This place is gonna
die without water, man.

148
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:57,218
The weather
conditions are clear.

149
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:01,083
Let them know we'll
arrive at the Green Zone in two groups.

150
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:02,833
One at nine a.m., the
second at four p.m.

151
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,000
Got it.

152
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,293
English, please.

153
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:06,918
<i>What about air recon?</i>

154
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:10,042
Your primary and secondary routes
to the Green Zone are hostile.

155
00:09:10,043 --> 00:09:12,875
<i>Sir, all the other
options are rebel controlled.</i>

156
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,208
Then we're still taking
the Highway of Death.

157
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:18,543
It's the fastest way

158
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:20,333
from here to the Green Zone.

159
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:21,876
Nonstop, eight hours.

160
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:35,418
Chris,

161
00:09:36,251 --> 00:09:39,043
where are we going
to get the $100,000?

162
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:43,501
I'll think of something.

163
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,293
Okay.

164
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:00,792
Sector four, ready.

165
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:02,167
Sector three, ready.

166
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:04,542
Sector two, ready.

167
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:06,001
Sector one, ready.

168
00:10:08,043 --> 00:10:09,208
We
are shutting down.

169
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,293
Got it.

170
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,668
Professor,
we need the dongle.

171
00:10:29,543 --> 00:10:30,823
You feeling better?

172
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:32,711
Not really.

173
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:39,169
System off.

174
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:42,750
- Mei, hold my bag for me.
- Okay.

175
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:44,084
Be careful.

176
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:48,501
Professor,
we must go right away.

177
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:51,042
Get
ready, everyone, we're going!

178
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,458
- Do a head count.
- Yes, sir.

179
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,542
Come on.

180
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:03,959
Follow me.

181
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:05,834
Come on, come on.

182
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,375
Professor, there's
still another seat on bus eight.

183
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:14,375
You can go with your assistant.

184
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:16,250
Excellent. Let's go.

185
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:17,918
But
you are on bus one.

186
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:22,125
Okay.

187
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:23,375
I'll see you in the Green Zone.

188
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:24,668
Please be careful.

189
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:41,293
Dr. Mei.

190
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,084
I saved a seat for you.

191
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:52,168
Shadow Squad.

192
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:56,875
Let's go!

193
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:57,959
Yes, sir.

194
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:10,501
Move out.

195
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:11,876
You hold tight.

196
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:14,084
Okay, let's go.

197
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,043
Commander Luo,

198
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,876
the helicopters are pushing
ahead to the Green Zone.

199
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:37,043
You're on your own now.

200
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:50,500
Radio check one.

201
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,584
<i>Two check.</i>

202
00:12:52,793 --> 00:12:53,501
<i>Three check.</i>

203
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:54,751
<i>Four check.</i>

204
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:56,834
<i>Five check.</i>

205
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:58,376
<i>Six check.</i>

206
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:00,418
<i>Seven check.</i>

207
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:01,751
<i>Eight check.</i>

208
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:02,918
<i>Nine check.</i>

209
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:04,584
<i>Ten check.</i>

210
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:06,084
<i>Eleven check.</i>

211
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:22,792
You can't
stand the whole way.

212
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:24,251
Road's bumpy, it's dangerous.

213
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:26,918
I'm fine.

214
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,626
More
stubborn than your mom.

215
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:37,751
So you
still remember her?

216
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,084
The Highway of Death.

217
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:06,918
It looks so tragic.

218
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:11,417
A lot of people
died here during the war.

219
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:12,918
It's still dangerous here.

220
00:14:13,584 --> 00:14:14,664
Don't worry, we'll be okay.

221
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:17,543
Watch the sides.

222
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:18,959
Prepare yourselves.

223
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:23,668
Please sit down.

224
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:25,168
Hm?

225
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,959
Seatbelt please.

226
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,479
There's
a minefield ahead.

227
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:03,904
I can
see them coming!

228
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,501
I
know. Don't worry.

229
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:11,251
Stay in formation. Be careful.

230
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:15,458
What are you doing?

231
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:16,876
There's
no mines there.

232
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:02,584
You see?

233
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:04,709
It's all a trap.

234
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:06,543
They want to lure you in

235
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,918
somewhere you think is
safe and take your life.

236
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:31,376
Mei,

237
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:35,043
I'm here to protect you.

238
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:38,209
You are here
to be a hero not for me,

239
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:40,584
but for them.

240
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,001
Your name was
on the evacuation list.

241
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:52,418
So,

242
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:55,709
you brought your team all
the way here to save me

243
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:57,543
just for my forgiveness?

244
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,084
It's not gonna happen.

245
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:01,251
You broke my mom's heart.

246
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:02,750
And mine as well.

247
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:04,168
I'll never forgive you.

248
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:06,667
It was your mom
who took you away from me.

249
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:09,209
That's just because
you never cared about us.

250
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:12,376
My mom was lying
there in the hospital,

251
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,709
she couldn't get out of bed

252
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:19,293
but you never bothered to
visit her, not even once.

253
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,709
How could you be so cruel?

254
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,958
I was on
a top secret mission.

255
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,043
Our country needed me.

256
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:32,318
Our
country needed you?

257
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:33,668
Right.

258
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:36,418
What about me?

259
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:38,793
I was so little.

260
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:42,251
Mom was in the hospital,
she needed you more.

261
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:48,626
But what have you done for us?

262
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,293
As an engineer here,

263
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:01,334
I'm grateful for you.

264
00:18:02,418 --> 00:18:03,418
But as your daughter,

265
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,329
there's nothing left to say.

266
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:12,351
Dragon,
on your one o'clock.

267
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:20,668
Attention, everybody.

268
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:22,626
There's a sandstorm up ahead.

269
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:29,542
QiXing,

270
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,458
didn't you say the
weather was clear?

271
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:33,375
I've been
keeping an eye on the data.

272
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:35,583
It shows the chance of a
sandstorm here is zero.

273
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:38,083
If we don't keep
going, we'll miss our window.

274
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,625
Jing and Yan, close the hatches.

275
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:41,793
We need to get through
as fast as possible.

276
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:08,793
This sandstorm is very unusual.

277
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:13,376
HaiMing.

278
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:16,668
HaiMing?

279
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:19,668
HaiMing, do you copy?

280
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:22,501
I
don't copy either.

281
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:24,299
ShenWei?

282
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:25,751
Yan?

283
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,418
Strange, there is no signal.

284
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,459
Hey, is that...

285
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:33,168
What?

286
00:19:35,168 --> 00:19:36,168
Huh?

287
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,751
Nothing. I thought
I saw something.

288
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:46,542
Should be
close to the target.

289
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:47,751
Tell me what you see.

290
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:49,918
There it is.

291
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:52,543
Our objective plus
four of her core crew.

292
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:55,625
Toothpick, Tomb
Raider, we're on the X.

293
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:57,708
Scribblehead, extract
and drop. Let's go.

294
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:01,501
My name is Knox.

295
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,375
How is it
causing so much interference?

296
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:22,876
Get back on the main road.

297
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,750
You having fun yet?

298
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:30,293
Just keep your head on a swivel.

299
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:07,667
Everybody down!

300
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:08,833
Nobody move!

301
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,958
On the ground!

302
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:10,917
You, got a hearing problem?

303
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,292
On the floor, don't move!

304
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:14,500
On the ground!

305
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:16,334
All clear. Lane secure.

306
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:20,083
Down, down, get down.

307
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:21,084
You, wanna die?

308
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,334
On the floor! Don't move.

309
00:22:21,501 --> 00:22:22,821
Where
are they going?

310
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:30,959
Strange...

311
00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:40,750
ShenWei?

312
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:42,125
Yan, HaiMing?

313
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:43,209
Does anyone copy?

314
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:51,834
Gather round!

315
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:54,584
Hurry up!

316
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,458
Why isn't
anyone answering?

317
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:00,500
Our comms went
completely down just now.

318
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:01,833
What
about you guys?

319
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,418
There's
nothing. No signal.

320
00:23:04,376 --> 00:23:05,417
Are
all the buses here?

321
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,167
I saw bus
eight leave the convoy.

322
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:08,125
Where did it go?

323
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:09,001
East.

324
00:23:11,543 --> 00:23:13,250
- Where is Yan?
- Bus 11 is gone too.

325
00:23:13,251 --> 00:23:14,583
What's
wrong with you?

326
00:23:14,584 --> 00:23:16,626
You lost two entire
buses in a sandstorm.

327
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:21,167
That
storm is not natural.

328
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,251
Hurry
up, hurry up, go!

329
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:27,543
Go. Go.

330
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:31,083
Hey, these the guys
that armed Area Seven?

331
00:23:31,084 --> 00:23:32,292
- Yeah, why?
- These guys?

332
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:35,292
What's a criminal supposed
to look like, bro, huh?

333
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:36,792
You remember Typhoid Mary?

334
00:23:36,793 --> 00:23:38,043
She killed like a 100 people.

335
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,876
Yeah, she was just a cook.

336
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:44,543
We got it!

337
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:46,334
Dragon!

338
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:49,625
Captain Azir, we lost two buses.

339
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:51,375
<i>We need both helicopters here.</i>

340
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:52,708
Copy, Commander.

341
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:54,250
We are circling back.

342
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:55,334
Okay.

343
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:57,167
- Take the second helicopter.
- Okay.

344
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:58,750
- Follow me.
- Where?

345
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:00,125
You're
familiar with this desert.

346
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:01,958
Isn't this part of your job?

347
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:02,875
Yeah,

348
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,542
I have surveyed this area
with Professor Cheng before.

349
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,542
Why?

350
00:24:05,543 --> 00:24:07,625
I need your help
finding the missing buses.

351
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:08,709
I...

352
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:13,678
Don't worry,
I will protect you.

353
00:24:45,543 --> 00:24:46,709
It's breaking up.

354
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,792
This doesn't happen
in the canyons.

355
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:50,876
Look!

356
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:03,958
ShenWei,

357
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:05,626
the sandstorm was man-made.

358
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:09,668
They used jet engines
to push the sand.

359
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:11,333
<i>Copy.</i>

360
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:12,418
Azir,

361
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:14,084
head north.

362
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:27,418
Dragon, Dragon!

363
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:29,418
Dragon!

364
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:31,293
Can you hear me?

365
00:25:32,418 --> 00:25:34,292
We were ambushed by mercenaries.

366
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:35,625
Who were they?

367
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:37,543
Americans.
They were very fast.

368
00:25:38,209 --> 00:25:39,043
Very organized.

369
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:40,959
You stand down.

370
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,876
Connect with HaiMing.

371
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,459
Copy.

372
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:52,334
HaiMing,

373
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,084
can you get a GPS
position on bus eight?

374
00:25:56,126 --> 00:25:58,125
GPS
can't locate it.

375
00:25:58,126 --> 00:25:59,209
ShenWei,

376
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:01,334
scan a 10-mile radius

377
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,875
for any fast-moving vehicles.

378
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:05,959
Report if you find anything.

379
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:07,834
Copy.

380
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:09,918
Circle around.

381
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:22,917
What's your problem?

382
00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:24,418
I knew I couldn't trust you.

383
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,001
Bro, you are paranoid.

384
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:29,250
Shit. Incoming!

385
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:34,376
Cover fire.

386
00:26:35,084 --> 00:26:36,958
Must be them! Go, go, go.

387
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:37,709
Copy!

388
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:53,500
Dragon Luo,

389
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:57,043
there's suspicious mercenaries
and they're firing on us!

390
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:00,501
Let's go. Head east.

391
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:02,709
Yan,

392
00:27:03,084 --> 00:27:05,484
join up with the rest of the
team and head to the Green Zone.

393
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,167
I'll meet you there.

394
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,000
Copy.

395
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,042
HaiMing,

396
00:27:09,043 --> 00:27:10,376
get the convoy rolling.

397
00:27:11,293 --> 00:27:12,084
Copy.

398
00:27:55,584 --> 00:27:56,750
I just lost my lead.

399
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:58,250
Etch-a-Sketch, you're
up, you take point.

400
00:27:58,251 --> 00:27:59,376
It's Knox!

401
00:28:12,376 --> 00:28:14,625
Cyclops, push ahead
and set up an ambush.

402
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,209
My name is Knox!

403
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:25,917
Shit!

404
00:28:33,793 --> 00:28:35,043
He's moving too fast.

405
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:38,000
Hold on!

406
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:44,542
Tomb Raider, cover me now.

407
00:28:44,543 --> 00:28:46,375
Tramp Stamp, I'm
drawing this helo away

408
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:48,084
and you stay behind
and take it out!

409
00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:56,208
We need to keep going.

410
00:28:56,209 --> 00:28:58,293
We got no chance with
that thing in the air.

411
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:03,833
You take care of the bird.

412
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:05,375
I'll get 'em to
the exchange site.

413
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,501
Copy!

414
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:12,626
Set.

415
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:19,708
Tramp Stamp, take it out.

416
00:29:29,543 --> 00:29:30,293
I'm out.

417
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:34,501
I'm out.

418
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:38,251
We're clear.

419
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:42,751
Goddammit, Knox, take your shot!

420
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:53,458
I got it.

421
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,659
We're going down.

422
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,376
Commander.

423
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:47,959
Look.

424
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:51,959
Go!

425
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:05,934
You're
going down like this?

426
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:07,751
Be careful.

427
00:31:45,918 --> 00:31:46,917
Five.

428
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:48,001
Wei.

429
00:31:48,376 --> 00:31:49,083
Dragon Luo,

430
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:50,584
they took five people with them.

431
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:53,209
Azir, five missing.

432
00:31:53,793 --> 00:31:54,834
I need Mei down here.

433
00:31:56,126 --> 00:31:57,126
What's going on?

434
00:31:57,876 --> 00:31:58,876
Who hired us?

435
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,292
- Unicorp.
- Don't lie to me, Henry!

436
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:02,333
What are you mixed up in?

437
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:04,459
Go easy on him, Chris.

438
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:10,668
It's like you said,

439
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:13,083
no one works harder than me.

440
00:32:13,084 --> 00:32:14,293
Owen?

441
00:32:25,918 --> 00:32:26,876
Hey, Mei,

442
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:29,000
they took Professor
Cheng and her assistant.

443
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:30,084
What?

444
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,584
Professor Ying Cheng.

445
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,001
Finally.

446
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,626
I'm very, very thankful
you could make it.

447
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:48,043
Have we met?

448
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:51,001
No, I'm afraid I haven't
had the pleasure until now.

449
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:54,543
I hope my men didn't cause
too many problems for you.

450
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:59,126
It was you attacking
our refinery?

451
00:33:00,293 --> 00:33:01,876
Please understand, professor,

452
00:33:02,376 --> 00:33:03,626
it's not personal.

453
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:06,043
Knox!

454
00:33:09,876 --> 00:33:10,834
Let's talk.

455
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:15,043
I've been all over this country.

456
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:19,501
You know what I've found?

457
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,251
This isn't a desert.

458
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:26,043
Everything here is a gold mine.

459
00:33:26,876 --> 00:33:28,751
And I'm wiping the
company out, Chris.

460
00:33:29,251 --> 00:33:30,251
What?

461
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,418
I watched them get rich
while I busted my ass off.

462
00:33:35,626 --> 00:33:37,709
Sixteen years of false promises.

463
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:42,501
I even gave up having
a family for them.

464
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:44,793
And for what?

465
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:47,334
Nothing.

466
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:50,209
But now it's my turn.

467
00:33:52,293 --> 00:33:53,583
I'm taking this war private.

468
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:55,126
I'm taking back
what they owe me.

469
00:33:55,668 --> 00:33:56,667
What they owe us.

470
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:59,108
Listen, Owen, what you got going
on here that's your business.

471
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:00,501
It's between you and her.

472
00:34:01,626 --> 00:34:02,626
Hm.

473
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:07,001
Dragon Luo is leading the
Chinese security team.

474
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:09,918
He's gonna come
after the professor.

475
00:34:10,793 --> 00:34:13,625
If you can keep him off my
tail, I can make you rich.

476
00:34:13,626 --> 00:34:15,333
Not interested. I
just want my money.

477
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:16,417
When the job is done.

478
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:18,292
The job is done.
Henry said dropping...

479
00:34:18,293 --> 00:34:19,876
Henry's young and desperate!

480
00:34:22,334 --> 00:34:25,084
You can't trust people
who are desperate.

481
00:34:31,543 --> 00:34:32,584
It's our time.

482
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:36,459
You don't want to pass
this up, my friend.

483
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:38,043
And remember,

484
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:40,001
no money,

485
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:41,376
no water.

486
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:43,584
Selfish son of a bitch.

487
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:45,293
I'm selfish?

488
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:51,334
You know what selfish is?

489
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:53,251
Staying here and hiding.

490
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:57,125
I'm done with you.

491
00:34:57,126 --> 00:34:58,126
Whatever you want.

492
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:00,667
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're
just gonna let him walk?

493
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:01,751
He's your brother.

494
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:03,376
You stop him.

495
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,126
Chris, wait.

496
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:08,750
I-I need to collect our
money and we gotta finish.

497
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:10,167
Get out of here
while you still can.

498
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:13,293
Well, go on then.

499
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:14,834
Quit.

500
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:18,751
Just like you did when
you bailed on our old man.

501
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:22,083
Be at the village at 1600 sharp.

502
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:24,375
Bring the rest of my
money and don't be late.

503
00:35:32,334 --> 00:35:33,334
Owen.

504
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:34,834
We don't need him.

505
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:38,168
I can handle this Dragon
Luo guy on my own.

506
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:40,792
You failed, Henry.

507
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:42,417
That makes me so sad.

508
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:55,209
Stop!

509
00:35:56,209 --> 00:35:57,251
We need the hostages.

510
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:00,584
Idiot.

511
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:11,083
Take him back to the radio tower

512
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:13,375
and make it look like
Chinese payback, okay?

513
00:36:13,376 --> 00:36:16,167
Also, close the loop on Henry's
bullshit with the French.

514
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:18,209
We can't have them
interfering with the plan.

515
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:19,626
Let's go!

516
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:31,750
Hey.

517
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:35,459
Follow that car.

518
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:37,001
Copy, sir.

519
00:37:10,918 --> 00:37:11,792
What's up ahead?

520
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:12,709
I don't know.

521
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:15,750
There's a
village there in Area Four.

522
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:16,834
But it's dangerous.

523
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:19,501
Follow him.

524
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:22,293
We're low on fuel.

525
00:37:22,918 --> 00:37:24,334
I can make it, but that's it.

526
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:28,501
You stay
in the helicopter, okay?

527
00:38:02,668 --> 00:38:03,918
Chris, we play.

528
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:17,918
Almost, bud, almost.

529
00:38:26,626 --> 00:38:27,793
Come on, Henry.

530
00:38:30,626 --> 00:38:31,917
That took a bad
hop, took a bad hop.

531
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:32,917
Oh!

532
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:52,584
You lost?

533
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:57,959
I come for my people.

534
00:39:01,626 --> 00:39:03,043
What are you doing
in my village?

535
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,376
What are you doing
in the desert?

536
00:39:09,168 --> 00:39:10,001
I'm fishing.

537
00:39:10,876 --> 00:39:12,209
What are you doing
in the desert?

538
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:18,959
Hello?

539
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:20,793
I'm fine.

540
00:39:24,043 --> 00:39:26,043
I'm playing baseball
with a <i>bangchui</i>.

541
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,168
I came for my people.

542
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:34,043
You got the wrong guy.

543
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:48,168
Chris, we play.

544
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:00,126
Whoa.

545
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,001
You caught it, Funhouse.
That was awesome.

546
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:17,500
I told you
many times to behave yourself.

547
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:19,168
You will get punished next time.

548
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,875
Chris,
where are you going?

549
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:23,792
I'm going to get our
money. I won't be long.

550
00:40:23,793 --> 00:40:24,708
Okay.

551
00:41:08,584 --> 00:41:09,501
Yo!

552
00:41:58,834 --> 00:42:00,500
See you on the other side, bro.

553
00:43:24,459 --> 00:43:25,668
Why are you following me?

554
00:43:26,459 --> 00:43:27,751
Why are you in the desert?

555
00:43:38,376 --> 00:43:39,625
Oh! Ah!

556
00:43:58,001 --> 00:43:58,793
Ah.

557
00:44:09,418 --> 00:44:10,079
Ah!

558
00:44:26,084 --> 00:44:27,083
You killed my people.

559
00:44:27,084 --> 00:44:29,333
Ahh, I didn't kill anyone.

560
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:30,626
Yes, you did.

561
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,334
Oh!

562
00:44:40,876 --> 00:44:41,626
Ow!

563
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:44,251
Uh!

564
00:44:54,293 --> 00:44:55,250
I know it's you.

565
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:56,418
How?

566
00:44:56,709 --> 00:44:57,876
Fishing in the desert?

567
00:44:58,376 --> 00:44:59,418
Really?

568
00:45:15,459 --> 00:45:16,543
Listen to me.

569
00:45:19,418 --> 00:45:20,876
Listen to me.

570
00:45:22,209 --> 00:45:23,500
You killed my people.

571
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:26,168
They killed your people.
They killed my brother too.

572
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:31,542
What's
going on here?

573
00:45:31,543 --> 00:45:32,376
Where is my money?

574
00:45:33,918 --> 00:45:34,918
Hello.

575
00:45:35,126 --> 00:45:36,125
You speak French?

576
00:45:36,126 --> 00:45:37,209
That's all.

577
00:45:37,584 --> 00:45:39,833
Where is my money, Mr. America?

578
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:40,750
For the weapons.

579
00:45:40,751 --> 00:45:41,834
Looking for money?

580
00:45:42,584 --> 00:45:43,834
Get in line.

581
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,417
Hurry up. I think
they're gonna shoot you.

582
00:45:56,418 --> 00:45:57,333
Why?

583
00:45:57,334 --> 00:45:58,958
Because the first
time I see you,

584
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:00,209
I wanted to shoot you.

585
00:46:06,126 --> 00:46:07,418
Start shooting!

586
00:46:09,043 --> 00:46:09,834
See?

587
00:46:12,293 --> 00:46:13,292
Go!

588
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:23,001
Shit-shit-shit-shit!

589
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:24,917
- Magazine!
- What?!

590
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:26,126
Magazine!

591
00:46:26,793 --> 00:46:27,454
Here!

592
00:46:29,793 --> 00:46:31,625
Hey! Bullets?

593
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:33,208
What kind of bullets?

594
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:34,501
Seven six two.

595
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,251
Seven six two.

596
00:46:37,043 --> 00:46:39,083
Seven six two. Seven six two.

597
00:46:39,084 --> 00:46:41,333
- What are you doing?
- I'm loading for you!

598
00:46:41,334 --> 00:46:42,668
Just give 'em to me!

599
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:44,792
Ah.

600
00:46:44,793 --> 00:46:45,708
Here!

601
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:49,042
Hey!

602
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:50,167
- What?
- Forget it!

603
00:46:50,168 --> 00:46:51,084
Grenade!

604
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:54,750
Give me a grenade!

605
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:55,750
Yeah, grenade.

606
00:46:55,751 --> 00:46:56,833
You get it!

607
00:46:56,834 --> 00:46:58,042
What are you, crazy?

608
00:46:58,043 --> 00:46:59,084
What?

609
00:47:00,043 --> 00:47:00,958
Too dangerous.

610
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:01,792
You're closer.

611
00:47:01,793 --> 00:47:02,583
Me go?

612
00:47:02,584 --> 00:47:03,583
Go!

613
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:04,668
Shit, shit.

614
00:47:10,084 --> 00:47:11,375
Here we go, come on,
come on, come on!

615
00:47:11,376 --> 00:47:12,918
Who killed my people?

616
00:47:13,459 --> 00:47:14,293
What?

617
00:47:15,084 --> 00:47:16,083
Come on.

618
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,583
Who are they?

619
00:47:18,584 --> 00:47:20,667
- It wasn't them.
- What?

620
00:47:20,668 --> 00:47:21,751
Come on.

621
00:47:23,293 --> 00:47:24,833
Hurry up, grenade!

622
00:47:24,834 --> 00:47:26,250
I gotta find it!

623
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:27,168
It's in the bin.

624
00:47:27,918 --> 00:47:29,042
What?

625
00:47:29,043 --> 00:47:30,042
In the bin.

626
00:47:30,043 --> 00:47:31,168
Pull the pin?

627
00:47:32,168 --> 00:47:33,917
Okay, here!

628
00:47:36,043 --> 00:47:37,043
Huh?

629
00:47:39,876 --> 00:47:41,167
Why'd you pull the pin, man?

630
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:42,625
- Pull the pin?
- I said "the bin."

631
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,418
I pulled the pin already.

632
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:48,583
Wait-wait-wait-wait.

633
00:47:48,584 --> 00:47:49,958
What?!

634
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:52,000
I think they're gone.

635
00:47:53,334 --> 00:47:54,376
How do you know?

636
00:47:55,168 --> 00:47:56,459
No more shooting.

637
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:00,293
Take a look.

638
00:48:01,126 --> 00:48:02,083
You look.

639
00:48:02,084 --> 00:48:03,375
- You.
- You look!

640
00:48:03,376 --> 00:48:05,001
You closer.

641
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:10,498
Yeah, I think they're gone.

642
00:48:11,626 --> 00:48:13,001
Don't look one direction.

643
00:48:28,584 --> 00:48:30,125
Who killed my people?

644
00:48:30,126 --> 00:48:31,543
You ever give up?

645
00:48:32,459 --> 00:48:33,376
No. Who are they?

646
00:48:35,168 --> 00:48:36,168
You shoot me,

647
00:48:36,501 --> 00:48:37,621
you're never gonna find out.

648
00:48:38,376 --> 00:48:39,456
Gotta go check on my truck.

649
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:40,918
Hey.

650
00:48:58,209 --> 00:48:59,209
Oh.

651
00:49:02,876 --> 00:49:03,918
You have flat tire.

652
00:49:05,918 --> 00:49:06,668
Ethel.

653
00:49:10,834 --> 00:49:12,042
Your car has a name?

654
00:49:12,043 --> 00:49:13,126
Yeah.

655
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:15,918
Is that weird?

656
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:17,792
Come on.

657
00:49:17,793 --> 00:49:19,501
- Can't leave the weapons.
- Or the bodies.

658
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,418
It's weird.

659
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:29,667
Owen Paddock runs
everything for Unicorp.

660
00:49:29,668 --> 00:49:30,875
He's got your people.

661
00:49:30,876 --> 00:49:32,292
Which company? This company?

662
00:49:32,293 --> 00:49:33,500
No, that one.

663
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:34,375
Get in the car.

664
00:49:34,376 --> 00:49:36,168
Hey, no time! Come
on, come on, come on.

665
00:49:36,751 --> 00:49:38,542
Hey, where's he taken them?

666
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:39,667
I don't know.

667
00:49:39,668 --> 00:49:41,792
But it's too dangerous to
do anything here at night.

668
00:49:41,793 --> 00:49:42,583
Even for you.

669
00:49:56,168 --> 00:49:57,168
By the way,

670
00:49:57,459 --> 00:49:58,459
what's your name?

671
00:50:02,584 --> 00:50:04,344
It's <i>bangchui</i>
, isn't it?

672
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:05,793
Huh?

673
00:50:07,043 --> 00:50:08,403
You
can speak Chinese?

674
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:10,334
Yes, I can.

675
00:50:15,584 --> 00:50:16,584
Let go!

676
00:50:19,168 --> 00:50:20,250
Where you learn Chinese?

677
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:22,792
I was in Shanghai
working for a dead man company.

678
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:23,750
What?

679
00:50:23,751 --> 00:50:25,459
A dead man company.

680
00:50:26,709 --> 00:50:28,251
Dead man company?

681
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:30,293
Yes, private security.

682
00:50:31,918 --> 00:50:34,250
It's
pronounced private security company.

683
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:36,876
Not "funeral parlor".

684
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:40,543
Private security company.
First tone, not third tone.

685
00:50:41,459 --> 00:50:44,542
Private
security company.

686
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:45,918
You speak English!

687
00:50:53,459 --> 00:50:56,292
The refinery is
protected by quantum encryption.

688
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:02,876
It's not happening
without the dongle.

689
00:51:08,209 --> 00:51:09,334
All right, professor,

690
00:51:09,876 --> 00:51:11,543
I need you to get
the oil flowing.

691
00:51:13,376 --> 00:51:14,293
Where's the dongle?

692
00:51:15,126 --> 00:51:16,793
You're gonna steal our oil.

693
00:51:32,584 --> 00:51:36,000
Some of my men, my...
friends have died

694
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:38,918
and their families, they
didn't get anything, so...

695
00:51:40,834 --> 00:51:43,001
I'm just taking back
what they owe us.

696
00:51:44,084 --> 00:51:45,126
You're gonna help me.

697
00:51:46,543 --> 00:51:47,375
You're stealing.

698
00:51:51,293 --> 00:51:53,167
I think everyone is
stealing from this country.

699
00:51:53,168 --> 00:51:54,293
We buy it.

700
00:51:55,959 --> 00:51:57,501
I also need the codes, please.

701
00:52:02,168 --> 00:52:04,293
It's a very complex process

702
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:06,221
and there's not...

703
00:52:10,376 --> 00:52:11,668
Please continue.

704
00:52:19,626 --> 00:52:20,458
Paper.

705
00:52:20,459 --> 00:52:22,750
Yeah, with the codes, right?

706
00:52:22,751 --> 00:52:23,833
Yes.

707
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:25,209
And the dongle?

708
00:52:27,418 --> 00:52:28,209
Dongle.

709
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:33,125
Dongle.

710
00:52:33,126 --> 00:52:34,043
Where are they?

711
00:52:58,001 --> 00:53:00,084
Why would I kill you
when I can kill your son?

712
00:53:02,751 --> 00:53:05,292
No!

713
00:53:05,293 --> 00:53:06,709
Everything in my bag.

714
00:53:07,168 --> 00:53:08,125
Where's the bag?

715
00:53:08,126 --> 00:53:09,292
No, I don't know where is it!

716
00:53:09,293 --> 00:53:10,250
Where's the bag?

717
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:11,958
It's not with me right now.

718
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:14,750
I don't know where is
it! No, please, please!

719
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:17,125
No, please trust me...

720
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:18,292
I'm so sorry.

721
00:53:18,293 --> 00:53:19,542
It's not with me.

722
00:53:19,543 --> 00:53:20,459
Track her phone!

723
00:53:26,376 --> 00:53:27,500
Her phone.

724
00:53:27,501 --> 00:53:28,668
It's in her bag.

725
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:32,959
Pho...

726
00:53:36,584 --> 00:53:37,584
Go get the bag.

727
00:53:45,709 --> 00:53:46,709
Hello?

728
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:49,917
Big dog!

729
00:53:49,918 --> 00:53:53,792
That's right, the big dog is back and
performing his brand new hit single,

730
00:53:53,793 --> 00:53:54,917
Hello?

731

- Yeah. What's that?

784
00:56:00,543 --> 00:56:02,250
That's a-a-a different bulldog?

785
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:04,167
- Young bulldog.
- A younger bulldog.

786
00:56:04,168 --> 00:56:05,168
What is that?

787
00:56:06,709 --> 00:56:08,333
It looks like you're
hanging from a wire.

788
00:56:08,334 --> 00:56:10,792
Let me guess: you're
suspended from a building.

789
00:56:10,793 --> 00:56:12,208
Giraffe.

790
00:56:12,209 --> 00:56:14,334
- A giraffe?
- Yeah, what's-what's that?

791
00:56:14,959 --> 00:56:16,708
You-you look like a statue.

792
00:56:16,709 --> 00:56:18,208
No, human. Just me.

793
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:20,458
Oh, that's pretty good,
'cause I mean that was real.

794
00:56:20,459 --> 00:56:22,250
That was good... You were
actually a human being.

795
00:56:22,251 --> 00:56:23,626
He's good. He's got a good bit.

796
00:56:24,876 --> 00:56:26,375
Time for the meal.

797
00:56:26,376 --> 00:56:27,333
- Good work.
- Yeah. Yeah.

798
00:56:27,334 --> 00:56:28,792
- Excellent.
- You do it every day?

799
00:56:28,793 --> 00:56:30,083
Every day.

800
00:56:30,084 --> 00:56:31,917
Let's let the kids eat.

801
00:56:33,043 --> 00:56:34,083
See ya.

802
00:56:34,084 --> 00:56:35,500
Big dog, big dog.

803
00:56:35,501 --> 00:56:36,584
Yes.

804
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:45,334
Oh.

805
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:47,751
Thank you.

806
00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:58,126
Why take two buses?

807
00:56:59,084 --> 00:57:00,376
You only needed bus eight.

808
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:01,793
Distraction.

809
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:05,543
Hey, man, your friend
dropped her book.

810
00:57:06,168 --> 00:57:09,667
I'm no idiot, I don't see any
chemistry there between you two

811
00:57:09,668 --> 00:57:11,917
so I figured I
would use the book

812
00:57:11,918 --> 00:57:13,292
as like an in, you know.

813
00:57:13,293 --> 00:57:15,813
I mean, I put my number in the
back or something, 'cause I mean,

814
00:57:16,459 --> 00:57:17,459
look at her, man.

815
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,126
She is hot.

816
00:57:20,459 --> 00:57:21,458
That booty.

817
00:57:21,459 --> 00:57:23,418
I mean, I'm no freak
kind of guy but...

818
00:57:25,584 --> 00:57:26,668
She's my daughter.

819
00:57:27,251 --> 00:57:28,251
Huh...

820
00:57:30,876 --> 00:57:32,334
Uh, of course she is. I...

821
00:57:32,918 --> 00:57:34,751
You... Now that you
mention it, she...

822
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:36,584
She looks just like you.

823
00:57:38,043 --> 00:57:39,250
She is your daughter.

824
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:40,500
How did I not see that?

825
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:50,209
Mei and I,

826
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:51,834
complicated.

827
00:57:53,876 --> 00:57:54,959
Her mother died.

828
00:57:56,334 --> 00:57:57,793
For Mei, maybe I'm dead, too.

829
00:57:58,543 --> 00:58:00,001
Wait, you said
you never give up.

830
00:58:02,293 --> 00:58:03,293
In war, yes.

831
00:58:03,918 --> 00:58:05,543
In life, not so easy.

832
00:58:09,418 --> 00:58:10,418
Why are you here?

833
00:58:11,626 --> 00:58:12,626
Yeah.

834
00:58:14,126 --> 00:58:15,766
Me and my brother used
to work for my dad.

835
00:58:17,043 --> 00:58:18,458
Private contractors?

836
00:58:18,459 --> 00:58:19,751
Yeah. Damn good too.

837
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:21,751
Every one of us, Special Ops.

838
00:58:22,334 --> 00:58:24,694
Two years ago, my old man got
a job on the Highway of Death.

839
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:26,583
Turned it down.

840
00:58:26,584 --> 00:58:28,126
First time I ever
heard him say it.

841
00:58:29,376 --> 00:58:30,918
So I convinced him to take it.

842
00:58:32,293 --> 00:58:35,167
And we... drove right
into a rebel ambush.

843
00:58:35,168 --> 00:58:36,583
Forty-eight hour firefight.

844
00:58:36,584 --> 00:58:39,833
In the end, I... hatched up a
plan to get us out of there.

845
00:58:39,834 --> 00:58:41,501
I-I-I needed to hold the line

846
00:58:42,043 --> 00:58:43,084
so my dad could move.

847
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:45,959
But I signaled to him
that I needed to move.

848
00:58:47,418 --> 00:58:49,876
And we both moved
at the same time.

849
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:52,043
And everybody got wasted.

850
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:54,511
My dad got killed right
there in front of me.

851
00:58:57,459 --> 00:58:58,625
Your father and your men,

852
00:58:58,626 --> 00:59:00,793
they died because
it was their time.

853
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:03,793
This is the life we choose.

854
00:59:04,543 --> 00:59:06,167
Don't look for reasons why.

855
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:07,709
Yeah, before, man, we...

856
00:59:08,876 --> 00:59:11,001
fought for honor or
a flag or something.

857
00:59:12,751 --> 00:59:14,168
I fight for my family,

858
00:59:14,834 --> 00:59:17,543
my people, my
country. That's all.

859
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:19,792
They were my family.

860
00:59:19,793 --> 00:59:21,709
The village is your family now.

861
00:59:28,584 --> 00:59:30,709
By the way, what's
your real name?

862
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,668
It's not <i>bangchui</i>.

863
00:59:35,459 --> 00:59:36,459
It's Chris.

864
00:59:45,168 --> 00:59:46,167
Sh!

865
00:59:50,126 --> 00:59:51,792
Get the kids in
the classroom, now.

866
00:59:51,793 --> 00:59:52,501
Okay.

867
00:59:54,793 --> 00:59:55,667
Go, go, go!

868
00:59:55,668 --> 00:59:57,000
Come on, come on, hurry.

869
01:00:04,959 --> 01:00:06,292
You go high, I'll go low.

870
01:00:06,293 --> 01:00:07,209
Okay.

871
01:01:01,126 --> 01:01:02,834
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

872
01:01:04,334 --> 01:01:05,543
Hey!

873
01:01:14,918 --> 01:01:16,667
I'm okay. You okay?

874
01:01:16,668 --> 01:01:18,793
- Get off me.
- Okay.

875
01:01:23,084 --> 01:01:24,917
Did you say, "I go
high, you go low?"

876
01:01:24,918 --> 01:01:26,458
I did go low.

877
01:01:26,459 --> 01:01:27,542
Then I went high.

878
01:01:27,543 --> 01:01:30,583
Okay, from now on,
no more talking.

879
01:01:30,584 --> 01:01:31,668
Hand signal.

880
01:01:33,418 --> 01:01:34,543
You know hand signal, right?

881
01:01:42,293 --> 01:01:43,376
Shit.

882
01:02:05,209 --> 01:02:06,084
Good signal, huh?

883
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:10,501
Hey.

884
01:02:14,334 --> 01:02:15,793
Six, six.

885
01:02:16,543 --> 01:02:17,917
Six o'clock!

886
01:02:20,959 --> 01:02:21,917
Can't you read the signal?

887
01:02:21,918 --> 01:02:23,125
What signal?

888
01:02:23,126 --> 01:02:24,126
Let's go.

889
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:30,833
Don't you know what this means?

890
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:33,792
Yeah, call you, have a beer,
relax. What do you mean?

891
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:36,083
One, two, three, four,
five, six, six o'clock.

892
01:02:36,084 --> 01:02:39,126
How does that mean six?
Just say, "Behind you."

893
01:02:40,126 --> 01:02:42,000
This time you go high, I go low.

894
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:43,959
Go!

895
01:02:44,709 --> 01:02:45,792
Remember, <i>bangchui</i>.

896
01:02:57,501 --> 01:02:58,584
Shit! Ah!

897
01:03:52,126 --> 01:03:53,126
Chris!

898
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:58,459
Give me your phone.

899
01:03:59,084 --> 01:04:00,334
The phone! Gimme the phone!

900
01:04:09,668 --> 01:04:11,334
Hey, you looking for this?

901
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:42,500
Looks like we got ourselves
an old-fashioned standoff.

902
01:04:42,501 --> 01:04:44,833
Look, here's your
tracking device

903
01:04:44,834 --> 01:04:47,459
but you don't know where the girl
is and you're not gonna find her.

904
01:04:57,043 --> 01:04:58,750
I'm only here for the bag.

905
01:04:58,751 --> 01:04:59,876
The bag?

906
01:05:02,293 --> 01:05:04,168
Hey, where are you going?

907
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:07,208
Ah, no, no!

908
01:05:07,209 --> 01:05:08,209
What are you doing?

909
01:05:09,043 --> 01:05:10,043
Chris!

910
01:05:28,668 --> 01:05:29,583
Hey.

911
01:05:29,584 --> 01:05:30,958
What are you doing?

912
01:05:30,959 --> 01:05:32,333
This is my family!

913
01:05:32,334 --> 01:05:34,417
I protect this village!

914
01:05:34,418 --> 01:05:35,875
If they want that bag,

915
01:05:35,876 --> 01:05:37,458
I'll just give them that bag.

916
01:05:37,459 --> 01:05:38,750
You speak...

917
01:05:38,751 --> 01:05:40,083
You
can speak Chinese?

918
01:05:40,084 --> 01:05:41,751
Yes, that's how
mad I am right now.

919
01:05:51,168 --> 01:05:53,042
What's so important
about that bag anyway?

920
01:05:53,043 --> 01:05:55,833
The bag has the USB
key and the passwords

921
01:05:55,834 --> 01:05:58,001
to open the flow
from the refinery.

922
01:05:58,501 --> 01:05:59,626
How much oil?

923
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:01,376
Millions of barrels.

924
01:06:01,918 --> 01:06:02,750
Yeah, who cares?

925
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:06,625
To get that much oil out of the
refinery they'd need like... 500 trucks

926
01:06:06,626 --> 01:06:08,250
and then they gotta
drive it to the coast.

927
01:06:08,251 --> 01:06:09,668
There is an underground network

928
01:06:10,293 --> 01:06:12,250
that flows across the country.

929
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:13,875
That's what those pipes are for?

930
01:06:16,709 --> 01:06:17,709
They use the pipes

931
01:06:18,709 --> 01:06:19,793
and fill tankers.

932
01:06:20,459 --> 01:06:23,043
Each tanker holds a 100 million
in oil. That would make it...

933
01:06:23,626 --> 01:06:25,792
The biggest oil
heist in history.

934
01:06:25,793 --> 01:06:27,376
We gotta get to the refinery.

935
01:06:28,126 --> 01:06:30,751
But we need something that
can drive through the gate.

936
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:32,751
I got something.

937
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:36,000
You in position yet?

938
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:38,125
We're on the
station. Standing by.

939
01:06:38,126 --> 01:06:39,209
<i>Copy.</i>

940
01:06:39,876 --> 01:06:41,542
<i>Gentlemen,
prepare to dock.</i>

941
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:46,292
I'm coming too!

942
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:48,125
I know the refinery
better than you do.

943
01:06:48,126 --> 01:06:49,251
I can help you guys.

944
01:06:50,084 --> 01:06:51,458
It's
dangerous there.

945
01:06:51,459 --> 01:06:52,876
You should wait here.

946
01:06:58,418 --> 01:07:00,084
I promise, I'll
come back for you.

947
01:07:01,543 --> 01:07:02,625
Fine.

948
01:07:02,626 --> 01:07:03,751
Be careful.

949
01:07:06,668 --> 01:07:08,000
The refinery is very flammable.

950
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:09,168
Don't use guns.

951
01:07:10,168 --> 01:07:12,125
You have to remember
never to use guns.

952
01:07:12,126 --> 01:07:13,209
Okay.

953
01:07:16,126 --> 01:07:17,000
- Take it s...
- Shut up.

954
01:07:17,001 --> 01:07:19,001
Okay, you're right,
you're right.

955
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:26,751
Hey, put your seat belt on.

956
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:28,834
Safety first.

957
01:07:38,543 --> 01:07:40,376
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

958
01:07:41,626 --> 01:07:43,459
Slow

959
01:07:44,209 --> 01:07:45,876
and put in the hole.

960
01:07:49,084 --> 01:07:50,959
Yeah, see? So easy.

961
01:07:52,793 --> 01:07:53,876
You happy?

962
01:07:54,459 --> 01:07:55,458
Happy.

963
01:07:55,459 --> 01:07:56,417
We can go.

964
01:07:56,418 --> 01:07:57,501
Let's go.

965
01:08:44,334 --> 01:08:45,334
Get working.

966
01:08:47,751 --> 01:08:48,709
Now.

967
01:09:00,126 --> 01:09:01,584
Fingerprint, please.

968
01:09:06,543 --> 01:09:07,543
And passcode.

969
01:09:13,418 --> 01:09:14,418
Seven, nine,

970
01:09:15,501 --> 01:09:16,458
four, two.

971
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:29,376
I hear it
turning on. Start filling!

972
01:09:33,293 --> 01:09:34,376
It's flowing.

973
01:09:35,168 --> 01:09:36,168
We're a go.

974
01:09:53,126 --> 01:09:54,917
It'll take 24 hours.

975
01:09:54,918 --> 01:09:56,001
I know.

976
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:57,751
I'm not an idiot.

977
01:09:59,251 --> 01:10:02,042
Let's fill the trucks. Get moving.
-They're being filled.

978
01:10:02,043 --> 01:10:04,250
Once we cross into
the demilitarized zone

979
01:10:04,251 --> 01:10:05,292
they can't touch us.

980
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:16,667
Enemy approaching!
Enemy approaching!

981
01:10:16,668 --> 01:10:18,251
Fire!

982
01:10:28,293 --> 01:10:29,043
Hey!

983
01:11:00,168 --> 01:11:01,376
Oil truck!

984
01:11:25,418 --> 01:11:26,626
Follow me.

985
01:11:51,751 --> 01:11:52,584
Ah.

986
01:11:59,376 --> 01:12:01,458
Sorry. See?

987
01:12:10,084 --> 01:12:11,500
What are you doing?

988
01:12:11,501 --> 01:12:13,000
So they can't stop it.

989
01:12:13,001 --> 01:12:14,168
We're rolling out.

990
01:12:15,876 --> 01:12:17,751
You stay here and
watch the hostages.

991
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:20,209
But kill them once
the tankers are full.

992
01:12:49,584 --> 01:12:50,750
Jump!

993
01:12:50,751 --> 01:12:51,918
I can't jump.

994
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:55,168
Hold on!

995
01:12:57,209 --> 01:12:58,418
Whoo!

996
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:00,751
Thank you.

997
01:13:04,126 --> 01:13:05,043
Yah!

998
01:13:07,126 --> 01:13:08,668
Dragon Luo!

999
01:13:11,334 --> 01:13:12,834
It's an honor to meet you.

1000
01:13:14,876 --> 01:13:16,751
It's a shame you have
to do this on your own.

1001
01:13:17,876 --> 01:13:18,959
I'm not alone.

1002
01:13:38,834 --> 01:13:39,834
Oh!

1003
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:43,458
- There's a...
- Huh?

1004
01:13:43,459 --> 01:13:45,042
- Few more. You'll be fine.
- What?

1005
01:13:45,043 --> 01:13:46,708
Come up when you're done.

1006
01:14:05,168 --> 01:14:06,043
Help them.

1007
01:14:10,459 --> 01:14:11,459
Ah!

1008
01:14:52,876 --> 01:14:53,917
I got Skullface.

1009
01:14:53,918 --> 01:14:55,543
All right.

1010
01:14:56,084 --> 01:14:57,626
Professor, let's go!

1011
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:02,209
Hurry up!

1012
01:15:29,251 --> 01:15:30,583
Hey, magazine.

1013
01:15:30,584 --> 01:15:32,084
Magazine. Catch!

1014
01:15:33,751 --> 01:15:35,084
Really?

1015
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:38,626
Come on.

1016
01:15:40,543 --> 01:15:41,626
Clear.

1017
01:16:26,834 --> 01:16:27,625
Hey, Knox,

1018
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:29,917
I've been racking my
brain this whole time

1019
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:32,375
to try to think of a
perfect nickname for you.

1020
01:16:32,376 --> 01:16:33,709
Sharpie Head or

1021
01:16:34,334 --> 01:16:35,834
One-Eyed Trouser Snake

1022
01:16:36,459 --> 01:16:37,584
Daddy Issues...

1023
01:16:38,793 --> 01:16:40,750
But I just figured out

1024
01:16:40,751 --> 01:16:42,168
right now

1025
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:45,751
the perfect nickname for you.

1026
01:16:48,584 --> 01:16:49,668
Dead Man.

1027
01:16:50,668 --> 01:16:52,583
You know why?

1028
01:16:52,584 --> 01:16:53,667
'Cause you out of bullets.

1029
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:11,042
You go, I got this.

1030
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:12,043
- You sure?
- Sure!

1031
01:17:12,834 --> 01:17:13,918
All right.

1032
01:17:14,626 --> 01:17:15,626
Hey!

1033
01:17:17,543 --> 01:17:19,333
Everyone head out to the DMZ.

1034
01:17:29,959 --> 01:17:31,168
Let's go.

1035
01:17:58,501 --> 01:17:59,500
That settles it.

1036
01:18:00,584 --> 01:18:02,376
More cardio starting Monday.

1037
01:18:03,126 --> 01:18:04,000
Ah...

1038
01:18:08,043 --> 01:18:09,084
Susie?

1039
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:12,126
That's my truck.

1040
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:18,667
I'm gonna kill him.

1041
01:18:19,668 --> 01:18:21,468
I swear I'm gonna kill
him. I don't want to...

1042
01:18:23,793 --> 01:18:24,625
Mei?

1043
01:18:24,626 --> 01:18:25,833
Where's my father?

1044
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:27,126
Why are you driving Susie?

1045
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:29,125
Who?

1046
01:18:29,126 --> 01:18:30,250
Stay in the car.

1047
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:33,792
Let's go.

1048
01:18:40,876 --> 01:18:41,751
Sorry.

1049
01:18:44,418 --> 01:18:45,709
Drive.

1050
01:19:00,293 --> 01:19:02,543
You keep a machine
gun under the seat?

1051
01:19:03,668 --> 01:19:04,668
American.

1052
01:19:05,543 --> 01:19:06,543
Guns everywhere.

1053
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,084
Professor, leave now.

1054
01:19:41,751 --> 01:19:42,959
Easy, easy.

1055
01:19:43,668 --> 01:19:44,833
Oh!

1056
01:19:44,834 --> 01:19:46,209
There goes the new clutch.

1057
01:19:46,876 --> 01:19:48,334
Shift. Shift.

1058
01:19:49,043 --> 01:19:51,043
Yes, I'm trying, but

1059
01:19:51,876 --> 01:19:53,418
the transmission is loose.

1060
01:19:54,209 --> 01:19:55,209
Loose?

1061
01:19:55,918 --> 01:19:57,542
Don't listen to her, Susie.

1062
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:58,917
Hold on.

1063
01:20:08,709 --> 01:20:09,959
Oh!

1064
01:20:32,751 --> 01:20:34,126
Contact, six o'clock.

1065
01:20:42,376 --> 01:20:44,126
How do you work these?

1066
01:20:53,459 --> 01:20:54,583
Start swerving.

1067
01:21:01,001 --> 01:21:02,668
Oh, Chris.

1068
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:21,543
Ah!

1069
01:21:32,376 --> 01:21:33,293
Yah!

1070
01:21:36,376 --> 01:21:37,583
Hyah!

1071
01:21:37,584 --> 01:21:38,668
Ooh!

1072
01:21:54,418 --> 01:21:55,459
Oh.

1073
01:21:59,834 --> 01:22:00,751
Yah!

1074
01:22:05,876 --> 01:22:06,709
Yah!

1075
01:22:07,626 --> 01:22:08,417
Aah!

1076
01:22:17,001 --> 01:22:18,126
Shit!

1077
01:22:18,418 --> 01:22:19,833
Aw, come on.

1078
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:20,959
We're out of bullets.

1079
01:22:25,209 --> 01:22:26,543
They're out.

1080
01:22:27,793 --> 01:22:29,751
Take her off the road, now!

1081
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:33,793
Let's see if she's
ready now, Chris.

1082
01:22:38,501 --> 01:22:40,042
Follow them. She can handle it.

1083
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:41,251
Okay.

1084
01:23:06,001 --> 01:23:06,875
Ah!

1085
01:23:12,543 --> 01:23:13,418
Hm?

1086
01:23:15,043 --> 01:23:16,043
Ah!

1087
01:23:23,834 --> 01:23:25,043
Hey, hey, hey!

1088
01:23:37,834 --> 01:23:39,458
Faster. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1089
01:23:41,293 --> 01:23:43,542
They're still
behind us. Faster!

1090
01:23:47,168 --> 01:23:48,583
Your nickname
shouldn't be "Dead Man."

1091
01:23:48,584 --> 01:23:50,000
You look more like a

1092
01:23:50,001 --> 01:23:51,709
frozen Peking duck.

1093
01:23:55,418 --> 01:23:57,334
Professor? Professor?

1094
01:23:58,584 --> 01:23:59,418
Professor?

1095
01:23:59,876 --> 01:24:00,709
Professor?

1096
01:24:01,626 --> 01:24:05,042
They broke the dongle
and I can't shut the refinery down.

1097
01:24:05,043 --> 01:24:06,834
It's all up to you now.

1098
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:08,375
Stay here.

1099
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,043
I will be back right away.

1100
01:24:29,334 --> 01:24:30,376
Come on.

1101
01:24:32,626 --> 01:24:33,626
Go!

1102
01:24:35,543 --> 01:24:36,500
Go.

1103
01:24:36,501 --> 01:24:37,418
No, no, no, no.

1104
01:24:38,168 --> 01:24:39,293
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

1105
01:24:40,626 --> 01:24:41,959
Whoo!

1106
01:24:47,793 --> 01:24:49,750
- No, no, we'll never make it!
- No, we'll make it.

1107
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,375
- You don't have a chance.
- Just trust me.

1108
01:24:51,376 --> 01:24:52,626
No!

1109
01:25:25,126 --> 01:25:26,125
S-sorry, Susie.

1110
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:27,209
Sorry?

1111
01:25:27,876 --> 01:25:28,917
Get away!

1112
01:25:28,918 --> 01:25:30,375
Sorry, what are you...?

1113
01:25:41,043 --> 01:25:42,043
Hey!

1114
01:25:45,668 --> 01:25:46,708
Slow down!

1115
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:48,501
- Dad!
- Can't you see me?

1116
01:25:50,459 --> 01:25:51,667
Slow down!

1117
01:25:51,668 --> 01:25:52,459
Stop!

1118
01:25:56,501 --> 01:25:57,375
I see you have a...

1119
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:59,833
Make a flat tire joke,
swear I'm gonna lose it.

1120
01:26:02,709 --> 01:26:04,209
I just want to say let's go.

1121
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:06,001
Good.

1122
01:26:09,876 --> 01:26:10,876
Seatbelt.

1123
01:26:16,001 --> 01:26:17,792
Hey, hey. Hey, hey-hey.

1124
01:26:30,126 --> 01:26:31,375
We're gonna catch him.

1125
01:26:31,376 --> 01:26:32,333
Shortcut, nine o'clock.

1126
01:26:32,334 --> 01:26:33,500
- What?
- What?

1127
01:26:33,501 --> 01:26:34,333
That's eight.

1128
01:26:34,334 --> 01:26:36,042
That's an eight? What do you mean?
-This is nine.

1129
01:26:36,043 --> 01:26:37,917
That's not a nine! It looks
like a baby pirate hand.

1130
01:26:37,918 --> 01:26:40,417
- Argh!
- Okay-okay, no more hand signal, okay?

1131
01:26:40,418 --> 01:26:41,876
Go that way.

1132
01:26:50,168 --> 01:26:51,375
Gotta go faster.

1133
01:26:51,376 --> 01:26:53,001
That's as fast as I can go.

1134
01:26:57,918 --> 01:26:59,501
Not if we use the jet.

1135
01:27:00,168 --> 01:27:01,334
How?

1136
01:27:02,251 --> 01:27:03,918
If I were you, I'd hold on.

1137
01:27:16,293 --> 01:27:18,834
Aah!

1138
01:27:24,209 --> 01:27:25,459
Stop the trucks!

1139
01:27:25,959 --> 01:27:27,376
Stop the trucks now!

1140
01:27:39,376 --> 01:27:41,625
Hit the back, not the middle.

1141
01:27:41,626 --> 01:27:42,793
Okay!

1142
01:27:44,668 --> 01:27:45,626
Aah!

1143
01:28:14,043 --> 01:28:15,459
No...!

1144
01:28:28,543 --> 01:28:29,959
Morgan, hey!

1145
01:29:01,043 --> 01:29:02,334
Well done, Chris.

1146
01:29:08,834 --> 01:29:09,668
You want to earn

1147
01:29:10,918 --> 01:29:12,293
a bigger cut of the pie?

1148
01:29:14,418 --> 01:29:15,751
You killed my brother.

1149
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:17,709
Ah, yeah.

1150
01:29:31,501 --> 01:29:32,501
Chris!

1151
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:35,876
- I told you wear your seat belt!
- Go!

1152
01:29:37,043 --> 01:29:38,043
Go.

1153
01:29:43,209 --> 01:29:45,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hey!

1154
01:29:45,709 --> 01:29:46,750
You're sinking!

1155
01:29:52,751 --> 01:29:53,917
Get the outriggers out.

1156
01:29:53,918 --> 01:29:55,458
Extend
the outriggers down!

1157
01:29:55,459 --> 01:29:57,000
Which switch?

1158
01:29:57,001 --> 01:29:58,583
- Where's the button?
- By the wheel.

1159
01:29:58,584 --> 01:29:59,793
By the wheel!

1160
01:30:02,334 --> 01:30:03,668
I got this, you drive.

1161
01:30:13,668 --> 01:30:15,167
You gonna run?

1162
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,375
No.

1163
01:30:16,376 --> 01:30:17,668
Get on.

1164
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:23,958
Seatbelt?

1165
01:30:23,959 --> 01:30:24,958
- Yes.
- Ready?

1166
01:30:24,959 --> 01:30:26,000
Hit it!

1167
01:30:26,001 --> 01:30:27,167
Hold tight!

1168
01:30:28,334 --> 01:30:29,375
- Go.
- Go.

1169
01:31:01,251 --> 01:31:02,376
Aah!

1170
01:31:13,668 --> 01:31:15,250
Jump on the count of five.

1171
01:31:15,251 --> 01:31:17,168
I can't hear you!

1172
01:31:18,418 --> 01:31:19,792
Five!

1173
01:31:19,793 --> 01:31:20,959
What?!

1174
01:31:27,668 --> 01:31:30,626
I know you said no
more hand signals!

1175
01:31:31,751 --> 01:31:33,333
This is an exception!

1176
01:31:35,876 --> 01:31:37,168
Four!

1177
01:31:38,334 --> 01:31:39,334
Three!

1178
01:31:43,876 --> 01:31:44,833
Two!

1179
01:31:49,584 --> 01:31:50,792
Jump!

1180
01:31:55,793 --> 01:31:57,418
Aah!

1181
01:32:04,876 --> 01:32:05,917
Ah.

1182
01:32:37,668 --> 01:32:38,668
Huh.

1183
01:32:39,376 --> 01:32:40,626
Don't be scared.

1184
01:32:41,709 --> 01:32:43,543
I'm here. I am with you.

1185
01:33:48,459 --> 01:33:49,579
Where is Chris?

1186
01:33:51,668 --> 01:33:52,668
Chris!

1187
01:33:53,168 --> 01:33:54,168
Chris!

1188
01:33:55,834 --> 01:33:56,834
Chris!

1189
01:34:02,543 --> 01:34:03,543
Chris.

1190
01:34:52,543 --> 01:34:54,459
How did
you get my diary?

1191
01:35:10,876 --> 01:35:13,168
You two
have always been with me.

1192
01:35:21,251 --> 01:35:22,251
Dad?

1193
01:35:33,418 --> 01:35:34,501
I understand now.

1194
01:35:54,959 --> 01:35:55,792
Chris!

1195
01:35:55,793 --> 01:35:57,913
It's a beautiful moment but
I really could use a hand.

1196
01:35:59,543 --> 01:36:00,750
Chris!

1197
01:36:02,959 --> 01:36:04,208
I thought you'd never make it.

1198
01:36:04,209 --> 01:36:05,625
- Oh.
- Are you okay?

1199
01:36:05,626 --> 01:36:06,458
You too.

1200
01:36:06,459 --> 01:36:08,708
Oh, I'm scared-scared
of heights. I mean

1201
01:36:08,709 --> 01:36:11,292
I'm alive, I'm alive!

1202
01:36:11,293 --> 01:36:12,917
Oh, and I'm totally single

1203
01:36:12,918 --> 01:36:15,167
and now is a good time for me to
say that I'm disease-free, too.

1204
01:36:15,168 --> 01:36:17,125
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, I had a scare with hepatitis,

1205
01:36:17,126 --> 01:36:18,966
but it turned out to be
nothing. It was a cold.

1206
01:36:21,209 --> 01:36:22,209
Hey.

1207
01:36:23,876 --> 01:36:25,375
Don't even think
about it, <i>bangchui</i>.

1208
01:36:25,376 --> 01:36:27,126
But I
thought we're family.

1209
01:36:28,126 --> 01:36:29,376
We are not family.

1210
01:36:30,001 --> 01:36:32,626
How do you think you even stand
a chance with my daughter?

1211
01:36:33,709 --> 01:36:34,918
What? What does that mean?

1212
01:36:36,043 --> 01:36:37,209
You have a lot to learn.

1213
01:36:43,334 --> 01:36:44,334
Okay, Confucius,

1214
01:36:46,209 --> 01:36:48,329
you know everything, right?
How do we get out of here?

1215
01:36:53,209 --> 01:36:54,209
I have idea.

1216
01:36:56,043 --> 01:36:57,750
Help!!

1217
01:36:59,334 --> 01:37:01,543
Help!!

1218
01:37:02,293 --> 01:37:03,333
Really?

1219
01:37:03,334 --> 01:37:04,418
This is your great idea?

1220
01:37:04,834 --> 01:37:05,834
You have any idea?

1221
01:37:17,251 --> 01:37:19,125
- Don't move.
- Get on the ground!

1222
01:37:19,126 --> 01:37:21,206
Put
your hands behind your back!

1223
01:37:23,543 --> 01:37:25,459
The bridge
is now under control.

1224
01:37:30,459 --> 01:37:32,626
Pull!

1225
01:37:34,793 --> 01:37:36,834
Pull, pull!

1226
01:37:37,876 --> 01:37:39,126
Pull!

1227
01:38:10,543 --> 01:38:12,376
You
stay away from him!

1228
01:38:13,251 --> 01:38:14,876
- Dragon Luo!
- Huh?

1229
01:38:15,834 --> 01:38:18,418
We have just been notified,
there's a new mission.

1230
01:38:20,376 --> 01:38:21,959
You wanna join us?

1231
01:38:29,168 --> 01:38:32,293
- Action!
- Magazine, magazine! Catch!

1232
01:38:41,168 --> 01:38:42,376
Awesome. Cut.

1233
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:45,083
You go. I got this.

1234
01:38:45,084 --> 01:38:46,125
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1235
01:38:46,126 --> 01:38:47,209
Wrong hand.

1236
01:38:47,501 --> 01:38:48,750
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1237
01:38:48,751 --> 01:38:50,001
- This one?
- Yes.

1238
01:38:50,376 --> 01:38:51,376
Oh.

1239
01:38:52,334 --> 01:38:53,774
One more.

1240
01:38:53,918 --> 01:38:55,625
I'm wiping the
company out, Chris.

1241
01:38:55,626 --> 01:38:56,917
Yeah, no shit, Captain Obvious.

1242
01:38:56,918 --> 01:38:59,958
You got a bunch of Arabs in Ninja
masks bleeding this place dry.

1243
01:38:59,959 --> 01:39:01,875
And while you're wiping the company
out, you know what I'm doing?

1244
01:39:01,876 --> 01:39:03,917
- No.
- You told me to date a little more, so uh,

1245
01:39:03,918 --> 01:39:05,875
see Father Time over
there with the AK 47?

1246
01:39:05,876 --> 01:39:07,583
- Yeah.
- We've been talking online.

1247
01:39:07,584 --> 01:39:10,542
I met him through an app called
Finder. I thought it was "find her"

1248
01:39:10,543 --> 01:39:12,208
but it's really a "finder" app.

1249
01:39:12,209 --> 01:39:13,542
We share a lot of commonalities.

1250
01:39:13,543 --> 01:39:16,042
We both live in small villages,
proficient with firearms.

1251
01:39:16,043 --> 01:39:17,208
Both watched Lawrence of Arabia.

1252
01:39:17,209 --> 01:39:18,293
Come on!

1253
01:39:23,668 --> 01:39:24,542
Hey, hey.

1254
01:39:24,543 --> 01:39:25,626
Come on!

1255
01:39:30,168 --> 01:39:31,543
- Hey.
- Come on!

1256
01:39:32,918 --> 01:39:34,278
Go!

1257
01:39:35,626 --> 01:39:36,626
My man.

1258
01:39:38,168 --> 01:39:39,501
Look at her, man.

1259
01:39:40,209 --> 01:39:41,209
She is hot.

1260
01:39:42,126 --> 01:39:43,126
That booty.

1261
01:39:43,668 --> 01:39:45,834
I'm the type of guy to
bend that over and...

1262
01:39:47,376 --> 01:39:49,293
smack that ass. I mean,

1263
01:39:50,168 --> 01:39:51,542
Whoo... I'm a freak.

1264
01:39:51,543 --> 01:39:52,834
I will eat some ass.

1265
01:39:53,459 --> 01:39:56,083
I will stay down there. You
know what they call that?

1266
01:39:56,084 --> 01:39:59,583
They call that a capsized motorboat
because it's a motorboat upside down.

1267
01:39:59,584 --> 01:40:01,334
I mean...

1268
01:40:04,751 --> 01:40:05,958
- Dragon Luo?
- Yes.

1269
01:40:05,959 --> 01:40:07,917
I'm the lead
engineer here, Cheng Ying.

1270
01:40:07,918 --> 01:40:09,208
Thank you for
coming to rescue us.

1271
01:40:09,209 --> 01:40:10,333
Herro, plofessor.

1272
01:40:10,334 --> 01:40:13,208
You...

1273
01:40:15,251 --> 01:40:16,458
Hello, how are you?

1274
01:40:16,459 --> 01:40:17,750
I am fine.

1275
01:40:23,918 --> 01:40:25,709
You keep a gun under the seat?

1276
01:40:26,084 --> 01:40:29,001
I also keep one in my pants but
it could be like a Walther PPK.

1277
01:40:29,418 --> 01:40:30,876
It's a small gun.

1278
01:40:32,668 --> 01:40:33,875
- Dragon Luo?
- Yes.

1279
01:40:33,876 --> 01:40:35,625
I'm the lead
engineer here, Cheng Ying.

1280
01:40:35,626 --> 01:40:36,917
Thank you for
coming to rescue us.

1281
01:40:36,918 --> 01:40:37,958
Hello, professor.

1282
01:40:37,959 --> 01:40:39,719
You...

1283
01:40:43,126 --> 01:40:44,793
Thank you. Six o'clock.

1284
01:40:47,043 --> 01:40:48,043
Nine o'clock.

1285
01:40:48,543 --> 01:40:49,543
Ten o'clock?

1286
01:40:51,626 --> 01:40:52,793
Shit, oh shit.

1287
01:40:53,709 --> 01:40:56,208
Ah! You told me you
would be better.

1288
01:40:56,209 --> 01:40:58,083
My
name is Dragon Luo.

1289
01:40:58,084 --> 01:40:59,333
I
forgot your name.

1290
01:40:59,334 --> 01:41:01,959
You can call me
big brother or Jackie Chan.

1291
01:41:10,168 --> 01:41:11,000
Cut!

1292
01:41:11,001 --> 01:41:12,168
That's a nine.

1293
01:41:12,959 --> 01:41:14,125
Uh, eight, now...

1294
01:41:14,126 --> 01:41:16,375
Just avoid the nine.
No more hand signal.

1295
01:41:16,376 --> 01:41:18,208
Oh! Go over there.

1296
01:41:18,209 --> 01:41:21,458
One more. You, your two
hands all block my, my face.

1297
01:41:21,459 --> 01:41:22,751
One more.

1298
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:25,708
How was that nine? That looks
like a baby pirate hand.

1299
01:41:25,709 --> 01:41:28,625
Okay, here real quick: what's
a pirate's favorite letter?

1300
01:41:28,626 --> 01:41:29,542
What?

1301
01:41:29,543 --> 01:41:32,458
R? No, you would
think it's the R,

1302
01:41:32,459 --> 01:41:33,918
but it's the "C."

1303
01:41:37,209 --> 01:41:38,293
He steal my shot.

1304
01:41:39,043 --> 01:41:40,667
He just keeps saying dialogue.

1305
01:41:45,209 --> 01:41:46,959
I don't even know
what you saying.
