No, those days
for you are long gone,

539
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:40,972
but you're still a driver.

you made my little run.

See, you passed
the test, John,

543

and now I need your skills.

544
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:54,110
There's gonna be
a tournament,

00:28:54,152 --> 00:28:56,195
the first of its kind

from all across the country,

from all walks of life,
are gonna be invited to compete.

548
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:07,415
See, the tournament
only has one rule:

549
00:29:07,457 --> 00:29:09,959
Survive.

550
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:14,213
And you better believe who
you face won't play fair.

551
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:17,050
This is where
you come in, John.

552
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:21,095
You are my horse,
and I need you to win,

553

because Calypso is offering
quite a prize.

554

their greatest wish
come true.

You're gonna
help me win, John,

557
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:35,068
and you're gonna do it
by getting behind the wheel

558
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:36,903
and turning every
car and contestant

559

of twisted metal.

You will drive, John Doe,

562
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,746
and you will win.
