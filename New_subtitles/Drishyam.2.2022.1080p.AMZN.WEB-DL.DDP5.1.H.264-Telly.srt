1
00:02:52,816 --> 00:02:55,691
Pay attention to the sights,
and not the words.

2
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,608
Because sounds can
often be deceptive.

3
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:01,691
But sight...

4
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:03,941
Sights never lie.

5
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:08,691
So the question is not
what is in front of your eyes.

6
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:13,112
The question is what
are you looking at?

7
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:19,024
David, my brother.

8
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:21,363
How are you?

9
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:22,691
All good, man.

10
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:23,941
Hand it over.

11
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,733
Next time you got to be here earlier.

12
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:31,858
You can't keep me waiting like this.

13
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:38,774
You see,
Tony, I want to leave this job.

14
00:04:39,608 --> 00:04:42,738
If I don't leave this job,
my wife will leave me.

15
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:44,113
That's a good thing.

16
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:45,483
End of all your troubles.

17
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:47,404
Let her go. Find yourself a new wife.

18
00:04:47,524 --> 00:04:50,483
You see, you can't
keep changing jobs all the time.

19
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:54,941
I apologise, but I really
cannot continue doing this.

20
00:04:58,483 --> 00:04:59,608
Tony.

21
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:01,649
Tony.

22
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:04,483
Give me my money, Tony.

23
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:07,149
I need the money.

24
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:12,238
You'll get paid
only after you make the next delivery.

25
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:13,571
Understood.

26
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:15,649
- Tony, please listen to me...
- Move!

27
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,238
Tony, I need the money.

28
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:21,858
My family... please give
me my money, Tony.

29
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:24,649
David!

30
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:27,566
David, stop.

31
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:31,233
Stop.

32
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:00,983
You brought the police!

33
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:02,816
You scum.

34
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:05,691
I didn't bring anyone!

35
00:06:32,774 --> 00:06:35,345
Stop. Stop. Stop.

36
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,521
Catch him. Stop.

37
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:12,108
Mary, open the door.

38
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,774
Coming. Hold on.

39
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:15,738
Mary, open the door.

40
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:17,821
- What...
- What took you so long?

41
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:18,524
What happened?

42
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,354
Pack your bags.
We need to leave right now!

43
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:21,474
Go where?

44
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,399
What did you do?

45
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:26,108
Where is Agnelo?

46
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:26,901
Inside.

47
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:27,696
Go get him.

48
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:29,523
- Agnelo...
- Who beat you up?

49
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:30,946
- Careful.
- Hey, Agnelo.

50
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,437
- Agnelo...
- What did you do?

51
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:33,774
Agnelo.

52
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,316
Pick him up.

53
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:37,245
Why are you screaming?

54
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,613
What are you doing?

55
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,316
David, who did this?

56
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:42,988
Tell me what did you do?

57
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:45,029
This is no time to explain, Mary.

58
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,738
Just do as I said.
Stop driving me crazy!

59
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:51,996
Surrender now,
you don't have a choice.

60
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:54,088
Surrender now.

61
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,649
"The truth seems like
a lie courtesy of your eyes."

62
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:36,024
"Drishyam (Visual)!"

63
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:44,238
"Is it true what they see
or is it an illusion."

64
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:45,858
"Drishyam!"

65
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:54,279
"All trials and the pleas."

66
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,696
"Keep testifying for the truth."

67
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:00,149
"Drishyam!"

68
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:02,316
"Drishyam!"

69
00:10:04,024 --> 00:10:07,066
"Focus on the sights,
not on the sounds."

70
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,858
"Because sounds can
often be deceptive."

71
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:14,941
"But sights... never lie."

72
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:19,149
"So question you need to ask
is not what you see."

73
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:22,941
"The question is
what are you trying to see."

74
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:46,191
"Lies are filled with several secrets
swearing to be all true."

75
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,649
"Drishyam!"

76
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:49,941
"Drishyam!"

77
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:55,816
"Although a mystery but the truth
can't stay hidden for long,"

78
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:57,441
"Drishyam!"

79
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,858
"Drishyam!"

80
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:05,738
"All trials and the pleas."

81
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:10,154
"Keep testifying for the truth."

82
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:11,816
"Drishyam!"

83
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:14,024
"Drishyam!"

84
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:05,483
Did you forget what I said
or have you forgotten?

85
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:08,108
See...

86
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:14,654
I told you one day,
I'll drag you to jail.

87
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:18,524
Even if I've to plot
fake evidence for it.

88
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:21,233
Truth is like a seed, inspector.

89
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:23,733
Doesn't matter how deep you bury it,

90
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,899
it always comes out someday.

91
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:27,816
Take him away.

92
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:28,946
Come on.

93
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,946
I'll teach you a lesson
in the police station.

94
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,066
Come on.

95
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:36,691
Sir, how did you like the film?

96
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:38,988
The film has incredible reviews.

97
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:41,233
And advance booking is in full swing.

98
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:43,821
It will only last
the first couple of days.

99
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:45,154
After that, it's a no-show.

100
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:46,613
The hero goes to jail in the end.

101
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,084
People don't like endings like these.

102
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:49,149
What do we do, sir?

103
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:53,654
Increase shows of the comedy film
that was playing earlier.

104
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:54,858
Okay, sir.

105
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:08,774
Vijay.

106
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,233
Hurry up, Vijay.

107
00:13:10,274 --> 00:13:12,114
This is the second time
I'm reheating the food.

108
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:13,899
Bring the salad.

109
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:16,858
Sorry.

110
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:20,024
New releases always make me late.

111
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:23,899
Phone down.

112
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:27,946
Papa, when will the shooting
of our film begin?

113
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:29,066
Soon.

114
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,233
And who will you cast as the hero?

115
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:32,899
Ranbir Kapoor.

116
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,071
Please, dad. Please. Please.

117
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:36,316
Ranbir Kapoor?

118
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,149
Okay. I'll talk to him.

119
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:41,941
Indeed. Because Ranbir Kapoor
is related to us, isn't he?

120
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:43,149
Why?

121
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:45,738
Is Ranbir Kapoor related
to all the other producers?

122
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,191
He does their films too.

123
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,738
And we have a pretty solid story.

124
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:50,738
It will be a big hit.

125
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:52,108
And what if it's not.

126
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:55,358
You are always so negative.

127
00:13:55,816 --> 00:13:57,649
One should always be positive.

128
00:13:58,441 --> 00:13:59,858
You're always demoralising.

129
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:02,816
Now don't ask me
the meaning of 'demoralise'.

130
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:05,149
I do know that much English.

131
00:14:05,941 --> 00:14:08,899
Demoralise meaning Note bandi
(demonetisation), correct?

132
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:12,191
Correct.

133
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:15,858
Hey, why are you two laughing?

134
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:17,358
She is right.

135
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:29,149
Why don't you listen to me?

136
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:31,524
Don't make me repeat myself!

137
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,738
Listen to me. I don't have any money.

138
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:35,000
- You don't have money.
- No, I don't.

139
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:36,904
- I don't have money.
- How dare you lie to me?

140
00:14:37,024 --> 00:14:39,264
I don't have any money.
I won't give you money for booze!

141
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:41,024
How dare you not give me money?

142
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:43,250
You should keep the money under
my pillow without having to tell you.

143
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:45,154
- Do you understand?
- Leave me.

144
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:46,709
- Take it out.
- I don't have any money.

145
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:49,238
What are you doing? I don't...

146
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:51,149
There they go again in the morning.

147
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,134
A cup of tea, please.

148
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:56,217
- I won't give you money.
- You won't?

149
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:57,774
Poor thing.

150
00:14:58,524 --> 00:14:59,858
Do something.

151
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,414
I don't want to see that idiot's face
in the morning.

152
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:03,321
Get a job.

153
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:04,881
If I get a job, when will I booze...

154
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:06,571
When Anju used to have seizures,

155
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:08,738
Jenny was the only one who helped me.

156
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:10,329
You weren't even around.

157
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:12,818
Give me the money.

158
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:14,024
Do something!

159
00:15:14,274 --> 00:15:16,149
Don't do this, please.

160
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:19,738
I won't give you money
even if you kill me.

161
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:21,321
- I see...
- Leave me. Don't do this.

162
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:23,441
I will kill you today!

163
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:25,524
I'll show you.

164
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,649
- What are you doing?
- It's do or die today.

165
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:29,649
Give me money! Give me money!

166
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,654
Beating your own wife.
Aren't you ashamed?

167
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:33,649
He'll drink to his grave someday.

168
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,524
He's been drinking all morning.

169
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:38,321
When I refused to give him more money,
he hit me.

170
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:40,125
Go make a buck on your own.
I won't give you money...

171
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,524
Make a buck on my own? How?

172
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,654
And you, Vijay Salgaonkar.

173
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:46,779
Who called you here? Who called you?

174
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:49,613
Stop meddling in my affairs.

175
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:50,774
Stay away.

176
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:53,238
This isn't your property anymore,

177
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:55,441
to come and go as you please.

178
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:58,190
I paid you a fair price
for this piece of land.

179
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,858
I respect the law too much,

180
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:01,708
otherwise,
I would have set you straight.

181
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:04,066
You and your respect for the law.

182
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:06,066
I know everything.

183
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:08,863
- In fact, all of Goa knows.
- Quiet.

184
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:13,196
How you confused the law
with your 2nd and 3rd October story,

185
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:14,946
I know everything.

186
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:18,279
And next time,
if you interfere in my private matter,

187
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,859
- then I will...
- What?

188
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:20,988
You will what?

189
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:23,858
Take it. Get lost! Go on!

190
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:26,774
My money.

191
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:30,483
Thank you, darling.

192
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:31,858
Get lost.

193
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:34,649
I'll show you. I know everything.

194
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:41,608
Sorry, brother.

195
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:43,613
You should try
filing a police complaint.

196
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,274
They fix even the worst.

197
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:48,649
The police can't
make him quit drinking.

198
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,238
He might not quit drinking,

199
00:16:50,358 --> 00:16:51,983
but at least he'll stop hitting you.

200
00:16:53,524 --> 00:16:55,816
- The rest is up to you.
- But...

201
00:16:57,524 --> 00:16:58,691
Jenny.

202
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:01,274
He is right.

203
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:09,321
Another serious controversy
on Payal Shikhawat's show.

204
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:13,029
According to sources, Om Kapoor
was supposed to be one of the guest.

205
00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:15,113
But due health issues...

206
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,733
The entire film industry is corrupt.

207
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:21,649
You make it sound like
you know someone in the film industry.

208
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:26,613
Martin, what's my last month's bill?

209
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:30,029
Another one from the industry.

210
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,358
Rs. 12,400.

211
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:34,816
Careful, Martin.

212
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:37,524
A lot of ridiculous news
has been surfacing recently

213
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:38,696
about the film industry.

214
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:41,857
That's where all
these cons are headed.

215
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,608
Martin, check the kitchen.

216
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:46,290
Smells like something burning.

217
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:51,956
Dude, he humiliated you,
and you did nothing.

218
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:53,608
He's a criminal.

219
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:55,608
What can you expect from him?

220
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:57,358
And we are decent people.

221
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,233
We shouldn't be talking
to these murderers.

222
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:05,691
Jose.

223
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:06,987
Jose...

224
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:11,206
"The water is blue.
And day is also sunny..."

225
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:17,399
Jose.

226
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:19,191
- Jose!
- Yes.

227
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,691
- Pick up the phone.
- Yes...

228
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:24,649
Hello. Mirage Cable.

229
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:28,738
Yes... no... not at all.
I mean yes...

230
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,858
I'll send someone over.
Sorry, sorry. I'll send someone.

231
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:34,858
Got yelled at again.

232
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:36,733
When will you ever learn?

233
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,191
Sometimes I wonder
why I made you the manager.

234
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:41,818
Sir... I am so hardworking.

235
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:44,688
See, I've gathered
the entire month's collection.

236
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:48,191
You were supposed to deposit
this money in the bank.

237
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:50,279
Sorry, I forgot.

238
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:51,696
And the CCTV camera.

239
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:53,250
I told you dozens of times
to get it fixed.

240
00:18:53,274 --> 00:18:54,292
I am sure you forgot that too.

241
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:58,441
It's hard to forget if you call
a dozen times to get the CCTV fixed.

242
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:00,649
Mister.

243
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:02,733
Come here.

244
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:05,113
How much longer will it take?

245
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:06,071
It's done.

246
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:06,904
What was wrong?

247
00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:09,071
It was a software issue, sir.
It's been updated now.

248
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:09,988
Everything is working fine.

249
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,108
Look...

250
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:14,404
Sir, that's your cable TV office,

251
00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:15,733
and the office premises.

252
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:19,029
That's the cabin at the theatre,

253
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:20,358
and the premise.

254
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:22,363
All good now?

255
00:19:22,483 --> 00:19:23,733
What's good about it?

256
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,154
No privacy at all.

257
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:27,946
You'll know what we are up to.

258
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,483
I always know who's working
and who's not.

259
00:19:42,358 --> 00:19:44,191
Another one here.

260
00:19:45,941 --> 00:19:46,941
Vijay sir.

261
00:19:47,024 --> 00:19:49,149
Some Mahesh Deshmukh's
here to see you.

262
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:20,316
How are you, Vijay?

263
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,236
I'm fine.

264
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,024
Is this your theatre?

265
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:27,441
Yes.

266
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:28,906
It's very nice.

267
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:33,691
We've been here for two weeks.

268
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:38,524
We're flying back to London
in a couple of days.

269
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:40,441
We were here last year too.

270
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:44,974
For Sam's rituals.

271
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:50,149
Although the rituals
are conducted with the remains, but...

272
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:55,524
Since we didn't have
Sam's remains, so...

273
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:01,983
The priest said Sam's spirit
hasn't received salvation yet.

274
00:21:02,483 --> 00:21:03,858
For that...

275
00:21:05,274 --> 00:21:07,608
we must perform the rituals
with his remains.

276
00:21:10,483 --> 00:21:13,691
Vijay, can you please tell me
where Sam's body is?

277
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:15,899
Please.

278
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:21,571
You can trust me.
I won't tell anyone.

279
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:23,399
Not even, Me era. Please.

280
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,858
Please. Don't do this.

281
00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:31,524
It's not that I don't trust you.

282
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:35,816
But I can't help
you even if I want to.

283
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:40,399
I've a request.

284
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:44,399
Don't come back here.

285
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:02,774
Vijay.

286
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:05,108
All well?

287
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:08,196
Yes.

288
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:10,108
How about you? How's Dubai?

289
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:11,929
Dubai is nice.

290
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:13,608
It's beautiful.

291
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:16,983
But not as beautiful as Goa.

292
00:22:19,316 --> 00:22:21,941
So, what's the progress on our film?

293
00:22:25,316 --> 00:22:27,066
Murad sir,

294
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:30,816
I narrated the story of my film
to several people.

295
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:32,858
They all thought
it was pretty impressive.

296
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:34,649
But...

297
00:22:35,816 --> 00:22:38,441
they still don't
like the film's ending.

298
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:44,483
All my experiences in life
has come through films.

299
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:49,774
And now I've invested
all my life's savings in this film.

300
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:52,066
If you don't mind,

301
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:54,649
I would like to share
an idea with you.

302
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,483
Why would I mind?

303
00:22:57,316 --> 00:23:00,696
I know you are not
one of those producers,

304
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:02,608
who run after money.

305
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:06,816
In fact, frankly speaking
your ideas are pretty realistic.

306
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:09,483
Connected to human emotions.

307
00:23:10,108 --> 00:23:11,816
So... what's the idea.

308
00:23:13,913 --> 00:23:14,913
Vijay.

309
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,330
Yes.

310
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:20,622
I know you are crazy about films.

311
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:26,497
So when you sold a piece of your land,
and started a theatre, I said nothing.

312
00:23:27,913 --> 00:23:31,997
But... do you have
to produce this film?

313
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:33,372
What is the problem?

314
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,080
Everything is going pretty smooth.

315
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,288
I know that. But...

316
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:40,830
We have two daughters.

317
00:23:41,163 --> 00:23:43,872
And we've certain responsibilities
towards them.

318
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:47,122
I am doing it for them.

319
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:52,788
By the way, how much money have you,
invested in the film till date.

320
00:23:56,997 --> 00:23:58,372
Tell me.

321
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:01,413
Let me think.

322
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:08,163
Travelling expenses,
hotel bills, writer's fee.

323
00:24:08,955 --> 00:24:10,288
3... 3.5...

324
00:24:11,913 --> 00:24:13,163
3.5 million?

325
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:15,585
You keep telling me to spend wisely,

326
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,205
while you blew away
3.5 million on this film.

327
00:24:18,872 --> 00:24:20,163
I didn't blow it away.

328
00:24:21,413 --> 00:24:22,622
It's an investment.

329
00:24:23,747 --> 00:24:25,205
And what are you doing now?

330
00:24:26,705 --> 00:24:27,788
Romancing.

331
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:41,538
"I want us to be together
when the sun's in the sky,"

332
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:46,580
"be together
when the moon's shining bright."

333
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:54,997
"Together in happiness,
and in sorrows."

334
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:02,502
"Even if our own shadow leave us,"

335
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:07,330
"deserts us for good,
but we'll be together."

336
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,752
"We lack nothing,
with the earth under our heads,"

337
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:17,835
"and the sky above us,
and be together always."

338
00:25:17,955 --> 00:25:22,997
"I want us to be together
when the sun's in the sky,"

339
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:28,080
"be together
when the moon's shining bright."

340
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:36,330
"Together in happiness,
and in sorrows."

341
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:07,002
"Just like life is filled with joy,"

342
00:26:07,122 --> 00:26:12,085
"may this last forever."

343
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:17,252
"May our happiness never be jinxed,"

344
00:26:17,372 --> 00:26:22,377
"let it stay this way."

345
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:27,668
"I want us to be together
on a rainy day,"

346
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:32,835
"together when the spring is upon us."

347
00:26:32,955 --> 00:26:37,960
"I want us to be together
when the sun's in the sky,"

348
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,455
"be together
when the moon's shining bright."

349
00:27:09,872 --> 00:27:11,872
I was just passing-by
and thought I should drop in.

350
00:27:13,372 --> 00:27:14,413
How is your health now?

351
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:16,788
My health is perfect.

352
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:20,163
What did the doctor say?

353
00:27:20,663 --> 00:27:23,627
The doctor said
you've many more years to live, Savio.

354
00:27:23,747 --> 00:27:25,497
At least a year.

355
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:30,085
Even a couple of months
is enough if you live properly.

356
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:32,538
Otherwise,
even a decade isn't sufficient.

357
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:37,580
Sorry. I couldn't attend
your daughter's wedding.

358
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:44,288
Vijay.

359
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,038
There is no need for this.

360
00:27:47,955 --> 00:27:50,330
You've already done so much for me.

361
00:27:50,538 --> 00:27:52,913
Paid for me daughter's education,

362
00:27:53,413 --> 00:27:54,747
her wedding.

363
00:27:55,413 --> 00:27:57,205
Do you want to adopt me now?

364
00:27:58,247 --> 00:27:59,460
This isn't for you,

365
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,955
it's for your daughter.

366
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:03,793
Don't hesitate to ask
if you need anything else.

367
00:28:03,913 --> 00:28:06,289
May God bless your family, brother.

368
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:57,455
Agnelo?

369
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:05,622
Take it.

370
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,163
What school do you go to?

371
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,085
I don't go to any school.

372
00:29:14,205 --> 00:29:16,997
- Mom tutors me at home.
- Enough, Angelo.

373
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:18,872
Go outside.

374
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,497
Doesn't Agnelo go to school?

375
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,830
You are asking this?

376
00:29:37,663 --> 00:29:39,080
You went to jail.

377
00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:42,747
I had to sell off our house
to repay your debts.

378
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:45,622
Can't you see the condition
we're living in?

379
00:29:45,913 --> 00:29:50,288
I don't have money for basic expenses!
You think I'll send him to school!

380
00:29:56,122 --> 00:29:58,122
Where do you think you're going?

381
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,330
I ruined everything, Mary.

382
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:08,538
Now I will fix it.

383
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:16,538
If with your thoughts,
words or actions,

384
00:30:16,788 --> 00:30:20,705
you hurt someone willingly
or unwillingly.

385
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,247
Then 'Michhami Dukadum' is supposed
to be the period to seek forgiveness.

386
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:31,122
Redemption for human beings
lies in forgiveness and atonement.

387
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:34,668
"Happy birthday to you."

388
00:30:34,788 --> 00:30:37,543
"Happy birthday to you."

389
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,747
[Indistinct chatter on TV]

390
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,793
"Happy birthday to you."

391
00:30:44,913 --> 00:30:48,122
Me era, everyone's waiting for you.

392
00:30:50,622 --> 00:30:52,622
See that's Sam's fourth birthday.

393
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,997
He was so terrified,
he wouldn't let go of my arm.

394
00:30:59,212 --> 00:31:00,726
Happy birthday boy.

395
00:31:00,846 --> 00:31:02,233
Happy birthday.

396
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:07,673
Come on.
Come on. Everybody, come on.

397
00:31:11,877 --> 00:31:13,727
I went to see Vijay, Me era.

398
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:16,654
Why?

399
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,644
To ask for Sam's remains.

400
00:31:20,131 --> 00:31:23,131
And... did he tell you everything?

401
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:26,324
What were you even thinking, Mahesh?

402
00:31:26,822 --> 00:31:28,905
Obviously, I wasn't thinking.

403
00:31:30,447 --> 00:31:32,447
Me era, we've lost our son.

404
00:31:34,572 --> 00:31:36,363
I don't want to lose you.

405
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:40,905
I mean just... look at yourself.

406
00:31:41,155 --> 00:31:43,113
You don't eat, you don't sleep.

407
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:46,077
Consulting astrologers.

408
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:49,155
Coming here every year, for the last
seven years and arranging all this.

409
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:51,488
Is this normal?

410
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:56,863
Our son was murdered.

411
00:31:57,572 --> 00:31:59,910
Nothing since then
has been normal for me.

412
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,447
Me era, it's been seven years.

413
00:32:09,905 --> 00:32:12,113
I am his mother, Mahesh!

414
00:32:12,947 --> 00:32:18,530
Be it seven or seven hundred,
I am not going to forget anything.

415
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,405
When you forgive someone,

416
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:29,405
you realise
that you've set a prisoner free.

417
00:32:31,613 --> 00:32:35,665
That prisoner is none other
but yourself.

418
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:40,910
I would like to request
Sameer's mother to come here,

419
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,488
and say a few words.

420
00:32:52,113 --> 00:32:55,655
You said a beautiful thing, Sir.

421
00:32:58,155 --> 00:33:00,280
Human being's redemption
lies in forgiveness.

422
00:33:04,738 --> 00:33:06,863
But there are a few people,

423
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:11,405
whom I cannot forgive
even if I want to.

424
00:33:12,183 --> 00:33:15,822
But today on this occasion, I
would like to say a few words to them.

425
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:20,072
Willingly or unwillingly,
in the near future,

426
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,197
if they have to endure

427
00:33:23,905 --> 00:33:29,613
any kind of pain,
suffering or misery because of me.

428
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:32,072
I would want them,

429
00:33:35,905 --> 00:33:37,238
to forgive me.

430
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:42,318
Michami Dukkadam.

431
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:43,738
Michami Dukkadam.

432
00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:50,578
Bro. Can I ask a question?

433
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,118
Will our film get made?

434
00:33:55,258 --> 00:33:56,591
Do you doubt me?

435
00:33:56,925 --> 00:33:58,258
Not you, bro,

436
00:33:59,008 --> 00:34:00,966
I doubt my luck.

437
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,841
It's been more than a year,
I haven't acted in any drama.

438
00:34:05,258 --> 00:34:07,550
I had an important role
in the last play.

439
00:34:07,883 --> 00:34:10,888
I stood in the background, and
played the banjo throughout the show.

440
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,966
But no one noticed me.

441
00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:16,805
Every good thing
needs time to formulate.

442
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:18,091
We'll make the film,

443
00:34:18,211 --> 00:34:19,716
and you'll be in it for sure.

444
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:21,263
But it's been so long, bro.

445
00:34:21,383 --> 00:34:24,346
Aren't you scared
that someone might steal your idea,

446
00:34:24,466 --> 00:34:26,005
and make something before you?

447
00:34:28,883 --> 00:34:31,883
I've already published
a book of the story.

448
00:34:32,676 --> 00:34:33,676
For copyright purpose.

449
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,050
What have you done, bro?

450
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:36,691
Now everyone will know
what the story is.

451
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,345
Who's going to watch our film?

452
00:34:38,465 --> 00:34:40,346
There is a different set
of audience for films,

453
00:34:40,466 --> 00:34:41,841
and separate for books.

454
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,648
And anyway, I only had
a few dozen copies published.

455
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,925
Must be lying in some random bookshop.

456
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:51,175
The point is...
no one can steal our story.

457
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:55,133
Where is it?
Where are your feet, Lord? Okay.

458
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:56,512
Hello.

459
00:34:56,632 --> 00:34:57,471
Hello.

460
00:34:57,591 --> 00:35:00,175
Vijay, any plans
of coming home tonight?

461
00:35:00,925 --> 00:35:03,925
Nandini, I am very busy.

462
00:35:04,508 --> 00:35:07,513
I know very well
what you're busy doing.

463
00:35:07,633 --> 00:35:10,631
You could have come
home early tonight.

464
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:13,008
We three girls are home alone tonight.

465
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:14,383
Here's an idea.

466
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,175
Call Jenny over.

467
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:19,133
Then all four girls can be home alone.

468
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,550
She hung up.

469
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:28,175
Your wife is in a bad mood tonight.

470
00:35:28,621 --> 00:35:31,425
Your entry is definitely prohibited
today at home.

471
00:35:32,617 --> 00:35:34,675
Take my advice and stay here tonight.

472
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,186
We can continue
partying at the office.

473
00:35:37,883 --> 00:35:39,050
Okay.

474
00:35:42,378 --> 00:35:44,466
Comes apologising in the morning.

475
00:35:45,008 --> 00:35:48,091
Then gets drunk at sundown
and same old story all over again.

476
00:35:48,306 --> 00:35:50,216
You should take Vijay's advice.

477
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:52,487
Try filling a complaint
with the police,

478
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:54,524
they will handle him.

479
00:35:58,691 --> 00:36:03,862
Jenny... you were getting
a marriage proposal for Anju.

480
00:36:03,982 --> 00:36:05,316
What's the progress on that?

481
00:36:05,816 --> 00:36:07,691
They said no, sister.

482
00:36:10,732 --> 00:36:11,941
They said no.

483
00:36:13,024 --> 00:36:14,524
But why?

484
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:17,774
Often it's like, we are unaware of,

485
00:36:18,482 --> 00:36:22,607
what people say about us
behind our backs.

486
00:36:22,941 --> 00:36:26,316
And you are the only other person
I interact with,

487
00:36:26,649 --> 00:36:28,441
so I had no clue.

488
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:32,149
What?

489
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:38,274
Rumours are, sister,

490
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:41,857
that Anju and that boy had an affair.

491
00:36:42,482 --> 00:36:46,524
And Vijay saw those two

492
00:36:46,982 --> 00:36:50,566
in a compromising situation.

493
00:36:51,107 --> 00:36:53,399
And that's why Vijay...

494
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:57,607
Killed the boy.

495
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:02,279
People even say
that he was a decent boy.

496
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:05,237
- Anju set him up...
- People say rubbish.

497
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,625
They say anything they feel like.

498
00:37:06,649 --> 00:37:08,487
Whatever happened wasn't Anju's fault.

499
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:11,987
That boy was a spoilt brat.

500
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:13,774
That's why Anju...

501
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:21,446
It's okay, don't worry.

502
00:37:21,566 --> 00:37:24,029
People say things.

503
00:37:24,149 --> 00:37:28,696
Just wait and watch,
we'll find other suitors for Anju.

504
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:30,399
Someone better.

505
00:37:52,316 --> 00:37:54,446
I got a call from Anju's school,

506
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:56,774
saying her exams
will begin earlier this time.

507
00:37:57,524 --> 00:37:59,480
Papa...

508
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:03,357
- What happened?
- The police are coming.

509
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:09,149
There's no need to be afraid.

510
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:10,691
Sit.

511
00:38:16,482 --> 00:38:18,774
Unwanted tension
can put us in trouble.

512
00:38:19,107 --> 00:38:20,487
Everything is okay.

513
00:38:20,607 --> 00:38:22,066
If everything okay,

514
00:38:22,524 --> 00:38:24,498
then why are they coming
through the back?

515
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:27,191
Is that where you...

516
00:38:34,732 --> 00:38:36,316
Don't be scared come what may.

517
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:40,071
The bell is going to ring now.
You go and open the door.

518
00:38:40,191 --> 00:38:41,341
Why me?

519
00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:48,982
Do you trust me?

520
00:38:49,899 --> 00:38:52,055
Go on. Go.

521
00:38:52,774 --> 00:38:53,774
Go.

522
00:39:14,191 --> 00:39:15,417
What were you saying?

523
00:39:15,982 --> 00:39:17,191
When are her exams?

524
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,399
Papa.

525
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,732
They are here to meet mom.

526
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:37,024
- How are you, Vijay?
- All good, sir.

527
00:39:37,524 --> 00:39:40,274
We received a complaint against
Shiv Kulkarni in the morning.

528
00:39:40,857 --> 00:39:43,566
Saying that he abuses his wife
in his drunken stupor.

529
00:39:43,941 --> 00:39:46,325
Jenny said you two know about it.

530
00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:47,696
Yes.

531
00:39:47,816 --> 00:39:50,566
In fact,
you told her to file a complaint.

532
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:51,654
Yes.

533
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:55,399
Did it happen in front of you,
or did you hear it from Jenny?

534
00:39:55,649 --> 00:39:59,857
No, it happened in front of us,
and has happened several times before.

535
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,446
- Call them.
- Yes, sir.

536
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:11,941
This is your first and last warning.

537
00:40:12,274 --> 00:40:14,941
If I hear you abused her again,

538
00:40:15,316 --> 00:40:16,732
things can get pretty ugly for you.

539
00:40:16,964 --> 00:40:18,066
Got it?

540
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:20,482
Sir, I won't do it again.

541
00:40:20,816 --> 00:40:23,566
If he abuses you again,
then straightaway call the police.

542
00:40:25,941 --> 00:40:26,981
Okay.

543
00:42:25,274 --> 00:42:26,316
Papa!

544
00:42:26,899 --> 00:42:28,024
Papa!

545
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:30,774
Papa, please open the door!

546
00:42:31,104 --> 00:42:32,104
Papa!

547
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,425
Papa!

548
00:42:35,566 --> 00:42:36,649
Papa!

549
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:38,821
Papa, open the door! Please.

550
00:42:38,941 --> 00:42:39,779
Papa!

551
00:42:39,899 --> 00:42:42,191
Papa, open the door! Papa, please!

552
00:42:42,691 --> 00:42:46,572
Papa! Please, open the door!

553
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:49,112
Sister! Sister!

554
00:42:49,232 --> 00:42:50,816
Sister! What happened, sister?

555
00:42:51,024 --> 00:42:53,649
Mom. Papa. Sister got an attack.

556
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:55,774
Sister! Sister!

557
00:42:56,066 --> 00:42:57,279
Papa, look!

558
00:42:57,399 --> 00:42:58,196
- Anju!
- Sister!

559
00:42:58,316 --> 00:42:59,154
- Anju!
- Anju!

560
00:42:59,274 --> 00:43:00,357
- Sister!
- Anju.

561
00:43:00,774 --> 00:43:01,987
- Call the doctor.
- Yes.

562
00:43:02,107 --> 00:43:02,942
- Anju!
- Sister.

563
00:43:03,062 --> 00:43:04,062
Anju!

564
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:05,149
Anju!

565
00:43:05,774 --> 00:43:08,779
I told you two
in the last therapy session,

566
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:11,232
to maintain a stress free
environment around her.

567
00:43:11,732 --> 00:43:15,857
Unfortunately, what happened today
has triggered Anju's condition again.

568
00:43:17,357 --> 00:43:18,941
I've given her the medication.

569
00:43:19,607 --> 00:43:22,816
But pay special care
that this doesn't happen again.

570
00:43:23,066 --> 00:43:25,607
Otherwise,
it could prove to be fatal for her.

571
00:43:26,191 --> 00:43:27,441
Take care.

572
00:43:48,857 --> 00:43:49,899
Take.

573
00:43:50,816 --> 00:43:52,691
Aren't you Mary's husband?

574
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:56,566
Weren't you...

575
00:43:58,081 --> 00:43:59,232
When did you get out?

576
00:43:59,774 --> 00:44:01,833
Couple of days ago.

577
00:44:03,982 --> 00:44:05,524
Can I ask you a question?

578
00:44:05,857 --> 00:44:08,732
You must know everyone
around here. Right?

579
00:44:09,774 --> 00:44:13,316
Do let me know if I can get a job.

580
00:44:14,774 --> 00:44:18,649
Listen, do you see
that man in blue shirt?

581
00:44:18,982 --> 00:44:21,279
Ask him. He buys and sells property.

582
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:22,987
What buy and sell?

583
00:44:23,107 --> 00:44:25,274
He keeps hanging around here all day.

584
00:44:25,774 --> 00:44:28,529
Tell them, that you won't
do any other work.

585
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:31,649
Oh yeah, you can talk to Vijay.

586
00:44:31,899 --> 00:44:32,946
Vijay who?

587
00:44:33,181 --> 00:44:34,941
Salgaonkar.

588
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:36,607
Owner of Mirage Cable.

589
00:44:37,524 --> 00:44:39,566
He recently started his own theatre.

590
00:44:39,816 --> 00:44:41,899
- Peter, two cups of tea.
- Vijay.

591
00:44:43,274 --> 00:44:44,662
He is David!

592
00:44:48,607 --> 00:44:49,774
Hello, sir.

593
00:44:50,066 --> 00:44:52,112
He's looking for a job.

594
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:54,149
If there's anything
you can offer him...

595
00:44:55,816 --> 00:44:57,024
There are no jobs now.

596
00:44:57,274 --> 00:44:58,649
But come see me next week.

597
00:44:59,232 --> 00:45:00,271
Thank you.

598
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:03,399
Thank you.

599
00:45:39,024 --> 00:45:40,024
Vijay.

600
00:45:40,729 --> 00:45:42,529
What's the matter?
You're awfully quiet today.

601
00:45:43,566 --> 00:45:44,816
It's nothing.

602
00:45:45,607 --> 00:45:46,774
Bad mood.

603
00:45:47,482 --> 00:45:49,082
What happened?
Did the movie get shelved?

604
00:45:49,774 --> 00:45:53,404
No... my daughter is not well.

605
00:45:53,524 --> 00:45:55,191
Ohh, then it's okay.

606
00:45:56,107 --> 00:45:57,524
I mean...

607
00:45:57,774 --> 00:45:59,857
You don't worry, Vijay.

608
00:46:00,232 --> 00:46:02,066
Here you go.

609
00:46:02,816 --> 00:46:04,232
This will fix everything.

610
00:46:06,714 --> 00:46:12,672
It's not like Vijay isn't aware
of his responsibilities.

611
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,255
He tries his best.

612
00:46:17,922 --> 00:46:19,880
So where lies the problem?

613
00:46:22,255 --> 00:46:24,547
Vijay, just doesn't listen to me.

614
00:46:24,922 --> 00:46:29,005
I don't know
how he takes everything so lightly.

615
00:46:29,714 --> 00:46:34,464
Whereas... I feel out of breath.

616
00:46:35,255 --> 00:46:38,130
I feel suffocated.

617
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:42,047
Vijay... your luck is pretty good.

618
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,339
Your mercury is pretty strong.

619
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,422
Very sharp mind.

620
00:46:48,964 --> 00:46:50,880
But you ought to be careful.

621
00:46:52,172 --> 00:46:53,297
Why?

622
00:46:54,172 --> 00:46:58,880
Your stars reveal that the near future
is going to bring a bad spell for you.

623
00:46:59,214 --> 00:47:03,047
If you are not careful,
everything can go haywire.

624
00:47:05,922 --> 00:47:08,672
Don't let the lines
on your palm fool you, Ghalib.

625
00:47:09,547 --> 00:47:12,839
Even those without
arms have a destiny.

626
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,839
I don't believe in all this.

627
00:47:16,547 --> 00:47:22,135
I believe that a person
shapes his own destiny.

628
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:25,922
Amazing, Vijay. That's really good.

629
00:47:26,172 --> 00:47:29,380
You should tell him how you feel.

630
00:47:30,422 --> 00:47:33,922
Sister, you should try telling
him once. He will understand.

631
00:47:34,547 --> 00:47:36,755
I've tried dozens of times.

632
00:47:37,505 --> 00:47:39,797
But every time I try to talk to him,

633
00:47:40,464 --> 00:47:42,005
he shuts me up.

634
00:47:43,255 --> 00:47:46,005
Says,
"We'll have no discussion about it".

635
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:52,130
But my heart says
the threat isn't over yet.

636
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,694
In fact, it's heading in our direction
at double the speed.

637
00:47:58,505 --> 00:48:00,135
Did you receive your exam timetable?

638
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,255
Yes.

639
00:48:01,339 --> 00:48:02,547
When is it starting?

640
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,172
From the 11th.

641
00:48:04,484 --> 00:48:05,484
Okay.

642
00:48:10,714 --> 00:48:11,714
Yes, sir.

643
00:48:13,797 --> 00:48:14,797
Him?

644
00:48:17,089 --> 00:48:19,755
Okay, I'll pick him up
and bring him to you.

645
00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:22,089
Sir.

646
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:48,339
How are you, Gaitonde?

647
00:48:49,755 --> 00:48:51,380
Can't say much about earlier?

648
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,922
But I feel better now.

649
00:48:59,797 --> 00:49:02,880
So Sawant sir,
how was your lockdown?

650
00:49:03,297 --> 00:49:04,510
Must be good.

651
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,760
You were getting paid
to sit at home, after all.

652
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,714
That's not true, Gaitonde.

653
00:49:09,922 --> 00:49:11,880
We had to work
during the lockdown as well.

654
00:49:12,255 --> 00:49:14,880
But, it was a new experience though.

655
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,880
It must be a new experience for you.

656
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,922
But I've been under lockdown
for the last seven years.

657
00:49:23,464 --> 00:49:25,880
By the way,
what kind of a person is the IG sir?

658
00:49:27,028 --> 00:49:29,839
He's crazy but a genius.

659
00:49:33,714 --> 00:49:36,839
Weird but methodical.

660
00:49:41,464 --> 00:49:44,005
Every criminal has
a different pattern.

661
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,297
He understands that pattern.

662
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,797
But yes, no one can understand

663
00:49:50,214 --> 00:49:51,630
what's going on in his mind.

664
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:00,422
What do you think, Gaitonde?

665
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:02,797
Why did he call us at this late hour?

666
00:50:02,964 --> 00:50:05,255
You don't know? Are you serious?

667
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:06,802
Then it's going to be fun,

668
00:50:07,077 --> 00:50:08,469
when three buddies get together.

669
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,089
You, me and the IG (sir).

670
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:13,089
- Sir.
- Sir.

671
00:50:15,547 --> 00:50:17,047
Give me a minute, Sawant.

672
00:50:17,505 --> 00:50:18,505
Sir.

673
00:50:26,366 --> 00:50:27,880
Who is he playing chess with?

674
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,167
He'll hear you.

675
00:50:33,308 --> 00:50:35,047
He looks completely mental to me.

676
00:50:35,797 --> 00:50:38,464
All the chess pieces
are still in place.

677
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,422
He's playing the game in his mind.

678
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:46,047
Until he doesn't plot his last move,

679
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:49,172
he won't make his first move
on the board.

680
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:57,089
That's easy.

681
00:50:57,797 --> 00:50:59,719
Chess is like snakes and ladders.

682
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,755
They have snakes and these
have elephants (rook) and horses.

683
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,010
I'll teach you later.

684
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,130
Sir.

685
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:10,547
If you want to defeat the enemy,

686
00:51:10,922 --> 00:51:13,005
then learn to think like him.

687
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:16,672
Gaitonde, do you know
why I called you?

688
00:51:17,589 --> 00:51:19,547
Because, sir, I am the only officer,

689
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:23,297
who did his job with honesty,
passion and dedication.

690
00:51:24,464 --> 00:51:25,714
Except for Me era madam.

691
00:51:27,508 --> 00:51:29,172
Saurav Ganeriwala,

692
00:51:30,547 --> 00:51:32,880
owners of Parekh
and Parekh Constructions,

693
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:37,922
they told me about how honestly,
dedicatedly, and...

694
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:39,880
What was the third thing?

695
00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:41,344
Passion.

696
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:43,547
Passionately, you accepted
bribe from them.

697
00:51:48,131 --> 00:51:49,131
Sit.

698
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,464
You were called because,

699
00:51:58,714 --> 00:52:00,089
you are the only one

700
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:02,214
who was right about Vijay.

701
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:07,005
Sir, I maybe out of place here...

702
00:52:07,797 --> 00:52:10,547
I was right,
but what did I get in exchange.

703
00:52:11,422 --> 00:52:13,130
I've been on suspension
for seven years.

704
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:14,714
And that Vijay...

705
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:15,789
He's enjoying his life.

706
00:52:16,005 --> 00:52:17,380
He even started his own theatre.

707
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,464
I heard the film on last Friday
was a houseful.

708
00:52:22,525 --> 00:52:25,089
Even God sides with
the dishonest ones.

709
00:52:26,962 --> 00:52:28,922
That's why he slipped clean through.

710
00:52:30,089 --> 00:52:31,529
What do you remember about the case?

711
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:33,422
Everything. Everything, sir?

712
00:52:33,672 --> 00:52:34,368
Are you sure?

713
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:37,745
Sir, I can forget my wife's birthday,

714
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,255
but not 2nd and 3rd October.

715
00:52:42,797 --> 00:52:44,922
Sir, it all comes down to one thing.

716
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,010
Without evidence
there is nothing we can do.

717
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:49,380
We have evidence!

718
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:53,339
Me era madam, you?

719
00:52:54,413 --> 00:52:56,464
I heard you moved to London.

720
00:52:56,797 --> 00:52:59,672
Not everything we see and hear
has to be true.

721
00:53:00,153 --> 00:53:02,172
It's one thing that family taught us.

722
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:07,922
He escaped because I made the mistake
of underestimating an illiterate.

723
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:09,885
He'll slip this time

724
00:53:10,005 --> 00:53:12,922
because he made the mistake
of underestimating a mother.

725
00:53:13,504 --> 00:53:14,984
So you are involved in this case too.

726
00:53:15,169 --> 00:53:17,214
We have no involvement in this case.

727
00:53:17,775 --> 00:53:19,719
You're smart enough
to understand the rest.

728
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:22,172
Madam, you said you have evidence.

729
00:53:47,422 --> 00:53:49,214
Sub-inspector Shiv Kulkarni,

730
00:53:49,714 --> 00:53:51,089
ASI Jenny Thomas.

731
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,880
- Sir, these two are...
- Shadow police.

732
00:53:55,505 --> 00:53:57,172
They are a real couple.

733
00:53:58,692 --> 00:54:02,797
Knocking down your enemy's defence
without a fight, is a whole lot of fun.

734
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:04,714
- Am I right, Jenny?
- Sir.

735
00:54:06,047 --> 00:54:07,880
Sit. We'll explain you everything.

736
00:54:08,509 --> 00:54:11,422
Ta run and I have been good
friends since the Academy days.

737
00:54:11,672 --> 00:54:13,922
Since the day he was posted in Goa,

738
00:54:14,172 --> 00:54:17,047
he started tracking
every information related to Vijay.

739
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:21,630
And as soon as we found out, that
Vijay wants to sell a part of his land,

740
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,880
together we made a plan.

741
00:54:24,922 --> 00:54:26,922
I bought that land in Shiv's name.

742
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:30,719
And Shiv and Jenny have been
keeping an eye on his entire family,

743
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:32,880
for the last two years
as their neighbours.

744
00:54:33,089 --> 00:54:37,464
In fact, we even put recording devices
all over Vijay's house.

745
00:54:37,911 --> 00:54:38,719
Right, Shiv?

746
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:39,839
Right, ma'am.

747
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:40,901
That's not all.

748
00:54:41,021 --> 00:54:44,510
We even recorded every conversation
between Nandini and Jenny,

749
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:46,630
even those that happened
outside the house.

750
00:54:47,177 --> 00:54:49,297
But our problem is Vijay Salgaonkar.

751
00:54:49,797 --> 00:54:50,880
He's very smart.

752
00:54:51,214 --> 00:54:54,214
He's completely forbidden them
to discuss anything about this case.

753
00:54:54,422 --> 00:54:56,339
But we finally got a breakthrough.

754
00:54:58,714 --> 00:55:01,130
I've tried dozens of times.

755
00:55:02,005 --> 00:55:04,464
But every time I try to talk to him,

756
00:55:05,089 --> 00:55:06,880
he shuts me up.

757
00:55:07,005 --> 00:55:09,797
Says,
"We'll have no discussion about it".

758
00:55:10,505 --> 00:55:14,589
But my heart says
the threat isn't over yet.

759
00:55:15,635 --> 00:55:18,130
In fact, it's heading in
our direction at double the speed.

760
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,250
Sister...

761
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,922
are you afraid that Anju might get anxious
tell someone where the body is.

762
00:55:28,422 --> 00:55:30,297
Anju doesn't know anything.

763
00:55:31,797 --> 00:55:35,339
Vijay moved the body next day
without our knowledge.

764
00:55:37,468 --> 00:55:39,839
He says, it's best if we don't know.

765
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:42,255
The case,

766
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,172
presented us with
three important questions.

767
00:55:47,422 --> 00:55:49,422
Who moved Sam's body?

768
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:50,922
When?

769
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,130
And where?

770
00:55:53,909 --> 00:55:56,589
Now two of our questions
have been answered.

771
00:55:57,028 --> 00:55:58,135
Vijay moved the body,

772
00:55:58,255 --> 00:56:00,214
and he did it on the
next day of the murder.

773
00:56:00,755 --> 00:56:01,880
But where?

774
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:06,547
Someone must have,

775
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,714
seen Vijay that night.

776
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:18,005
Before reading the case,
I read the person.

777
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,922
Vijay Salgaonkar,

778
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:24,589
is a smart man.

779
00:56:25,755 --> 00:56:28,214
And smart people
often have a weakness.

780
00:56:29,214 --> 00:56:31,922
They think everyone else is dumb.

781
00:56:33,422 --> 00:56:34,714
But, Vijay...

782
00:56:37,714 --> 00:56:39,339
He's not one of them.

783
00:56:43,422 --> 00:56:45,427
I've heard he's been pretty busy.

784
00:56:45,547 --> 00:56:47,065
From what I could make out
from my conversations with sister...

785
00:56:47,089 --> 00:56:48,089
Sister?

786
00:56:49,047 --> 00:56:50,172
I am sorry.

787
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:53,255
Nandini was saying
that Vijay's making some film.

788
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,464
Let him make his film.

789
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,755
He'll start his film,

790
00:57:01,922 --> 00:57:03,630
but we'll write the ending.

791
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:28,700
The date and time
is very important in this case.

792
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:30,783
So let's recap the events, okay.

793
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:33,616
Sam gets murdered
on the night of October 2nd.

794
00:57:36,158 --> 00:57:38,663
Vijay returns home
on the morning of October 3rd,

795
00:57:38,783 --> 00:57:41,658
and pushes Sam's car in the quarry.

796
00:57:44,075 --> 00:57:46,621
Later, to support his story,

797
00:57:46,741 --> 00:57:48,700
Vijay start's building false evidence.

798
00:57:49,158 --> 00:57:50,246
Bus tickets.

799
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:52,621
Getting his face intentionally
recorded at the ATM.

800
00:57:52,741 --> 00:57:54,205
Movie tickets, etcetera.

801
00:57:54,325 --> 00:57:56,075
Later he returns home.

802
00:57:56,616 --> 00:57:57,908
Once everyone's asleep,

803
00:57:58,491 --> 00:58:00,700
he shifts the body
at around 1 o'clock.

804
00:58:02,533 --> 00:58:05,575
Vijay must have returned home by 4:30.

805
00:58:06,408 --> 00:58:10,491
Because they all went to Panjim
by the 5:30 bus.

806
00:58:10,908 --> 00:58:12,991
In this 3.5 hour window,

807
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:17,408
it must have taken 2 hours for him to
dig out the body and bury it properly.

808
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:19,663
This leaves him
with 1.5 hours for travelling?

809
00:58:19,783 --> 00:58:23,200
Which means he buried the body

810
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:27,871
somewhere within
45 kilometre radius of his house.

811
00:58:27,991 --> 00:58:31,746
We dug up the forest area
and Vijay's warehouse.

812
00:58:31,866 --> 00:58:32,913
But found nothing.

813
00:58:33,033 --> 00:58:35,075
Which brings me to my final point.

814
00:58:35,741 --> 00:58:37,825
To know the accurate location,

815
00:58:38,575 --> 00:58:42,616
it's crucial to find
the exact time and route.

816
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:48,616
Start asking everyone
who was working in that area.

817
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:51,621
Newspaper boys, milkmen...

818
00:58:51,741 --> 00:58:54,366
They get to work by 3 or 4 am.

819
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:56,491
Someone must have seen him.

820
00:58:57,241 --> 00:58:59,288
Sir, people are cooperating,

821
00:58:59,408 --> 00:59:02,116
but we haven't found
any important information yet.

822
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,330
Do one thing.

823
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,866
Spread the news,

824
00:59:06,366 --> 00:59:09,580
whoever gives any new
information linked to this case,

825
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,538
will be rewarded half
a million by the police.

826
00:59:11,658 --> 00:59:13,205
Sir, it's government money.

827
00:59:13,325 --> 00:59:14,538
If we give away 500,000...

828
00:59:14,658 --> 00:59:16,996
Who told you to give the money away?

829
00:59:17,116 --> 00:59:18,663
Use your wit.

830
00:59:18,783 --> 00:59:20,116
I get it, sir.

831
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:23,246
Think. Think.

832
00:59:23,366 --> 00:59:24,700
Stress your mind.

833
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,913
I can't remember, sir.

834
00:59:27,033 --> 00:59:28,746
How many guys have you employed?

835
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:31,783
- Only one.
- And you can't remember?

836
00:59:33,616 --> 00:59:35,283
Tell me, if you remember anything.

837
00:59:35,616 --> 00:59:36,616
Okay, sir.

838
00:59:36,658 --> 00:59:37,950
And one more thing...

839
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:42,075
Send two litres of milk and
two kilo cottage cheese to my house.

840
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:43,533
I will, sir.

841
00:59:43,991 --> 00:59:46,496
Sir, the Dalhousie Club
near Vijay's house,

842
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,575
was hosting an annual function
on October 3rd.

843
00:59:48,741 --> 00:59:52,700
A Kokani drama called
'Tho Maka Naka' played till midnight.

844
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:55,616
There were 60 people
who attended the show.

845
00:59:55,741 --> 00:59:58,366
One of them is Vijay's neighbour.

846
01:00:00,658 --> 01:00:02,616
Go and question him right now.

847
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,658
But sir, he cannot say anything
with certainty.

848
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,283
What?

849
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:22,158
Hey Subash Salvi, how are you?

850
01:00:24,241 --> 01:00:25,913
I had a question for you.

851
01:00:26,033 --> 01:00:27,908
On the night of October 3rd, 2014,

852
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,700
you and your wife

853
01:00:30,408 --> 01:00:32,866
went to see a Konkani drama
called 'Tho Maka Naka'.

854
01:00:33,241 --> 01:00:34,450
At the Dalhousie Club.

855
01:00:34,658 --> 01:00:35,830
I did...

856
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:39,163
But I am not certain
that it was the same date.

857
01:00:39,283 --> 01:00:41,033
Again you've started.

858
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:48,121
See... passes to that drama.

859
01:00:48,241 --> 01:00:50,371
Look closely. What's the date on it?

860
01:00:50,491 --> 01:00:52,788
It must be 3rd if it's mentioned here.

861
01:00:52,908 --> 01:00:56,163
So when you guys were returning
home after watching the drama,

862
01:00:56,283 --> 01:01:01,413
did you guys see Vijay Salgaonkar
get in his car and go anywhere?

863
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:04,996
No sir, I didn't
see Vijay go anywhere.

864
01:01:05,116 --> 01:01:08,033
See Sawant sir, I told you.

865
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,408
Coming here is pointless.

866
01:01:11,158 --> 01:01:13,163
So you didn't see Vijay that night?

867
01:01:13,283 --> 01:01:14,450
No, sir.

868
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:18,575
Wait a minute.

869
01:01:19,116 --> 01:01:20,450
Now I remember...

870
01:01:20,908 --> 01:01:23,246
I did see Vijay that night...

871
01:01:23,366 --> 01:01:26,408
At around 4:00-4:30?

872
01:01:26,887 --> 01:01:29,200
- Are you sure?
- I am, sir.

873
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:33,283
That day my wife suffered
a brutal asthma attack in the morning.

874
01:01:33,658 --> 01:01:36,283
I ran to the medical store.

875
01:01:36,741 --> 01:01:37,913
Asthma spray.

876
01:01:38,033 --> 01:01:40,496
While I was returning home
with the spray,

877
01:01:40,616 --> 01:01:44,991
I saw Vijay enter
his house in his jeep.

878
01:01:45,908 --> 01:01:48,663
And I can say that
with certainty, sir.

879
01:01:48,878 --> 01:01:50,038
Is that so?

880
01:01:50,158 --> 01:01:53,496
Then why didn't you tell us this
with certainty,

881
01:01:53,616 --> 01:01:55,176
when the investigation
was still in progress.

882
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,538
You just asked whether Vijay was...

883
01:01:57,658 --> 01:01:58,658
It's okay.

884
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:01,616
Where does the road on which
Vijay was coming back from lead to?

885
01:02:02,033 --> 01:02:05,258
It's a shortcut to
Vijay's cable office.

886
01:02:05,783 --> 01:02:08,538
He couldn't have gone
beyond 15 kilometres.

887
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:10,408
This is a residential area.

888
01:02:10,866 --> 01:02:13,048
And St. Michael's church
is also situated here.

889
01:02:13,491 --> 01:02:16,908
Sir, could he have buried
the body in that area.

890
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:19,408
If anyone digs a ditch there,

891
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:23,163
the locals will immediately know.
It's too risky.

892
01:02:23,283 --> 01:02:26,121
Sir, according to Shiv
and Jenny's report, it seems like,

893
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:28,658
Vijay Salgaonkar is pretty confident.

894
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:31,283
That the police
can never find that spot.

895
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:33,075
I see...

896
01:02:33,908 --> 01:02:37,413
So a place we can never imagine.

897
01:02:37,533 --> 01:02:39,658
Like the St.
Michael's church cemetery.

898
01:02:40,783 --> 01:02:43,325
And anyway, sir,
no one goes there at night.

899
01:02:43,616 --> 01:02:45,538
So it can be a good news for us.

900
01:02:45,658 --> 01:02:48,325
If it's true,
then it's more of a bad news.

901
01:02:48,741 --> 01:02:51,538
Several people have been
buried there over the years.

902
01:02:51,747 --> 01:02:54,553
Someone's father, son, or sister.

903
01:02:55,075 --> 01:02:57,033
We cannot start
digging up the place like this.

904
01:02:57,325 --> 01:03:00,033
And sir, there's also
the question of people's faith.

905
01:03:02,075 --> 01:03:03,908
When people get furious,

906
01:03:05,116 --> 01:03:06,616
they get awfully violent!

907
01:03:11,908 --> 01:03:15,741
The enemy often presents you
an opportunity to defeat him.

908
01:03:17,741 --> 01:03:23,408
I do have a way to find out
whether the body's there or not.

909
01:03:27,658 --> 01:03:29,616
Anu, I am studying. Turn off the TV.

910
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:32,991
At least reduce the volume.

911
01:03:33,866 --> 01:03:35,075
Go inside and study.

912
01:03:35,408 --> 01:03:36,616
You...

913
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,033
Mom, look at Anu.
She is irritating me.

914
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,741
Anu, go make some tea for me.

915
01:03:46,075 --> 01:03:47,950
Go on. Make some tea.

916
01:03:49,616 --> 01:03:51,575
You always take her side.

917
01:03:58,075 --> 01:04:02,033
Mom... fetching water was okay,
but tea...

918
01:04:02,408 --> 01:04:03,928
Aren't you expecting
too much from her?

919
01:04:04,116 --> 01:04:05,176
By the way, shall I make it?

920
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,033
No, she is making it.

921
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:23,700
Mom...

922
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:29,658
Mrs. Salgaonkar?

923
01:05:30,241 --> 01:05:31,741
- Yes.
- Hello.

924
01:05:32,158 --> 01:05:33,246
Ta run Ah law at.

925
01:05:33,366 --> 01:05:35,116
Inspector General Goa Police.

926
01:05:38,991 --> 01:05:40,116
Police?

927
01:05:40,658 --> 01:05:41,991
Cops and robbers.

928
01:05:42,816 --> 01:05:44,116
Same.

929
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:47,991
Can I come inside and speak with you?

930
01:05:51,116 --> 01:05:52,116
Yes.

931
01:05:59,075 --> 01:06:00,991
I wanted to speak with your husband.

932
01:06:03,491 --> 01:06:04,700
He isn't at home.

933
01:06:08,283 --> 01:06:09,325
Doesn't matter.

934
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,866
I'll wait for him here.

935
01:06:25,825 --> 01:06:27,325
Hello.

936
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,241
You have an interesting garden.

937
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,116
Reminds me of something.

938
01:06:39,825 --> 01:06:41,783
Is there a problem, sir?

939
01:06:43,658 --> 01:06:45,033
This is the problem!

940
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,575
People think there's a problem
when they see us.

941
01:06:49,033 --> 01:06:50,658
Whereas the truth us,

942
01:06:52,366 --> 01:06:58,283
that the police are at your service
all the time.

943
01:06:58,658 --> 01:06:59,991
Mom.

944
01:07:02,408 --> 01:07:03,575
For me?

945
01:07:12,825 --> 01:07:14,408
Did you add sugar?

946
01:07:16,408 --> 01:07:17,908
Two spoons.

947
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:27,491
We work hard for you.

948
01:07:30,866 --> 01:07:36,205
We don't want the innocent
to be punished,

949
01:07:36,325 --> 01:07:38,158
and the guilty to escape.

950
01:07:39,325 --> 01:07:43,200
So you don't have to be afraid of us
unnecessarily.

951
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,908
Yup... if you've done something wrong.

952
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:49,658
Like theft...

953
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,950
murder...

954
01:07:56,283 --> 01:07:58,158
Then you should be scared.

955
01:08:00,325 --> 01:08:01,700
And it's also logical.

956
01:08:03,116 --> 01:08:05,741
Because then we'll catch you
and put you in jail.

957
01:08:07,158 --> 01:08:10,741
After that your life is over.

958
01:08:17,491 --> 01:08:18,741
Finished.

959
01:08:24,908 --> 01:08:26,177
Anyway...

960
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:30,031
can I use your washroom?

961
01:09:00,825 --> 01:09:03,075
Oh, God!

962
01:10:06,366 --> 01:10:09,158
What a sweet, law-abiding family!

963
01:10:16,033 --> 01:10:17,075
Touch wood.

964
01:10:18,658 --> 01:10:20,991
You didn't mention
your purpose of visit here.

965
01:10:22,366 --> 01:10:24,450
Ohh... friendly visit.

966
01:10:25,575 --> 01:10:28,491
Wanted to thank you personally,
for the Jennifer Thomas case.

967
01:10:30,241 --> 01:10:33,866
I wish every citizen respected the law
like your husband.

968
01:10:38,366 --> 01:10:41,491
Unfortunately, we couldn't meet today.

969
01:10:42,116 --> 01:10:45,575
But do tell him I'll
be seeing him soon.

970
01:10:49,283 --> 01:10:50,408
See you.

971
01:11:11,783 --> 01:11:13,866
Is someone under a lot of stress?

972
01:11:14,908 --> 01:11:15,705
Why?

973
01:11:15,825 --> 01:11:19,080
I asked because of
these jasmine flowers.

974
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,658
I have these too.

975
01:11:21,533 --> 01:11:24,033
Doctors recommend
them to reduce stress,

976
01:11:24,283 --> 01:11:26,080
plant jasmine flowers at home.

977
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,996
My husband planted these.

978
01:11:29,116 --> 01:11:35,232
Your husband's efforts
will soon be reduced to dirt.

979
01:11:36,616 --> 01:11:38,018
What?

980
01:11:38,658 --> 01:11:40,366
The soil's infested with pests.

981
01:11:40,783 --> 01:11:42,491
And once the plants get infected,

982
01:11:42,908 --> 01:11:45,426
it reduces everything to dust.

983
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,450
Pest control, madam.

984
01:11:52,658 --> 01:11:55,116
Otherwise, this can be
stressful for everyone.

985
01:11:57,991 --> 01:11:59,700
Thanks for the tea.

986
01:12:51,991 --> 01:12:53,116
Sister...

987
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:54,783
Sister, it's the police.

988
01:12:58,075 --> 01:12:59,616
The police were at the church.

989
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:03,700
Rumour is, that's where
Vijay hid the body.

990
01:13:05,491 --> 01:13:07,658
Call Vijay home immediately.

991
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,658
It won't be right to talk about it
on the phone.

992
01:13:12,908 --> 01:13:14,075
Yes.

993
01:13:14,575 --> 01:13:15,763
Yes. Yes.

994
01:13:18,658 --> 01:13:20,818
Yes, I'll sign the agreement papers
and send them back.

995
01:13:20,981 --> 01:13:22,575
Yes. Thank you.

996
01:13:23,825 --> 01:13:24,830
Yes, Nandini?

997
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:27,913
Vijay, come home immediately.

998
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:28,871
What's wrong?

999
01:13:28,991 --> 01:13:31,671
I cannot tell you anything on
the phone. Just come home immediately.

1000
01:13:39,116 --> 01:13:40,329
Sister...

1001
01:13:47,658 --> 01:13:48,908
What's wrong?

1002
01:13:54,616 --> 01:13:56,136
Are you going to tell me what's wrong?

1003
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:00,533
The IG came to our house today.

1004
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:02,783
That's not all.

1005
01:14:03,575 --> 01:14:06,700
The police are searching for
the body at St. Michael's church.

1006
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:11,325
I thought the police
has closed this case down.

1007
01:14:11,871 --> 01:14:14,200
But they are still investigating.

1008
01:14:15,158 --> 01:14:17,991
Nandini, they will keep investigating
as long as we're alive.

1009
01:14:18,366 --> 01:14:19,621
But they won't find anything.

1010
01:14:19,741 --> 01:14:21,866
So the body
isn't at St. Michaels's church.

1011
01:14:22,283 --> 01:14:25,116
I've told you dozens of times.
We will not discuss this.

1012
01:14:30,283 --> 01:14:36,033
When I called you home, in a hurry,
it made you nervous, didn't it?

1013
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:45,075
Ever imagined the ordeal
I've been through.

1014
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:50,455
Whenever I hear
that the police are investigating,

1015
01:14:50,575 --> 01:14:54,866
my hands and feet go numb.

1016
01:14:55,491 --> 01:15:00,075
I know Vijay,
you're doing it for our safety.

1017
01:15:00,575 --> 01:15:07,325
But... for my sake, can't you tell me?

1018
01:15:09,533 --> 01:15:11,325
Tell me something.

1019
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:16,729
I am not crazy
to tell any random person.

1020
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,721
Or you don't trust me.

1021
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,950
If you don't, then it's okay.

1022
01:15:39,866 --> 01:15:42,158
Nandini, wait.

1023
01:15:53,075 --> 01:15:55,158
Between my heart and mind,

1024
01:15:56,283 --> 01:15:58,450
I've always followed my mind.

1025
01:15:59,908 --> 01:16:01,198
And today...

1026
01:16:04,325 --> 01:16:05,908
I will do the same.

1027
01:16:08,241 --> 01:16:09,427
Forgive me.

1028
01:16:12,658 --> 01:16:14,253
I cannot tell you.

1029
01:16:35,325 --> 01:16:37,325
Between my heart and mind,

1030
01:16:38,283 --> 01:16:40,075
I've always followed my mind.

1031
01:16:42,033 --> 01:16:43,200
And today...

1032
01:16:44,408 --> 01:16:46,075
I will do the same.

1033
01:16:47,408 --> 01:16:48,741
Forgive me.

1034
01:16:49,741 --> 01:16:51,658
I cannot tell you.

1035
01:17:15,581 --> 01:17:18,331
Martin, did I miss the bus to Panjim?

1036
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:21,039
There's one leaving every 15 minutes.

1037
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:22,377
I see...

1038
01:17:22,497 --> 01:17:23,914
Give me a cup of tea.

1039
01:17:24,331 --> 01:17:25,414
Right away.

1040
01:17:26,206 --> 01:17:27,289
Peter.

1041
01:17:32,997 --> 01:17:34,122
Vijay sir.

1042
01:17:37,414 --> 01:17:40,627
Sorry, but it slipped my mind
to look for a job for you.

1043
01:17:40,747 --> 01:17:41,747
Doesn't matter.

1044
01:17:41,789 --> 01:17:43,669
I'm appreciate that
you gave it a thought.

1045
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:45,497
And I found a job in Panjim.

1046
01:17:46,164 --> 01:17:47,502
Congratulations for the job.

1047
01:17:47,622 --> 01:17:48,627
- Thank you...
- Vijay.

1048
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,289
Vinayak sir is calling you.

1049
01:17:50,706 --> 01:17:51,914
- See you.
- Okay.

1050
01:17:55,706 --> 01:17:57,763
Vijay's case has
become hot topic again.

1051
01:17:58,081 --> 01:17:59,641
The police have sprung
back into action.

1052
01:18:01,787 --> 01:18:02,829
Sit.

1053
01:18:25,204 --> 01:18:27,121
I've been hearing this every year.

1054
01:18:27,241 --> 01:18:29,662
"The police are looking here,
digging there."

1055
01:18:30,162 --> 01:18:31,621
But what do they end up with?

1056
01:18:31,996 --> 01:18:33,246
Nothing.

1057
01:18:33,579 --> 01:18:37,121
And how can they find anything
when Vijay's done nothing.

1058
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,412
Yes, Vijay.

1059
01:18:40,329 --> 01:18:41,579
What's the matter?

1060
01:18:42,037 --> 01:18:44,871
Vinayak sir, it's been seven years.

1061
01:18:45,162 --> 01:18:47,621
My family is still being harassed.

1062
01:18:48,287 --> 01:18:50,954
The police even
unlawfully assaulted us,

1063
01:18:51,412 --> 01:18:53,001
and yet we cooperated.

1064
01:18:53,121 --> 01:18:56,287
You are the only person
who thinks Vijay is innocent.

1065
01:18:56,621 --> 01:18:59,579
Vijay Salgaonkar
cleverly outsmarted everyone.

1066
01:18:59,996 --> 01:19:02,162
He definitely moved the body.

1067
01:19:02,454 --> 01:19:06,996
You make it sound like you were there,
when he was burying the body.

1068
01:19:07,287 --> 01:19:10,704
The police made me take
countless trips to the police station,

1069
01:19:11,412 --> 01:19:12,751
yet I said nothing.

1070
01:19:12,871 --> 01:19:14,667
The police is questioning
everyone again.

1071
01:19:14,787 --> 01:19:20,042
Whether anyone saw Vijay on the
night of October 2nd and 3rd, 2014.

1072
01:19:20,162 --> 01:19:23,334
I've heard whoever gives
them useful intel,

1073
01:19:23,454 --> 01:19:25,254
will be rewarded
half a million by the police.

1074
01:19:25,329 --> 01:19:26,746
Half a million!

1075
01:19:27,621 --> 01:19:29,959
- How do you know?
- I have sources.

1076
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:32,542
Source? Amazing.

1077
01:19:32,662 --> 01:19:34,541
Rocky, how is your girlfriend?

1078
01:19:34,661 --> 01:19:37,204
- Don't ask.
- I heard she got married.

1079
01:19:37,621 --> 01:19:38,621
Go ahead and laugh.

1080
01:19:38,704 --> 01:19:40,638
You'll know how it feels
when it happens with you.

1081
01:19:40,662 --> 01:19:41,912
What are these guys saying?

1082
01:19:42,246 --> 01:19:44,871
These guys talk a lot of rubbish.

1083
01:19:45,704 --> 01:19:48,829
If the IG sir has a problem,
he could have informed me.

1084
01:19:49,121 --> 01:19:50,537
I would have met him personally.

1085
01:19:51,121 --> 01:19:53,542
But my family...

1086
01:19:53,662 --> 01:19:55,126
No Vijay, you're getting it wrong.

1087
01:19:55,246 --> 01:19:56,871
It was just a friendly visit.

1088
01:19:57,371 --> 01:19:58,704
But still we'll make a note.

1089
01:20:00,787 --> 01:20:01,787
Thank you, sir.

1090
01:20:17,662 --> 01:20:20,542
Vijay Salgaonkar
cleverly duped everyone.

1091
01:20:20,662 --> 01:20:22,871
He definitely moved the body.

1092
01:20:24,912 --> 01:20:26,834
The police is questioning
everyone again.

1093
01:20:26,954 --> 01:20:31,621
Whether anyone saw Vijay on the
night of October 2nd and 3rd, 2014.

1094
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:38,329
You make it sound like you were
there, when he was burying the body.

1095
01:21:23,386 --> 01:21:26,542
I've heard whoever gives
them useful intel,

1096
01:21:26,662 --> 01:21:28,744
will be rewarded
half a million by the police.

1097
01:21:38,621 --> 01:21:39,621
Sir.

1098
01:22:01,204 --> 01:22:02,329
Hello.

1099
01:22:14,746 --> 01:22:16,917
Sorry sir,
for calling you at this hour.

1100
01:22:17,037 --> 01:22:18,626
It's okay. Who is he?

1101
01:22:18,746 --> 01:22:21,204
He's served seven years in jail
for a murder case.

1102
01:22:21,829 --> 01:22:25,251
Says he knows
where Vijay Salgaonkar hid the body.

1103
01:22:25,371 --> 01:22:26,537
Where is the body?

1104
01:22:26,871 --> 01:22:28,042
He isn't saying anything.

1105
01:22:28,162 --> 01:22:30,417
Says he'll only tell a senior officer.

1106
01:22:30,537 --> 01:22:31,834
Can we believe him?

1107
01:22:31,954 --> 01:22:35,204
Several people wasted our
time like this for the reward.

1108
01:22:37,412 --> 01:22:40,787
You are right. But can we let him go
without hearing him first?

1109
01:22:41,537 --> 01:22:43,116
Of course, not.

1110
01:22:55,912 --> 01:22:57,246
What is your name?

1111
01:22:57,579 --> 01:22:58,871
David Braganza.

1112
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:01,454
David Braganza!

1113
01:23:03,954 --> 01:23:06,121
Did you see Vijay
Salgaonkar that night?

1114
01:23:07,287 --> 01:23:08,412
Yes, I did.

1115
01:23:08,912 --> 01:23:10,454
Where did he hide the body?

1116
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:15,584
Sir, I will tell you everything.

1117
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:18,579
But I want money
in exchange of information.

1118
01:23:19,246 --> 01:23:20,376
How much?

1119
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:21,787
Two and a half million rupees.

1120
01:23:22,954 --> 01:23:24,079
See...

1121
01:23:24,787 --> 01:23:26,412
I told you he's a fraud.

1122
01:23:27,121 --> 01:23:30,084
I saw Salgaonkar
on the night of October 3rd.

1123
01:23:30,204 --> 01:23:33,376
He was carrying a shovel,
and his jeep was parked outside.

1124
01:23:33,496 --> 01:23:34,621
I saw him.

1125
01:23:36,829 --> 01:23:38,746
Actually, sir, you see,

1126
01:23:39,162 --> 01:23:40,834
I committed a murder that night.

1127
01:23:40,954 --> 01:23:42,579
And I was running from the police.

1128
01:23:42,871 --> 01:23:44,621
That's when I saw him.

1129
01:23:44,996 --> 01:23:46,155
- I see.
- Yes.

1130
01:23:46,954 --> 01:23:48,079
What time?

1131
01:23:48,537 --> 01:23:49,981
3 or 3:30.

1132
01:23:53,037 --> 01:23:54,496
Caught you.

1133
01:23:56,621 --> 01:23:58,959
Vijay buried the body at 1 o'clock.

1134
01:23:59,079 --> 01:24:01,716
No, sir. It was 3:30.

1135
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:03,626
And you know that as well.

1136
01:24:03,746 --> 01:24:05,792
I am not lying.

1137
01:24:05,912 --> 01:24:09,001
I won't say a word
until I don't get paid.

1138
01:24:09,496 --> 01:24:12,537
Fine, we'll give you... 10,000.
Speak up.

1139
01:24:12,746 --> 01:24:14,126
I am not a beggar.

1140
01:24:14,246 --> 01:24:16,251
Why you?

1141
01:24:16,371 --> 01:24:17,917
Trying to be over-smart, are you?

1142
01:24:18,037 --> 01:24:18,917
Now watch.

1143
01:24:19,037 --> 01:24:23,084
How I get the intel from you
without paying a penny?

1144
01:24:23,331 --> 01:24:25,542
You can do anything you want, sir.

1145
01:24:25,662 --> 01:24:26,959
I spent seven years in jail.

1146
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:29,417
I've grown used to this.
You don't scare me.

1147
01:24:29,537 --> 01:24:32,709
I made a big mistake.
I shouldn't have come to the police.

1148
01:24:32,829 --> 01:24:34,792
I should have gone
to Salgaonkar instead.

1149
01:24:34,912 --> 01:24:37,055
He would have paid me to keep
my mouth shut. I made a big mistake.

1150
01:24:37,079 --> 01:24:38,621
- I'll beat you.
- Gaitonde...

1151
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:40,996
You'll get the money.

1152
01:24:41,329 --> 01:24:42,816
Two and a half million.

1153
01:24:47,871 --> 01:24:50,329
If I find out you're lying,

1154
01:24:52,037 --> 01:24:53,579
then it won't be good for you.

1155
01:24:54,204 --> 01:24:56,037
I am not crazy, sir.

1156
01:24:56,746 --> 01:24:58,705
Why would I lie to the police?

1157
01:25:41,037 --> 01:25:42,871
Thank you. Thank you.

1158
01:25:43,412 --> 01:25:45,537
- Mr. Braganza.
- Yeah...

1159
01:25:46,912 --> 01:25:48,496
Where is the body?

1160
01:25:49,204 --> 01:25:50,709
Oh, yes. Sorry.

1161
01:25:51,172 --> 01:25:52,282
Here.

1162
01:25:53,454 --> 01:25:56,829
I mean, he buried it
right where you're standing.

1163
01:26:02,871 --> 01:26:06,042
Back then the police station
was under construction.

1164
01:26:06,162 --> 01:26:07,281
Yes.

1165
01:26:09,121 --> 01:26:10,346
It was.

1166
01:26:11,662 --> 01:26:15,842
So I saw Vijay burying it here. Yes.

1167
01:26:19,662 --> 01:26:21,374
That scoundrel.

1168
01:26:22,246 --> 01:26:26,376
Wise guy, you think
we'll believe anything you say.

1169
01:26:26,496 --> 01:26:27,496
- You...
- Gaitonde!

1170
01:26:27,579 --> 01:26:28,623
I...

1171
01:26:29,829 --> 01:26:31,871
Now it all makes sense.

1172
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:35,587
So that was his confidence.

1173
01:26:36,496 --> 01:26:39,293
A place we never could have imagined.

1174
01:26:43,829 --> 01:26:45,621
Another thing, Gaitonde.

1175
01:26:46,996 --> 01:26:49,667
He stays here
until the body isn't found.

1176
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:50,787
I...

1177
01:26:54,912 --> 01:26:56,870
Welcome back to jail.

1178
01:27:02,579 --> 01:27:05,287
DGP has given us permission
to dig up the jail,

1179
01:27:05,996 --> 01:27:11,579
but we have only one day
to execute the entire operation.

1180
01:27:12,037 --> 01:27:13,871
Hire as many people you want.

1181
01:27:14,302 --> 01:27:15,371
But get it done.

1182
01:27:19,246 --> 01:27:21,454
The workers should be here
by crack of dawn.

1183
01:27:31,162 --> 01:27:32,334
And as per the rules,

1184
01:27:32,454 --> 01:27:35,522
the DSP officer has to be on site
the whole time.

1185
01:27:43,537 --> 01:27:46,496
Either the Collector or the
RDO (Revenue Department Officer)

1186
01:27:46,871 --> 01:27:48,626
Will record the investigation report.

1187
01:27:48,746 --> 01:27:50,579
Most importantly.

1188
01:27:51,201 --> 01:27:53,954
If we find the remains
of the body in that spot...

1189
01:27:54,287 --> 01:27:55,954
Which I am sure we will.

1190
01:28:00,996 --> 01:28:05,162
The forensic department will immediately
take the evidence to their office,

1191
01:28:05,579 --> 01:28:08,579
and submit us the report
in a couple of days.

1192
01:28:09,246 --> 01:28:10,618
- Clear?
- Yes, sir!

1193
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:16,417
Didn't have breakfast in the morning?

1194
01:28:16,537 --> 01:28:17,876
Hurry up!

1195
01:28:17,996 --> 01:28:20,204
Move your hands faster! Quickly.

1196
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:23,454
Where are you going?

1197
01:28:23,954 --> 01:28:24,792
To pee.

1198
01:28:24,912 --> 01:28:26,876
You shouldn't have
had a buck load of water.

1199
01:28:26,996 --> 01:28:29,121
Control it. Back to work.

1200
01:28:29,454 --> 01:28:30,621
Pick up the shovel.

1201
01:28:31,162 --> 01:28:32,162
Good.

1202
01:28:32,579 --> 01:28:34,204
You'll work faster under pressure.

1203
01:28:34,704 --> 01:28:37,209
But sir, why are we digging?

1204
01:28:37,329 --> 01:28:39,626
For Shahjahan's treasure.

1205
01:28:39,746 --> 01:28:42,667
If we succeed,
you will each get a share.

1206
01:28:42,787 --> 01:28:43,954
Now hurry up!

1207
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:57,954
Pray that we find it.

1208
01:28:58,662 --> 01:29:03,746
Otherwise, I'll turn this
into your grave. Yes.

1209
01:29:04,746 --> 01:29:06,184
Come on, hurry up.

1210
01:29:15,787 --> 01:29:18,167
Wait. Where are you going?

1211
01:29:18,287 --> 01:29:19,792
Sir ordered tea.

1212
01:29:19,912 --> 01:29:21,579
Keep it here. We'll take it inside.

1213
01:29:27,329 --> 01:29:28,329
Peter.

1214
01:29:29,162 --> 01:29:30,682
What's going on at the police station?

1215
01:29:30,787 --> 01:29:32,001
I don't know.

1216
01:29:32,121 --> 01:29:34,121
Guess, they are digging something up.

1217
01:29:57,037 --> 01:29:58,621
Stop!

1218
01:29:59,787 --> 01:30:01,912
Stop. Come out. Come out.

1219
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,805
Once the application comes, I'll...

1220
01:30:19,829 --> 01:30:21,537
Sir. Found it!

1221
01:30:46,746 --> 01:30:48,668
- Hurry up.
- Coming.

1222
01:30:48,897 --> 01:30:50,662
You've been saying
that for over 20 minutes.

1223
01:31:07,454 --> 01:31:08,292
Hello.

1224
01:31:08,412 --> 01:31:10,079
Jose, where are you?

1225
01:31:10,329 --> 01:31:11,746
Having lunch.

1226
01:31:11,954 --> 01:31:14,542
Please don't say why I'm taking
so long to have lunch.

1227
01:31:14,662 --> 01:31:17,102
- You know how Martin's been recently...
- Did I say anything?

1228
01:31:18,121 --> 01:31:21,787
Listen, why is there a crowd
in front of the police station?

1229
01:31:22,121 --> 01:31:24,037
Don't know.
Some kind of work in progress.

1230
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:25,621
What work?

1231
01:31:25,954 --> 01:31:27,829
They are digging for something.

1232
01:31:30,121 --> 01:31:31,233
Hello?

1233
01:31:32,537 --> 01:31:33,537
Hello?

1234
01:31:33,645 --> 01:31:34,847
I'll call you back.

1235
01:31:44,146 --> 01:31:45,430
What happened, Vijay?

1236
01:31:46,537 --> 01:31:48,876
Go back inside.
I must go someplace else right now.

1237
01:31:48,996 --> 01:31:51,287
What's wrong, Vijay?
What are you hiding?

1238
01:31:54,121 --> 01:31:57,167
No one steps out of the house
until I don't come back.

1239
01:31:57,287 --> 01:31:58,696
Close all the doors.

1240
01:32:00,871 --> 01:32:02,746
What's in the police station?

1241
01:32:07,037 --> 01:32:09,371
Is it where you hide the body...

1242
01:32:11,537 --> 01:32:12,996
Whatever it takes,

1243
01:32:14,121 --> 01:32:15,996
I won't let anything happen
to all of you.

1244
01:34:47,871 --> 01:34:48,871
- Ma'am...
- Ma'am! Ma'am!

1245
01:34:48,954 --> 01:34:50,601
Ma'am, a body was found
in the police station.

1246
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:51,667
Is this a police failure?

1247
01:34:51,787 --> 01:34:54,501
Ma'am, will Vijay
Salgaonkar will be arrested?

1248
01:34:54,621 --> 01:34:56,861
- Ma'am, will Vijay Salgaonkar...
- Is this incompetence?

1249
01:34:56,912 --> 01:34:58,751
Ma'am, a body was found
in the police station.

1250
01:34:58,871 --> 01:35:00,638
Ma'am, a body was found
in the police station.

1251
01:35:00,662 --> 01:35:02,462
Sir, a body was found
in the police station...

1252
01:35:03,912 --> 01:35:05,746
What will be our next move?

1253
01:35:06,162 --> 01:35:08,829
We've filed a petition
to question him.

1254
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:11,079
The court hearing is at 1 o'clock.

1255
01:35:11,787 --> 01:35:13,097
After that it's just a matter of time.

1256
01:35:13,121 --> 01:35:16,662
Ta run, he's very clever.
Don't give him time to think.

1257
01:35:18,162 --> 01:35:19,662
Has the forensic report arrived?

1258
01:35:22,621 --> 01:35:23,746
Thank you.

1259
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:28,621
Age between 15-20 years.

1260
01:35:29,537 --> 01:35:30,787
Male.

1261
01:35:31,537 --> 01:35:33,162
Crack on the skull.

1262
01:35:35,329 --> 01:35:39,287
Died due to trauma to the head.

1263
01:35:45,579 --> 01:35:47,579
We'll have to send it for DNA testing.

1264
01:35:48,787 --> 01:35:51,954
And we'll need your blood
samples for that.

1265
01:36:00,371 --> 01:36:01,829
Based on these findings,

1266
01:36:02,121 --> 01:36:04,209
the court grants permission
to the police,

1267
01:36:04,329 --> 01:36:07,329
to question the Salgaonkar family
for eight hours.

1268
01:36:07,662 --> 01:36:12,496
Please tell your client to be present
at 8 am tomorrow for police questioning.

1269
01:36:12,704 --> 01:36:13,542
Yes, sir.

1270
01:36:13,662 --> 01:36:14,746
That will be all.

1271
01:36:14,996 --> 01:36:16,204
Court is dismissed.

1272
01:36:24,895 --> 01:36:26,650
Our entire defence
hangs on your statement

1273
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:28,567
that you don't know anything.

1274
01:36:28,687 --> 01:36:31,317
Doesn't matter what happens inside,
stay firm on your statement.

1275
01:36:31,437 --> 01:36:32,437
Understood?

1276
01:36:32,687 --> 01:36:33,687
All the best.

1277
01:36:45,645 --> 01:36:47,770
'Shanti. Seva. Nyay.'

1278
01:36:50,478 --> 01:36:51,645
...Nyay

1279
01:36:51,895 --> 01:36:54,353
Which everyone expects from us.

1280
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:58,437
Especially the dead.

1281
01:36:59,812 --> 01:37:01,603
Isn't that right, Mr. Salgaonkar?

1282
01:37:03,312 --> 01:37:05,312
I am very glad to meet you.

1283
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:11,103
Big fan.

1284
01:37:15,187 --> 01:37:16,645
And Mrs. Salgaonkar.

1285
01:37:18,645 --> 01:37:20,353
How are the jasmine flowers?

1286
01:37:21,395 --> 01:37:23,145
You must be missing them.

1287
01:37:25,145 --> 01:37:26,228
Anyway,

1288
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:28,770
how is your general knowledge?

1289
01:37:31,228 --> 01:37:34,645
There is a commonality between
Lal Bahadur Shashtri and Gandhiji.

1290
01:37:35,353 --> 01:37:36,437
Do you know what?

1291
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,603
You tell me.

1292
01:37:45,062 --> 01:37:46,062
Well...

1293
01:37:47,103 --> 01:37:48,645
you should know.

1294
01:37:52,270 --> 01:37:53,395
God...

1295
01:37:54,353 --> 01:37:55,645
Let me tell you.

1296
01:37:57,020 --> 01:38:00,895
Their birthdays fall on October 2nd.

1297
01:38:01,312 --> 01:38:03,603
Another event happened on October 2nd.

1298
01:38:05,103 --> 01:38:06,395
Can you guess?

1299
01:38:12,312 --> 01:38:13,353
Pass?

1300
01:38:16,145 --> 01:38:17,150
Okay.

1301
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:18,437
Round 2.

1302
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:25,853
Do you recognise me?

1303
01:38:28,645 --> 01:38:29,978
I've met him a couple of times,

1304
01:38:30,228 --> 01:38:31,645
but don't know him personally.

1305
01:38:35,062 --> 01:38:38,103
But he knows you pretty well.

1306
01:38:41,353 --> 01:38:43,478
His name is David Braganza.

1307
01:38:44,853 --> 01:38:46,108
What was his statement?

1308
01:38:46,228 --> 01:38:49,567
He claims that on the night
of October 3rd 2014,

1309
01:38:49,687 --> 01:38:53,733
he saw Vijay coming out
of the station at around 3:30.

1310
01:38:53,853 --> 01:38:55,187
Are you serious?

1311
01:38:56,062 --> 01:38:57,358
What else did he see?

1312
01:38:57,478 --> 01:38:59,103
Vijay was carrying a shovel.

1313
01:38:59,603 --> 01:39:01,187
Mr. Salgaonkar,

1314
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:03,978
what is he saying?

1315
01:39:05,145 --> 01:39:06,312
Do tell.

1316
01:39:07,770 --> 01:39:11,312
Leaving your sweet,
beautiful family at home,

1317
01:39:11,603 --> 01:39:13,478
what were you trying to dig up

1318
01:39:14,145 --> 01:39:18,478
at the police station
with a shovel at three in the night?

1319
01:39:19,478 --> 01:39:23,437
Sir, either he's lying
or he saw someone else.

1320
01:39:23,687 --> 01:39:24,770
I see...

1321
01:39:25,478 --> 01:39:26,687
I've never been there.

1322
01:39:26,978 --> 01:39:29,145
Be it day or night.

1323
01:39:29,853 --> 01:39:31,853
On October 20142nd

1324
01:39:32,187 --> 01:39:34,525
we were attending Swami Chinmayanand's
religious gathering.

1325
01:39:34,645 --> 01:39:35,775
Really?

1326
01:39:35,895 --> 01:39:38,275
- On October 3rd, we were...
- Wait a minute.

1327
01:39:38,395 --> 01:39:40,395
Can you repeat all that for her?

1328
01:39:49,353 --> 01:39:51,645
Let me continue
the story for them, Ta run.

1329
01:39:54,645 --> 01:39:57,687
They had 'Pav-bhaji' in Panjim.

1330
01:40:00,895 --> 01:40:02,395
Watched a film.

1331
01:40:04,728 --> 01:40:06,145
Etcetera. Etcetera.

1332
01:40:13,562 --> 01:40:14,562
Don't be afraid.

1333
01:40:14,645 --> 01:40:16,312
I won't ask you anything again,

1334
01:40:16,853 --> 01:40:19,353
because you already
told us everything.

1335
01:40:23,228 --> 01:40:24,395
Confused?

1336
01:40:25,562 --> 01:40:26,937
So naive of you.

1337
01:40:27,895 --> 01:40:29,312
Let me explain.

1338
01:40:32,369 --> 01:40:33,437
Sister...

1339
01:40:33,557 --> 01:40:38,498
are you afraid that Anju might get
nervous tell someone where the body is.

1340
01:40:39,187 --> 01:40:41,103
Anju doesn't know anything.

1341
01:40:41,645 --> 01:40:45,312
Vijay moved the body next day
without our knowledge.

1342
01:40:46,978 --> 01:40:49,478
He says it's best if we don't know.

1343
01:40:59,395 --> 01:41:00,853
Don't blame yourself.

1344
01:41:02,406 --> 01:41:04,562
It's hard to find
good neighbours these days.

1345
01:41:06,645 --> 01:41:09,103
You guys were pretending
to be innocent,

1346
01:41:10,645 --> 01:41:12,770
and they were pretending
to be your neighbours.

1347
01:41:18,687 --> 01:41:19,895
Now tell us...

1348
01:41:20,853 --> 01:41:24,353
what did you do at Swami
Chinmayanand's religious gathering?

1349
01:41:28,978 --> 01:41:29,853
Okay.

1350
01:41:29,978 --> 01:41:33,853
Let's take you to my gathering.

1351
01:41:35,395 --> 01:41:36,478
Please.

1352
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:39,770
This will be fun. Come on.

1353
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,312
My time is very precious.

1354
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:55,187
So don't waste my time.

1355
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:03,687
I'll ask you three questions
about Sameer Deshmukh's murder.

1356
01:42:05,621 --> 01:42:06,645
Who did it?

1357
01:42:08,292 --> 01:42:09,437
Why...

1358
01:42:10,478 --> 01:42:11,770
and how?

1359
01:42:13,478 --> 01:42:15,187
Sir, I've said it before.

1360
01:42:15,603 --> 01:42:16,687
We weren't present.

1361
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:18,895
I don't know anything.

1362
01:42:21,103 --> 01:42:22,437
I warned you,

1363
01:42:24,353 --> 01:42:29,353
don't waste my time.

1364
01:42:43,853 --> 01:42:45,603
Come on. Come on.

1365
01:42:57,270 --> 01:42:58,853
Why did you kill Sam?

1366
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,520
I...

1367
01:43:02,812 --> 01:43:04,562
I didn't kill Sam.

1368
01:43:05,228 --> 01:43:06,437
Gaitonde.

1369
01:43:07,645 --> 01:43:10,062
Ask her how she killed Sam.

1370
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:19,270
Come on.

1371
01:43:20,103 --> 01:43:21,103
Tell us.

1372
01:43:22,353 --> 01:43:25,395
Me era madam is asking you a question.

1373
01:43:26,353 --> 01:43:27,353
Tell her.

1374
01:43:32,978 --> 01:43:34,728
- Hey...
- And remember.

1375
01:43:35,020 --> 01:43:36,353
Leave no marks.

1376
01:43:38,270 --> 01:43:39,483
Sir, what are you doing?

1377
01:43:39,603 --> 01:43:40,317
Speak up!

1378
01:43:40,437 --> 01:43:43,312
Sir! Sir, this is against the law!
You can't do this, sir!

1379
01:43:45,145 --> 01:43:46,525
Sir, you can't do this!

1380
01:43:46,645 --> 01:43:47,525
Leave her.

1381
01:43:47,645 --> 01:43:48,525
Tell us.

1382
01:43:48,645 --> 01:43:50,692
- Sir, I beg you!
- Speak up.

1383
01:43:50,812 --> 01:43:53,145
Please, sir. Sir, please stop them.

1384
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:59,108
Mr. Salgaonkar, you'll realise that,
the law's been giving you as much respect

1385
01:43:59,228 --> 01:44:00,853
as much as you've respected the law.

1386
01:44:00,978 --> 01:44:01,998
Sir...

1387
01:44:02,812 --> 01:44:04,312
Tell us.

1388
01:44:04,978 --> 01:44:06,608
- No, please...
- "Leave her, leave her."

1389
01:44:06,728 --> 01:44:09,108
- Sir, she has a condition.
- Speak up.

1390
01:44:09,228 --> 01:44:10,788
Are you going to Act dumb
this time too?

1391
01:44:10,895 --> 01:44:12,942
Are you going to throw tantrums?
Speak up.

1392
01:44:13,062 --> 01:44:14,983
Sir, please stop them.
She has a condition!

1393
01:44:15,103 --> 01:44:16,954
- Sir, something will happen to her.
- Even I have a condition.

1394
01:44:16,978 --> 01:44:18,895
Lies drive me nuts.

1395
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,200
Please leave her.

1396
01:44:20,301 --> 01:44:22,371
And keep hitting her
until she doesn't tell the truth.

1397
01:44:22,395 --> 01:44:24,853
Your sister killed him, didn't she?
Tell me who killed him!

1398
01:44:24,978 --> 01:44:26,770
- Tell me how she killed him!
- Sir...

1399
01:44:27,145 --> 01:44:27,942
Sir...

1400
01:44:28,062 --> 01:44:29,567
Tell me. How did you kill him?

1401
01:44:29,687 --> 01:44:30,983
What did you kill him with?

1402
01:44:31,103 --> 01:44:32,192
Sir, please stop them!

1403
01:44:32,312 --> 01:44:34,067
Tell me the truth and they will stop.

1404
01:44:34,187 --> 01:44:35,775
Tell me. Where did you hit him?

1405
01:44:35,895 --> 01:44:37,942
- Sir, something might happen to her.
- Tell me!

1406
01:44:38,062 --> 01:44:39,853
- Sir, she is not well.
- Tell me!

1407
01:44:39,978 --> 01:44:41,525
Sir, please stop them!

1408
01:44:41,645 --> 01:44:43,275
Tell me or I will not spare you.

1409
01:44:43,395 --> 01:44:44,400
Tell me.

1410
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,038
- Tell me or I will not spare you.
- Sir.

1411
01:44:46,062 --> 01:44:47,983
- Hey, speak up.
- Sir, call the doctor.

1412
01:44:48,103 --> 01:44:50,020
Sir, please.
I'll tell you the truth, sir.

1413
01:44:50,312 --> 01:44:52,192
Sir, call the doctor. Please, sir.

1414
01:44:52,312 --> 01:44:52,853
Gaitonde.

1415
01:44:52,978 --> 01:44:55,400
- Anju! Anju!
- Stop.

1416
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:58,067
- Anju! Anju!
- Sister! Wake up, sister.

1417
01:44:58,187 --> 01:45:01,608
- Anju! Anju! Anju!
- Wake up, sister. Sister...

1418
01:45:01,728 --> 01:45:03,437
- Anju! Anju!
- Wake up, sister.

1419
01:45:03,812 --> 01:45:04,692
Anju!

1420
01:45:04,812 --> 01:45:07,233
Anju! Anju...

1421
01:45:07,353 --> 01:45:09,478
Sister! Wake up, sister.

1422
01:45:32,478 --> 01:45:34,228
Say whatever you have to say.

1423
01:45:35,645 --> 01:45:37,353
I want to meet Anju first.

1424
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:41,478
I've had enough of you.

1425
01:45:42,270 --> 01:45:44,020
You can give your confession
if you want to.

1426
01:45:44,645 --> 01:45:47,312
Otherwise, I've other
ways to get it out of you.

1427
01:45:53,478 --> 01:45:55,312
My name is Vijay Salgaonkar,

1428
01:45:56,687 --> 01:45:58,228
and this is my confession.

1429
01:45:59,062 --> 01:46:01,062
October 2nd 2014,

1430
01:46:02,562 --> 01:46:04,728
Nandini and the kids were out.

1431
01:46:05,437 --> 01:46:07,812
I was drinking
in my office till late.

1432
01:46:09,895 --> 01:46:11,520
When I reached home,

1433
01:46:12,228 --> 01:46:16,437
I noticed someone
was trying to sneak in.

1434
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,270
There was a rod lying next to me.

1435
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:23,564
I picked up the rod
and walked in his direction.

1436
01:46:25,687 --> 01:46:27,562
I struck him with the rod on his back,

1437
01:46:27,895 --> 01:46:29,228
but he slumped.

1438
01:46:30,228 --> 01:46:32,312
And suffered a blow to his head.

1439
01:46:34,603 --> 01:46:36,270
Everything happened so quickly,

1440
01:46:37,103 --> 01:46:38,812
that I was completely baffled.

1441
01:46:41,399 --> 01:46:42,803
I went closer,

1442
01:46:44,228 --> 01:46:45,853
and realised that he was dead.

1443
01:46:46,645 --> 01:46:48,187
He was just a boy.

1444
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:51,187
As old as my daughter.

1445
01:46:52,565 --> 01:46:53,687
I was scared.

1446
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:57,603
My family would have
returned home anytime,

1447
01:46:58,770 --> 01:47:00,645
so I put the body in a sack

1448
01:47:02,145 --> 01:47:03,770
and buried him in the garden.

1449
01:47:04,562 --> 01:47:07,243
Next day I found out
from contractor Rane,

1450
01:47:08,312 --> 01:47:11,596
that the flooring work in the
police station will begin from Monday.

1451
01:47:13,645 --> 01:47:15,744
Sunday night when
everyone else was asleep,

1452
01:47:17,353 --> 01:47:21,520
I buried the dead body
in the police station.

1453
01:47:23,187 --> 01:47:24,812
Because I thought...

1454
01:47:25,687 --> 01:47:27,603
it was the safest place.

1455
01:47:30,187 --> 01:47:32,645
Are you saying all this
to save your family?

1456
01:47:34,145 --> 01:47:36,103
Truth is like a seed.

1457
01:47:36,895 --> 01:47:38,645
No matter how deep you bury it,

1458
01:47:39,187 --> 01:47:40,770
It always comes out some day.

1459
01:47:41,645 --> 01:47:45,464
But, my family shouldn't
have to suffer for my crimes.

1460
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:50,562
That's why I've kept the rod
that killed Sam,

1461
01:47:51,395 --> 01:47:56,187
and has my fingerprints on it, intact.

1462
01:48:15,062 --> 01:48:16,478
Can we arrest him now?

1463
01:48:17,895 --> 01:48:19,395
It's only a question of one day.

1464
01:48:20,395 --> 01:48:22,853
We'll have judicial custody tomorrow.
You okay?

1465
01:48:24,187 --> 01:48:25,645
Just one thing.

1466
01:48:26,770 --> 01:48:30,395
Let there be no mention
of the video that Sam made.

1467
01:48:30,645 --> 01:48:32,520
Vijay is keeping that a secret too.

1468
01:48:33,186 --> 01:48:36,062
He wouldn't want these facts
about his daughter to be made public.

1469
01:48:36,608 --> 01:48:38,062
He will go to jail,

1470
01:48:39,269 --> 01:48:41,942
but don't spare anyone
from his family, Ta run.

1471
01:48:42,062 --> 01:48:43,103
That's it.

1472
01:48:44,103 --> 01:48:45,270
Me era.

1473
01:48:46,478 --> 01:48:48,062
What is the matter with you?

1474
01:48:49,334 --> 01:48:50,603
He is going to jail.

1475
01:48:51,334 --> 01:48:53,312
Does his entire family
have to be punished too?

1476
01:48:54,770 --> 01:48:56,246
That girl is suffering
from epilepsy, for God's...

1477
01:48:56,270 --> 01:48:57,478
It was the girl!

1478
01:49:01,114 --> 01:49:02,895
And you're showing sympathy for her.

1479
01:49:03,434 --> 01:49:05,062
I am not showing sympathy.

1480
01:49:06,103 --> 01:49:07,437
It's about showing humanity.

1481
01:49:08,312 --> 01:49:09,687
You know what, Mahesh.

1482
01:49:10,103 --> 01:49:12,228
If everyone thought like you,

1483
01:49:12,603 --> 01:49:14,752
the world would've been
a different place.

1484
01:49:15,353 --> 01:49:17,062
But unfortunately that's not the case.

1485
01:49:17,728 --> 01:49:20,520
So this world needs people like us.

1486
01:49:23,603 --> 01:49:26,603
Vijay is responsible
for his own condition.

1487
01:49:28,478 --> 01:49:29,733
If he had surrendered,

1488
01:49:29,853 --> 01:49:32,395
his family wouldn't have been
in this predicament.

1489
01:49:33,964 --> 01:49:35,562
But he didn't.

1490
01:49:38,643 --> 01:49:40,312
For him it's a crusade.

1491
01:49:41,551 --> 01:49:44,483
He'll either win or lose.

1492
01:49:44,603 --> 01:49:45,938
But never compromise.

1493
01:49:48,478 --> 01:49:51,270
And if he won't compromise,
then why should we?

1494
01:49:53,645 --> 01:49:56,478
We have only one goal
in every case, Me era.

1495
01:49:57,228 --> 01:49:58,645
Deliver justice.

1496
01:50:00,603 --> 01:50:01,994
We'll do the same here.

1497
01:50:06,887 --> 01:50:09,995
[Indistinct crowd chatter]

1498
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:13,812
Fine. I'll hang up now.

1499
01:50:15,645 --> 01:50:17,228
Tell mom and dad to take care.

1500
01:50:27,812 --> 01:50:29,978
This is all my fault.

1501
01:50:40,270 --> 01:50:41,978
Don't blame yourself.

1502
01:50:43,312 --> 01:50:44,812
This was bound to happen one day.

1503
01:51:02,228 --> 01:51:03,645
You're still awake, child?

1504
01:51:05,853 --> 01:51:07,520
How could I sleep, papa?

1505
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:11,853
You took on my...

1506
01:51:30,978 --> 01:51:35,108
Yes. Goa police has found some body
remains in connection to this case.

1507
01:51:35,228 --> 01:51:38,275
They believe this body
belongs to Sameer Deshmukh.

1508
01:51:38,395 --> 01:51:40,525
After this event, Vijay Salgaonkar

1509
01:51:40,645 --> 01:51:44,442
and his family
are under the scanner again.

1510
01:51:44,562 --> 01:51:48,687
Let's watch what twists
this controversial case awaits.

1511
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:29,097
Remember what you said to me.

1512
01:52:29,847 --> 01:52:31,472
"Every dog has his day."

1513
01:52:32,389 --> 01:52:33,680
I am not a dog,

1514
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:36,555
but today is my day.

1515
01:52:39,389 --> 01:52:40,430
Get in.

1516
01:53:13,097 --> 01:53:13,935
Sir.

1517
01:53:14,055 --> 01:53:15,055
Any update?

1518
01:53:15,097 --> 01:53:16,769
We're reaching in 20 minutes.

1519
01:53:16,889 --> 01:53:18,472
Call me as soon as you reach.

1520
01:53:20,805 --> 01:53:23,014
Sir, someone's here to see you.

1521
01:53:23,347 --> 01:53:26,722
Says he wants to tell you something
urgent about Vijay Salgaonkar.

1522
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:32,389
Send him in.

1523
01:53:42,722 --> 01:53:43,889
Hello.

1524
01:53:44,555 --> 01:53:47,972
My name is Murad Ali. I write films.

1525
01:53:48,347 --> 01:53:50,560
You don't need an introduction.
Take a seat, please.

1526
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:52,430
Mr. and Mrs. Deshmukh.

1527
01:53:55,722 --> 01:53:57,514
You haven't been writing
any films recently?

1528
01:53:59,472 --> 01:54:01,935
Actually, after my wife's demise,

1529
01:54:02,055 --> 01:54:04,389
I stopped writing.

1530
01:54:04,764 --> 01:54:07,514
I... live in Dubai now.
I've settled down there.

1531
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:11,639
You wanted to tell us
something about Vijay.

1532
01:54:12,014 --> 01:54:13,014
Yes.

1533
01:54:15,389 --> 01:54:18,014
My first meeting with him was in 2016.

1534
01:54:18,930 --> 01:54:21,180
I knew very little about this case.

1535
01:54:21,430 --> 01:54:23,305
But I couldn't recognise him.

1536
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:28,972
Because he said
his name was Vijay Godbole.

1537
01:54:32,347 --> 01:54:34,347
Have we ever met before?

1538
01:54:34,805 --> 01:54:37,139
Your face looks awfully familiar.

1539
01:54:38,597 --> 01:54:40,680
I've been on your film sets often.

1540
01:54:41,389 --> 01:54:43,014
We also spoke once.

1541
01:54:43,305 --> 01:54:45,472
I didn't have a beard back then.

1542
01:54:45,764 --> 01:54:49,389
Ahh... I was wondering
where I've seen you.

1543
01:54:49,805 --> 01:54:52,472
So tell me how can I help you?

1544
01:54:53,389 --> 01:54:54,472
Murad sir,

1545
01:54:55,972 --> 01:54:57,352
I've a story.

1546
01:54:57,472 --> 01:54:59,952
If you can spare 15 minutes,
I would like to narrate it to you.

1547
01:55:01,014 --> 01:55:02,014
Fine.

1548
01:55:02,139 --> 01:55:05,352
He narrated his story to me,
and I was stunned.

1549
01:55:05,472 --> 01:55:07,019
It was an incredible story.

1550
01:55:07,139 --> 01:55:09,514
So I immediately said yes
to write a script.

1551
01:55:09,847 --> 01:55:12,055
He paid me a million
rupees as advance.

1552
01:55:12,389 --> 01:55:14,389
And said he will
also produce the film.

1553
01:55:15,389 --> 01:55:16,680
But he had a condition.

1554
01:55:17,430 --> 01:55:18,514
What condition?

1555
01:55:20,972 --> 01:55:24,847
His condition was we
won't start making the film,

1556
01:55:25,097 --> 01:55:29,055
until we both don't agree that
the film's script is completely ready.

1557
01:55:30,430 --> 01:55:34,180
During our first meeting
his story was nearly complete.

1558
01:55:34,305 --> 01:55:37,602
But it took us two years
to complete the script.

1559
01:55:37,722 --> 01:55:42,352
Actually, he wanted every detail in
the script to be completely logical,

1560
01:55:42,472 --> 01:55:44,180
and well researched.

1561
01:55:49,180 --> 01:55:51,680
There is one thing
that's been eating me up.

1562
01:55:52,472 --> 01:55:56,180
You guys must know
the story of this film.

1563
01:55:56,597 --> 01:55:59,347
Murad sir, we're running short
on time, so you'll have to hurry up.

1564
01:55:59,805 --> 01:56:00,805
Yes.

1565
01:56:01,430 --> 01:56:03,597
The story begins in Pondolem.

1566
01:56:05,097 --> 01:56:10,930
A guy called Ram
loves his son Yatin unconditionally.

1567
01:56:12,347 --> 01:56:15,764
One night Yatin is out
partying with his friends.

1568
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:19,639
In the club,
a guy in his drunken stupor,

1569
01:56:20,014 --> 01:56:22,764
begins to misbehave with his friend.

1570
01:56:24,389 --> 01:56:26,310
He was not some ordinary boy.

1571
01:56:26,430 --> 01:56:28,389
He was the son of a prominent builder.

1572
01:56:28,930 --> 01:56:32,894
Even after requesting him
dozens of times, he doesn't listen.

1573
01:56:33,014 --> 01:56:34,597
And things get out of hand.

1574
01:56:35,264 --> 01:56:38,639
Yatin publicly slaps the boy.

1575
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:51,680
In a fit of rage,
the boy follows Yatin to get revenge.

1576
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:56,472
They both get in a scuffle.

1577
01:56:58,180 --> 01:57:02,389
And Yatin accidentally kills the boy.

1578
01:57:03,889 --> 01:57:05,810
When Ram returns home,

1579
01:57:05,930 --> 01:57:12,014
he sees his son crying inconsolably
next to the boy's dead body.

1580
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:16,435
Ram knew that the boy
was a son of a well-known builder.

1581
01:57:16,555 --> 01:57:18,139
And if he didn't do something,

1582
01:57:18,264 --> 01:57:22,430
his son's life would
be ruined forever.

1583
01:57:22,805 --> 01:57:24,269
Ram thought a lot.

1584
01:57:24,389 --> 01:57:29,264
It struck him that the builder's
new building was under construction.

1585
01:57:29,722 --> 01:57:32,139
And he buried the boy's dead body,

1586
01:57:32,264 --> 01:57:34,805
under his father's new building.

1587
01:57:37,863 --> 01:57:41,514
And yet he knew that the police
will come for him someday.

1588
01:57:41,847 --> 01:57:45,019
The second half of
the film is all about,

1589
01:57:45,139 --> 01:57:49,852
how he gathered evidence
against himself to save his family.

1590
01:57:49,972 --> 01:57:52,389
In the climax,
the police find the body.

1591
01:57:52,722 --> 01:57:57,305
And Ram confesses to
the crime to save his son.

1592
01:57:57,514 --> 01:58:01,347
So... he was making
a film on his own life.

1593
01:58:01,555 --> 01:58:02,977
I don't understand this.

1594
01:58:03,097 --> 01:58:05,060
You said you met him in 2016.

1595
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:05,769
Yes.

1596
01:58:05,889 --> 01:58:08,269
If the script is ready,
why wasn't the film made?

1597
01:58:08,389 --> 01:58:10,406
Maybe he was afraid that
the film could get him in trouble.

1598
01:58:10,430 --> 01:58:12,019
No, that's not the case.

1599
01:58:12,139 --> 01:58:16,055
Actually, both of us were
unhappy with the film's ending.

1600
01:58:16,472 --> 01:58:19,519
Although he was afraid
that the story might get stolen,

1601
01:58:19,639 --> 01:58:21,019
and lose copyright.

1602
01:58:21,139 --> 01:58:25,615
So he had the story published
in the form of a book.

1603
01:58:26,597 --> 01:58:27,597
What?

1604
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:31,180
When?

1605
01:58:32,097 --> 01:58:32,977
One year ago.

1606
01:58:33,097 --> 01:58:35,019
Is the novel available in the market?

1607
01:58:35,139 --> 01:58:36,935
Not many copies were published...

1608
01:58:37,055 --> 01:58:39,310
Is the book available or not.

1609
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:40,894
You may find it if you look hard.

1610
01:58:41,014 --> 01:58:42,454
Was it published under Vijay's name?

1611
01:58:42,569 --> 01:58:43,569
No.

1612
01:58:44,542 --> 01:58:46,847
And this is why I am here.

1613
01:58:48,264 --> 01:58:50,264
Because the book was published
under my name.

1614
01:58:50,644 --> 01:58:51,935
Under whose name were the bills?

1615
01:58:52,055 --> 01:58:55,352
He made all the payments,
but the bills were in my name.

1616
01:58:55,472 --> 01:58:57,019
Was it bank transfer or cash?

1617
01:58:57,139 --> 01:58:59,019
Cash. Although I told him clearly...

1618
01:58:59,139 --> 01:59:00,519
Okay.

1619
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:02,977
You said you were not
happy with the film's ending.

1620
01:59:03,097 --> 01:59:03,727
Yes.

1621
01:59:03,847 --> 01:59:07,622
So we started working
on new ideas for a new ending.

1622
01:59:13,889 --> 01:59:14,727
Yes.

1623
01:59:14,847 --> 01:59:17,514
Sir, there is a problem.

1624
01:59:18,014 --> 01:59:19,164
What happened?

1625
01:59:25,514 --> 01:59:28,305
Next day I found out
from contractor Rane,

1626
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:31,805
that the flooring work in the police
station will begin from Monday.

1627
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:36,389
Sunday night
when everyone else was asleep,

1628
01:59:36,555 --> 01:59:39,764
I buried the dead body
in police station.

1629
01:59:40,722 --> 01:59:41,764
Your hon our,

1630
01:59:42,055 --> 01:59:45,889
the police tortured this
statement out of my client.

1631
01:59:46,764 --> 01:59:48,097
Is it true?

1632
01:59:50,055 --> 01:59:51,305
Yes, your hon our.

1633
01:59:52,930 --> 01:59:54,180
I don't get this guy.

1634
01:59:54,597 --> 01:59:55,847
What does he want now?

1635
01:59:57,055 --> 01:59:59,889
Doesn't matter what he wants, Mahesh.
He cannot escape this time.

1636
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:01,519
It's over for him.

1637
02:00:01,639 --> 02:00:02,722
No, Me era.

1638
02:00:05,805 --> 02:00:07,722
I fear this is the beginning
of something.

1639
02:00:12,722 --> 02:00:14,852
Your hon our, the entire
case is completely fictional,

1640
02:00:14,972 --> 02:00:19,514
and the story's was stolen by police
from this novel called 'Drishyam'.

1641
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:23,769
The statement they have submitted
in court claiming to be Vijay's,

1642
02:00:23,889 --> 02:00:26,889
has been lifted word-by-word
from this novel.

1643
02:00:28,972 --> 02:00:30,852
He's up to his games again.

1644
02:00:30,972 --> 02:00:34,722
As he said 'it's just the beginning'.

1645
02:00:35,139 --> 02:00:36,389
What?

1646
02:00:37,264 --> 02:00:39,894
Vijay came to meet me
after the script was finished.

1647
02:00:40,014 --> 02:00:41,680
Murad sir, the ending has a problem.

1648
02:00:41,930 --> 02:00:42,930
What?

1649
02:00:43,930 --> 02:00:45,055
Hero is going to jail.

1650
02:00:45,764 --> 02:00:47,889
The public won't
like endings like this.

1651
02:00:48,597 --> 02:00:50,014
If the film has to be a hit,

1652
02:00:50,305 --> 02:00:51,764
he must win in the end.

1653
02:00:53,389 --> 02:00:54,972
I have some ideas,

1654
02:00:55,430 --> 02:00:57,680
but I need your help
to write them down.

1655
02:00:58,180 --> 02:00:58,935
Tell me.

1656
02:00:59,055 --> 02:01:00,269
This story occurs in Pondolem.

1657
02:01:00,389 --> 02:01:01,389
Yes.

1658
02:01:02,347 --> 02:01:05,139
So if the police actually find a body,

1659
02:01:05,930 --> 02:01:07,555
what will be the next step?

1660
02:01:08,305 --> 02:01:09,394
I can find out.

1661
02:01:09,514 --> 02:01:11,602
I've good connections with the police.

1662
02:01:11,722 --> 02:01:13,322
So I got all the information
he asked for

1663
02:01:13,389 --> 02:01:14,972
from the police and gave him.

1664
02:01:15,305 --> 02:01:17,889
And based on that information
he created an ending.

1665
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:21,139
I told him immediately
that it's a very risky ending.

1666
02:01:22,597 --> 02:01:24,180
He agreed too.

1667
02:01:24,472 --> 02:01:27,180
So we dropped that idea.

1668
02:01:27,305 --> 02:01:29,352
Okay, what was the ending?

1669
02:01:29,472 --> 02:01:30,472
Can you tell us?

1670
02:01:37,097 --> 02:01:39,930
I fear that Vijay...

1671
02:01:49,389 --> 02:01:51,639
There are too many coincidences
in his case.

1672
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:55,680
Sameer Deshmukh's body,
about which they had no clue,

1673
02:01:56,014 --> 02:01:59,055
was found in their own
police station like in this novel.

1674
02:01:59,430 --> 02:02:02,930
Your hon our, police station is a place,
that's directly under their control.

1675
02:02:03,472 --> 02:02:05,930
The people have no idea
what's going on inside.

1676
02:02:06,930 --> 02:02:10,180
The truth is,
Me era Deshmukh has always held,

1677
02:02:10,305 --> 02:02:13,889
the Salgaonkar family
responsible for her son's death.

1678
02:02:14,305 --> 02:02:16,685
Years later when the
police find his dead body,

1679
02:02:16,805 --> 02:02:18,269
they kept it under wraps.

1680
02:02:18,389 --> 02:02:21,389
And wait for a perfect plot.

1681
02:02:21,764 --> 02:02:23,389
- And then...
- Objection, your hon our!

1682
02:02:23,847 --> 02:02:26,180
- The defence has...
- Siraj sir.

1683
02:02:26,555 --> 02:02:29,180
I don't understand what's going on?

1684
02:02:29,764 --> 02:02:31,019
As per the DNA report,

1685
02:02:31,139 --> 02:02:33,389
this skeleton doesn't belong
to Sameer Deshmukh.

1686
02:02:48,930 --> 02:02:50,722
What was the climax?

1687
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:57,139
The hero knew that the police
will find the dead body someday.

1688
02:02:57,930 --> 02:02:59,264
And that's why,

1689
02:02:59,764 --> 02:03:03,389
he began working on changing his fate.

1690
02:03:04,353 --> 02:03:08,019
He starts looking for a body,

1691
02:03:08,139 --> 02:03:11,972
who's age, height and weight
matches with the boy.

1692
02:03:12,389 --> 02:03:16,014
And died due to trauma to the head.

1693
02:03:16,514 --> 02:03:19,639
And one day his search
comes to an end.

1694
02:03:19,889 --> 02:03:21,847
[Chanting prayer continue]

1695
02:03:26,430 --> 02:03:31,389
The hero meets someone
at the funeral and gets acquainted.

1696
02:03:34,930 --> 02:03:40,060
Eventually, he befriends the guy,
and visits him often.

1697
02:03:40,180 --> 02:03:45,472
The hero found out how long it takes,
for a human body to turn into a skeleton.

1698
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:48,264
The man was knee-deep in debts.

1699
02:03:48,555 --> 02:03:52,389
The hero paid off his debts
and won his trust.

1700
02:03:52,889 --> 02:03:56,269
When the boy's body
turned into a skeleton,

1701
02:03:56,389 --> 02:04:00,597
the hero told his new friend
about his requirement.

1702
02:04:05,305 --> 02:04:08,519
The obligated guy helped his saviour,

1703
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:11,680
and gave him the boy's skeleton.

1704
02:04:17,014 --> 02:04:19,394
During this time
the hero also found out,

1705
02:04:19,514 --> 02:04:23,977
if the police found the body
then what will be the next step.

1706
02:04:24,097 --> 02:04:25,639
If the body is found,

1707
02:04:25,972 --> 02:04:28,060
then the police will take it
to Pondolem...

1708
02:04:28,180 --> 02:04:31,930
to Andrew's medical college,
which is three hours from here.

1709
02:04:32,264 --> 02:04:35,352
The forensic experts runs tests.

1710
02:04:35,472 --> 02:04:37,639
Like the age of the deceased.

1711
02:04:38,389 --> 02:04:40,097
His gender...

1712
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:42,139
Cause of his death.

1713
02:04:42,264 --> 02:04:44,139
When all the tests are done,

1714
02:04:44,389 --> 02:04:47,560
then the body is sent for a DNA test.

1715
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:49,680
All this is done during daytime.

1716
02:05:05,972 --> 02:05:08,882
After that, the hero
befriends the security guard,

1717
02:05:09,002 --> 02:05:11,389
of the forensic department.

1718
02:05:20,889 --> 02:05:22,894
They both become good friends.

1719
02:05:23,014 --> 02:05:24,597
- How are you?
- Vijay.

1720
02:05:24,972 --> 02:05:25,769
Make two.

1721
02:05:25,889 --> 02:05:30,264
And eventually the hero finds out
the security guard's weakness.

1722
02:05:30,389 --> 02:05:34,639
Vijay, I always wanted
to act in films.

1723
02:05:34,847 --> 02:05:36,639
I've a really good actor.

1724
02:05:37,139 --> 02:05:40,180
Give me a chance in your film.

1725
02:05:40,764 --> 02:05:41,939
Can I?

1726
02:05:45,180 --> 02:05:46,685
Are there cameras here?

1727
02:05:46,805 --> 02:05:48,519
There is no such thing here, Vijay.

1728
02:05:48,639 --> 02:05:51,644
It's just me, mosquitoes,

1729
02:05:51,764 --> 02:05:54,389
and we're partying.

1730
02:05:54,805 --> 02:05:55,930
Come, Vijay.

1731
02:05:59,180 --> 02:06:02,305
After winning the
security guard's trust,

1732
02:06:02,889 --> 02:06:04,597
the hero lies in wait.

1733
02:06:05,597 --> 02:06:06,972
Years passed,

1734
02:06:07,389 --> 02:06:10,889
and finally the day arrived
that he feared.

1735
02:06:11,389 --> 02:06:13,389
The police found the body.

1736
02:07:03,889 --> 02:07:04,889
Yes, Vijay.

1737
02:07:04,930 --> 02:07:05,769
Where are you?

1738
02:07:05,889 --> 02:07:07,264
In the office.

1739
02:07:07,597 --> 02:07:08,814
Stay there. I am coming.

1740
02:09:07,930 --> 02:09:09,560
Didn't you see these reports?

1741
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:12,889
Your hon our, I was told
these reports haven't arrived yet.

1742
02:09:14,226 --> 02:09:15,889
I want to talk to your IG.

1743
02:09:16,347 --> 02:09:17,740
- Yes, sir.
- Send him to my chamber.

1744
02:09:17,764 --> 02:09:18,764
- Immediately.
- Yes, sir.

1745
02:09:19,847 --> 02:09:22,930
Your client can leave,
on personal bond.

1746
02:09:23,272 --> 02:09:25,722
Much obliged, your hon our.
I've another request.

1747
02:09:26,014 --> 02:09:27,394
We're going to file a petition

1748
02:09:27,514 --> 02:09:30,430
in the honourable high court of Goa,
to dismiss this case forever.

1749
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:35,139
Until then no new action should be
taken against the Salgaonkar family.

1750
02:09:35,722 --> 02:09:36,764
Noted.

1751
02:10:33,097 --> 02:10:34,638
For him it's a crusade.

1752
02:10:35,513 --> 02:10:38,555
He'll either win or lose.

1753
02:10:38,889 --> 02:10:40,472
But never compromise.

1754
02:10:59,046 --> 02:11:00,884
What the hell just happened, Ah law at?

1755
02:11:01,004 --> 02:11:02,593
What were you trying to do,

1756
02:11:02,713 --> 02:11:04,879
by presenting a story
from a novel as a case?

1757
02:11:07,088 --> 02:11:10,421
Your hon our,
the story that you mention...

1758
02:11:11,174 --> 02:11:14,093
The beauty of that story is,
though it's real,

1759
02:11:14,213 --> 02:11:15,629
it's not become fictional.

1760
02:11:16,726 --> 02:11:19,629
We all know what the truth is,
but couldn't prove it.

1761
02:11:21,387 --> 02:11:25,796
Who would believe that an ordinary
cable operator can plan all this?

1762
02:11:28,377 --> 02:11:31,338
But fate favoured him.
He won and we lost.

1763
02:11:33,863 --> 02:11:36,004
And I take full responsibility
of this defeat.

1764
02:11:36,463 --> 02:11:38,421
Well, off the record, Ah law at.

1765
02:11:38,697 --> 02:11:41,463
Unsolved cases are nothing new
sin our system.

1766
02:11:44,973 --> 02:11:46,193
Jai Hind, sir.

1767
02:12:18,879 --> 02:12:21,129
Despite all the justifications,

1768
02:12:21,546 --> 02:12:26,193
the hero can never look
in the eyes of the boy's parents.

1769
02:12:37,088 --> 02:12:39,213
The story isn't over yet.

1770
02:12:41,003 --> 02:12:42,963
The climax is left.

1771
02:13:28,671 --> 02:13:31,463
I'm giving you what you asked for.

1772
02:13:34,879 --> 02:13:36,546
I've just one request.

1773
02:13:37,349 --> 02:13:39,463
Leave my family alone.

1774
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:45,399
[Chanting prayer continue]

1775
02:13:53,469 --> 02:13:55,713
We got the closure we needed, Me era.

1776
02:13:56,588 --> 02:13:58,088
It's done.

1777
02:14:01,546 --> 02:14:02,713
Me era.

1778
02:14:04,088 --> 02:14:05,921
Let him go, please.

1779
02:14:09,338 --> 02:14:10,546
Please.

1780
02:14:12,463 --> 02:14:13,721
Me era.

1781
02:14:18,963 --> 02:14:20,142
No, Me era.

1782
02:14:21,254 --> 02:14:23,958
We thought
we were keeping an eye on him.

1783
02:14:24,588 --> 02:14:26,379
But the truth was,

1784
02:14:26,959 --> 02:14:30,206
he was watching us... all this time.

1785
02:14:59,050 --> 02:15:00,254
Where were you?

1786
02:15:03,362 --> 02:15:05,004
Had to return someone something.

1787
02:15:06,023 --> 02:15:07,213
Shall we go?

1788
02:15:23,516 --> 02:15:25,891
Every human has
three kinds of world.

1789
02:15:26,555 --> 02:15:29,432
One that's inside him.

1790
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:32,266
The second is the physical world.

1791
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:37,724
And the third
which he creates himself.

1792
02:15:38,143 --> 02:15:39,974
And can't live without it.

1793
02:15:40,528 --> 02:15:42,807
For me, my family is my world.

1794
02:15:43,794 --> 02:15:45,766
I can do anything for them.

1795
02:15:45,886 --> 02:15:47,766
Go to any limits.

1796
02:15:48,261 --> 02:15:50,463
Whether someone calls him selfish

1797
02:15:50,995 --> 02:15:52,307
or self-centred.
