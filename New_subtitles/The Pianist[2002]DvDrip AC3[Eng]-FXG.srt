JEWS FORBIDDEN

2
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:01,407
You!

3
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:04,493
Come here.

4
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,459
Why haven't you greeted us?

5
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,421
I'm sorry.

6
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:28,183
The sidewalk is forbidden for you.

7
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:30,394
Go to the gutter.

8
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:17,968
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?
- What's wrong with you?

9
00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:22,306
- Come on, do something.
- Right. Dance!

10
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:25,142
- Dance!
- Dance!

11
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,145
Come on, come on! Dance!

12
00:18:31,273 --> 00:18:32,983
Very well.

13
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,069
What about you?
Dance with him.

14
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:40,574
Let's clear the street,
so the Jews can dance.

15
00:18:43,744 --> 00:18:45,954
Come on. And you.

16
00:18:51,794 --> 00:18:53,420
Go on.

17
00:18:54,922 --> 00:18:55,839
Faster!

18
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:59,551
Come on!

19
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:02,137
Faster!

20
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:07,518
Come on!

21
00:19:08,352 --> 00:19:10,854
Faster!

22
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:17,486
Come on, move! I said faster!
Come on, Jews!

23
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:20,572
- Keep dancing.
- Dance.

24
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:56,575
Hold it!
You little bastard!

25
00:27:55,504 --> 00:27:59,591
Turn on the lights.

26
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:04,721
Come on!

27
00:28:07,516 --> 00:28:11,687
Open the door!
Let us in!

28
00:28:13,522 --> 00:28:15,399
Open the door!

29
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,622
Stand up!

30
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:36,128
You, stand up! Come on!

31
00:28:36,754 --> 00:28:39,214
Throw him out!

32
00:29:09,824 --> 00:29:10,119
Come on, run!

33
00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:39,663
- Hands up.
- How are you?

34
00:32:39,872 --> 00:32:43,417
- How are you?
- You, bandit.

35
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:45,711
Dead! Dead!

36
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,964
- He's crazy.
- Hands up.

37
00:32:49,173 --> 00:32:52,176
- Want a cigarette?
- Cigarette?

38
00:32:52,676 --> 00:32:55,554
Thank you.

39
00:32:56,221 --> 00:33:00,017
Everything is alright!

40
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:02,269
He looks very happy.

41
00:33:02,478 --> 00:33:05,230
Everything is alright.

42
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:08,692
Everything is alright.

43
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:12,654
Hands up! Hands up!

44
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:14,448
It's alright.

45
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,285
Help! Help!

46
00:33:18,494 --> 00:33:21,997
Let go! Help!

47
00:38:30,556 --> 00:38:33,559
At least we got work
in the ghetto.

48
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:36,770
At least we are still together.

49
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:53,786
Everybody out!
To the courtyard!

50
00:38:53,995 --> 00:38:55,247
Move, move!

51
00:38:55,831 --> 00:39:00,002
We are workers. We have
employment certification.

52
00:39:07,676 --> 00:39:10,679
Go over there. Hurry.

53
00:39:10,888 --> 00:39:12,765
You.

54
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,726
You. You.

55
00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:19,188
You.

56
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:22,649
You.

57
00:39:24,026 --> 00:39:26,111
You.

58
00:39:34,578 --> 00:39:37,873
The others, put your clothes on
and come back here.

59
00:39:38,082 --> 00:39:41,126
Bring your things with you.
15 kilos only.

60
00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:44,129
Where are you taking us?

61
00:52:25,898 --> 00:52:28,185
Attention!
Forward march!

62
00:52:37,778 --> 00:52:39,655
Onward! 

63
00:54:06,867 --> 00:54:09,161
Turn left!

64
00:54:09,369 --> 00:54:11,747
On the march!

65
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:18,420
Stop! Halt!
Attention!

66
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:28,263
At ease.

67
00:54:32,184 --> 00:54:34,853
Turn right!

68
00:54:41,735 --> 00:54:44,321
Step forward.

69
00:54:44,863 --> 00:54:46,365
You.

70
00:54:48,534 --> 00:54:51,036
You. You.

71
00:54:51,703 --> 00:54:53,455
You.

72
00:54:57,251 --> 00:54:59,253
Down on the ground!

73
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,464
Down on the ground!

74
00:55:28,615 --> 00:55:30,659
Turn left!

75
00:55:31,785 --> 00:55:34,121
On the march.

76
00:58:01,934 --> 00:58:04,146
You! Come here!

77
00:58:29,254 --> 00:58:33,509
Take this! Take this!

78
00:58:47,564 --> 00:58:50,275
Take him away.

79
00:59:39,533 --> 00:59:41,910
Round up only the Jews!

80
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:44,955
Round up!
Only the Jews.

81
00:59:45,205 --> 00:59:48,459
The Polish keep working.
Only the Jews.

82
01:01:08,407 --> 01:01:09,491
Dismiss them.

83
01:04:34,488 --> 01:04:37,074
Have you got a plaster?

84
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:49,169
What are you up to?

85
01:04:50,713 --> 01:04:53,132
What have you got there?

86
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:57,136
We are allowed to take
food to the ghetto.

87
01:04:57,344 --> 01:05:00,055
Three kilos of potato and bread.

88
01:05:00,222 --> 01:05:02,266
Open it.

89
01:05:05,853 --> 01:05:10,649
- It's only potatoes and bread.
- You're lying. That's not true.

90
01:05:12,026 --> 01:05:14,111
Open it.

91
01:05:40,929 --> 01:05:43,015
Potatoes!

92
01:05:46,518 --> 01:05:49,438
You Jews are all alike.

93
01:05:49,647 --> 01:05:53,192
We offer you a finger...

94
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:56,278
and you take the whole hand.

95
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:13,212
If you lie to me again,
I'll kill you. Personally.

96
01:06:45,618 --> 01:06:46,453
- Halt!

97
01:06:50,124 --> 01:06:52,668
Wait. What's going on here?

98
01:06:52,876 --> 01:06:56,380
Take this! Take this!

99
01:07:02,386 --> 01:07:06,265
I'll teach you some discipline,
you dirty Jews.

100
01:07:10,436 --> 01:07:12,688
Do you know why
you're being hit?

101
01:07:12,855 --> 01:07:15,899
- No.
- Do you know why you're being hit?

102
01:07:16,108 --> 01:07:20,446
- Why?
- To celebrate New Year.

103
01:07:22,656 --> 01:07:24,825
On the march!

104
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:27,536
March and sing!

105
01:07:27,953 --> 01:07:29,621
Sing something nice!

106
01:07:30,331 --> 01:07:33,167
Loud and clear!

107
01:08:30,099 --> 01:08:32,059
Come.

108
01:13:26,978 --> 01:13:27,988
DO NOT PASS

109
01:16:20,194 --> 01:16:24,073
Spread out!
We're being attacked!

110
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:28,786
Take cover!

111
01:16:30,371 --> 01:16:31,330
Shoot!

112
01:16:42,967 --> 01:16:45,719
Take cover! Fire!

113
01:16:49,723 --> 01:16:52,393
Come on, get out!

114
01:18:16,352 --> 01:18:18,520
The attack was successful.

115
01:18:20,481 --> 01:18:22,608
That building...

116
01:18:30,074 --> 01:18:32,076
Turn around!

117
01:18:38,499 --> 01:18:40,334
Shoot!

118
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,405
Come here.

119
01:34:26,572 --> 01:34:28,699
Be careful with it.

120
01:34:29,575 --> 01:34:32,411
That's it. Be careful.

121
01:39:58,570 --> 01:40:00,823
Throw a grenade!

122
01:40:08,747 --> 01:40:11,166
There's a wounded man over there!

123
01:40:11,667 --> 01:40:14,086
Come.

124
01:40:14,211 --> 01:40:16,547
Watch out! Watch out!

125
01:40:17,631 --> 01:40:20,467
- I'll go get help!
- Hurry!

126
01:40:21,093 --> 01:40:24,930
Come on! Bring the stretcher!

127
01:40:28,642 --> 01:40:31,145
Go back inside!

128
01:44:01,188 --> 01:44:04,233
Are you alright?
There's too much dust.

129
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:08,988
I'll check this side.
Don't worry.

130
01:44:09,196 --> 01:44:11,532
Be careful!

131
01:44:16,745 --> 01:44:19,290
- Heinrich?
- I'm checking!

132
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:24,169
Is there anybody here?

133
01:44:28,090 --> 01:44:32,052
- Come on down!
- Alright, I'm coming.

134
01:48:30,124 --> 01:48:31,875
Come on, pile them up.

135
01:48:37,965 --> 01:48:40,050
Throw it.

136
01:50:00,881 --> 01:50:03,717
We have to mark everything.

137
01:50:04,718 --> 01:50:05,636
Come on.

138
01:56:49,581 --> 01:56:51,875
What are you doing here?

139
01:56:56,130 --> 01:56:58,382
Who are you?

140
01:57:02,344 --> 01:57:05,764
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

141
01:57:07,808 --> 01:57:09,977
What are you doing?

142
01:57:15,524 --> 01:57:17,401
I was...

143
01:57:17,568 --> 01:57:20,487
trying to open this can.

144
01:57:21,155 --> 01:57:23,699
Do you live here?

145
01:57:26,035 --> 01:57:27,911
Do you work here?

146
01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:29,747
No.

147
01:57:33,250 --> 01:57:35,669
What do you do for a living?

148
01:57:38,589 --> 01:57:40,299
I am...

149
01:57:41,884 --> 01:57:44,720
I was a pianist.

150
01:57:46,764 --> 01:57:48,891
Pianist?

151
01:58:06,909 --> 01:58:08,827
Come.

152
01:58:32,768 --> 01:58:34,895
Play something.

153
02:03:41,035 --> 02:03:43,704
Are you hiding here?

154
02:03:48,250 --> 02:03:49,877
Jew?

155
02:03:52,755 --> 02:03:55,049
Where are you hiding yourself?

156
02:03:56,634 --> 02:03:58,552
In the attic.

157
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:03,891
Show it to me.

158
02:04:26,413 --> 02:04:28,624
Have you got anything to eat?

159
02:05:13,085 --> 02:05:18,424
According to them,
it's very important that...

160
02:05:24,888 --> 02:05:26,598
Attention!

161
02:05:28,225 --> 02:05:31,145
- At ease.
- At ease.

162
02:06:33,707 --> 02:06:35,626
Jew?

163
02:06:49,473 --> 02:06:50,849
Please.

164
02:06:51,266 --> 02:06:53,227
What does it mean,
all that shooting?

165
02:06:53,769 --> 02:06:56,397
The Russians,
on the other side of the river.

166
02:06:57,690 --> 02:07:01,026
You just have to hold on
a couple of weeks, not more.

167
02:08:28,781 --> 02:08:31,450
- What's going on?
- We're leaving.

168
02:08:34,286 --> 02:08:37,456
- Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.

169
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:43,963
I don't know how to thank you.

170
02:08:45,381 --> 02:08:47,508
Thank God, not me.

171
02:08:47,925 --> 02:08:53,305
He wants us to survive. At least,
we have to believe in that.

172
02:09:02,731 --> 02:09:05,943
Here. Take it.

173
02:09:06,944 --> 02:09:11,073
- And you?
- I have another one. Warmer.

174
02:09:15,327 --> 02:09:18,747
What are you going to do
when this is over?

175
02:09:20,499 --> 02:09:24,670
I'll play piano again at
the Polish radio station.

176
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:27,214
Tell me your name.

177
02:09:27,423 --> 02:09:29,967
Maybe I'll listen to you playing.

178
02:09:30,134 --> 02:09:32,177
Szpilman.

179
02:09:36,223 --> 02:09:38,976
Perfect name for a pianist.

180
02:12:43,577 --> 02:12:45,162
Musician?

181
02:12:46,330 --> 02:12:48,207
Are you a musician?

182
02:12:49,166 --> 02:12:51,210
Do you know...

183
02:12:51,543 --> 02:12:54,588
a pianist called Szpilman,
from the Polish radio station?

184
02:12:54,797 --> 02:12:59,760
- Of course I know him.
- I helped him to hide himself.

185
02:13:00,552 --> 02:13:02,596
Tell him I'm here.

186
02:13:03,347 --> 02:13:05,432
Ask him to help me.

187
02:13:08,394 --> 02:13:11,021
- What's your name?
- Hosenfeld.

188
02:13:11,272 --> 02:13:12,439
What?
